MAC,GOD SAVE THE SHEEN,Lipgloss,"a light-medium lavender with warm, pink undertones and fine pink, lavender, and gold pearl. It had semi-sheer color coverage (and it was described as “sheer”) that applied evenly, though there was some of the milkier base that pulled into my lip lines. It wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance, thankfully! The texture was lightweight (but more medium in consistency) with moderate tackiness but was comfortable to wear. The color stayed on well for four hours and was moisturizing.",B+
MAC,BUZZ CUT,Lipgloss,"a milky, translucent base with flecks of pink and white sparkle. It had semi-sheer to medium “coverage” (peek my lip freckle barely showing!) between the milkiness of the base along with the sparkle/shimmer. For as milky as it was, it didn’t emphasize my lip lines quite as much as I expected, and the amount of shininess and sparkliness helped distract from that at a normal viewing distance. The texture was smooth, spreadable, and lightweight despite having a more light-medium thickness (and moderate tackiness). It wore well for three and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.
",B
MAC,I AM TOO SMART,Lipgloss,"a soft beige base with lots of multi-colored pearl dominated by gold. The gloss applied evenly and smoothly across my lips without settling into my lip lines, so it made my lips appear fuller and plumper. It had semi-sheer to medium color coverage between the base color and shimmer, but I’d say a lot of the “coverage” came from the shimmer. The consistency was noticeably tacky but comfortable to wear, as it wasn’t too heavy on. It lasted well for four hours and was moisturizing over time.
",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,AFRICAN VIOLET,Palette,"a new, permanent palette that includes a pop of purple, copper-gold, soft brown, and rich orange-red. I liked how the colors came together in a look, though I wouldn’t consider it overly versatile–like I’m not seeing lots of variations of looks with these four shades. The only shade I had any trouble with was the sparkly shade (#2), which was about as expected based on past experience with Tom Ford’s quads that often include a glitter finish shade that still has room for improvement.",B+
NARS,SINGAPORE,Palette,"a new set of warm-toned shades–three of which have some sort of sparkle–that coordinated well with each other in terms of color/undertone. This quad is going to be better suited for someone who likes to use their eyeshadows with a dampened brush, fingertips, or an adhesive base as one shade required that and one improved noticeably (two were good over bare skin).",B-
MAC,AUDIBLE,Lipgloss,"a medium, peachy orange with very fine, gold pearl over a cream finish. It was more of a cream finish than a shimmery gloss, though. It had good color coverage in a single layer that applied evenly without streaking, but the downside was there was some product that pulled into my deeper lip lines. The shinier finish helped to make that appear less noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The consistency was smooth, light-medium in thickness with a lightweight feel, and had moderate tackiness. It lasted well for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.
",B+
MAC,BRACELETS GALORE,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium-dark fuchsia pink with very subtle, cool undertones and cooler pink sparkle and pearl. It had semi-sheer color payoff in a single layer, and this shade was described as “sheer” by the brand, so it wasn’t too far off. The gloss had a lightweight feel, but it was thicker than the average gloss with moderate stickiness, which helped to stay in place longer. Some of the color sank into my lip lines and was only noticeable from a normal viewing distance after the gloss started to wear down (when the shine dissipated). It wore well for five hours and was moisturizing over time.",B+
MAC,DEEP SET,Lipgloss,"a deep, purplish-plum with subtle, warm undertones and multi-colored pearl–it primarily flashed green and teal to my eye. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly across my lips and didn’t emphasize my lip lines. The texture was noticeably tacky but spread easily across my lips and was comfortable to wear as it was lightweight, despite feeling thicker. It stayed on well for five hours and was hydrating while worn.",A-
ESSENCE,BE MY SUNLIGHT,Highlighter,"a soft, golden peach with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation paired with a soft, slightly dusty consistency that had a bit of excess powder that kicked up in the pan, but it ended up applying quite well to bare skin. I worried the powder was going to be drier or go on unevenly on my cheeks, but the highlighter applied evenly, blended out easily along the edges, and did not appear dry/dusty on. It lasted nicely for eight hours on me before it started to show signs of fading.
",A-
DIOR,VOLCANIC,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette featuring five shades. The color combination was more on the unexpected side, so it was fun to try pairing much warmer tones with cooler silver/gray shades. Most of the shades had good pigmentation and longevity with easy application as they went on evenly and blended out nicely.",A-
MAC,RAVER GIRL,Palette,"a new, permanent palette (per MAC’s website) featuring eight eyeshadows and one highlighter. The more shimmery shades have a denser, thicker consistency that’s firmer and tends to apply best with fingertips or dampened brushes (improves adhesion/spread). For me, I like the creamier, more silicone-heavy shimmers but when they get too heavy, they don’t apply as well with brushes and typical techniques and can sometimes look thick or accentuate lid texture. The mattes in the palette are softer and more yielding compared to mattes in their permanent range.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,MASON,Lipstick,"a medium pink with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. It had good color coverage, though it wasn’t opaque in a single layer and the more emollient consistency didn’t make it that buildable (without getting streaking). The texture was lightweight and lightly creamy, which made it comfortable to apply and to wear. It lasted nicely for four and a half hours on me and was hydrating over time.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,KENDRICK,Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a lightly creamy consistency that glided across my lips with ease but did not slide around when worn. The formula seemed to smooth out most of my lip lines as well. The lipstick stayed on well for five hours and was hydrating while worn.",A
ESSENCE,BE MY COSMOLIGHT,Highlighter,"a pale green with strong, warm undertones and a shifting finish that went from minty green to greenish-gold. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a smooth, soft consistency that was a smidgen dusty in the pan but applied well to bare skin without sheering out too readily (but still diffused nicely along the edges for a seamless finish). It had a more metallic finish, though it could be applied at semi-sheer to medium coverage to get a more natural finish out of it. This shade stayed on well for eight hours on me before fading a bit.",A
CIATE,JEWELLED,Palette,"a new, limited edition peach and berry-themed palette. There were four mattes and five shimmers, though I could have used a bit more contrast out of the mattes (Quartz and Phlox could be further apart in depth). The quality was good across eight of the nine shades with the only miss being Paradise, which was more of a layering/glittery top coat.",B+
DIOR,DEVILISH,Palette,"a limited edition set of five shades that released earlier in the year as part of the fall collection. The formula was decent but certainly not the best I’ve tried, by Dior or otherwise, though I’ll say it was certainly a more interesting color combination. (Personally, that paler pink did not incorporate well with the other four to me due to the undertone of the pink.) It’s still available at some retailers, and as holiday season winds down, I had a moment to finally test this one!",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,LETITIA,Lipstick,"a medium-dark lavender with warmer, pink undertones and a cream finish. The color coverage was nearly opaque in a single layer with a lightly creamy, smooth consistency that had some slip but did not feel too slippery when worn. The downside was in the application, as a bit of product settled into my deeper lip lines and there was very slight streaking along the edges of my lips. It lasted nicely for four and a half hours and was moisturizing to wear.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,KAIA,Lipstick,"a bright, medium purple with warm undertones and a glossy, cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly, but for a luxury-priced lipstick, I would expect it to be perfect in application, though it at least smoothed out a lot of my lip lines. The consistency was lightly creamy with moderate slip that made it comfortable to apply and to wear. It stayed on well for five hours and was hydrating over time.",B+
ESSENCE,BE MY SPACELIGHT,Highlighter,"a pale white base with pink-to-lavender shifting pearl. It had medium, buildable coverage with a more translucent base and very fine pearl; I was surprised that it didn’t appear chalkier when applied as it had some coverage, yet it wasn’t that shimmery either. Frankly, it was a little mystifying with how it translated onto my cheekbones! It had a natural sheen that seemed a bit more noticeable in person than it reads in the photos. The texture was smooth without being too firmly or too softly pressed in the pan, so highlighting and blush brushes picked up product well, distributed them onto my skin easily, and blended the edges beautifully. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.",B+
COLOUR POP,LIT,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette with warm-toned shades across mattes and shimmers. Worth noting, the following shades are “not intended for use in the immediate eye area” per the brand: Mercy and Like. Most of the eyeshadows had good pigmentation, were blendable, and easy enough to use, though it wasn’t quite as good as some of the brand’s previous offerings have been.",A-
COLOUR POP,WIG,Lipstick,"a deep red with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had rich color coverage in a single layer, which applied evenly and spread well across my lips. The consistency was lightweight, smooth, and not too thick or too thin, which made it easier to apply without it overflowing past my lip line nor did it emphasize my lip lines. It was a bit more emollient than some Ultra Satins, but it still had that semi-set dry down. The color was still going strong after eight hours of wear and was neither drying nor hydrating over time.
",A
COLOUR POP,SHE CUTE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark peach with strong, warm orange undertones and a satin finish. It had good pigmentation but wasn’t opaque in one layer. The texture was slightly emollient, which helped it spread easily across my lips, but it gravitate toward my lip lines and did not offer the full coverage application that most of the Ultra Satins offer. It lasted well for five and a half hours and was non-drying.",B
COLOUR POP,WET,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette with six cooler, bluer-based shades and two warm browns. I found that the mattes were a little more powdery than the average shade by the brand, and a couple of the shimmery shades were denser/firmer, so they apply more readily with fingertips/dampened brushes than regular brushes (and not all of ColourPop’s shimmery shades are like that). For the types of shades, it’s actually not bad, as cooler-toned and blues seem to be a bit harder to develop based on what I’ve experienced on the market over the years by various brands (though the cobalt blue not being better was a surprise).",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,GAL,Lipstick,"a soft, medium pink with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had excellent pigmentation that covered my lips evenly in a single layer. The consistency was lightly creamy with some slip but didn’t slide around too readily when worn. There was a smidgen of product that settled into my deeper lip lines initially but did not seem to get progressively worse over time. The color stayed on well for four hours and was moisturizing while worn.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,CINDY,Lipstick,"a bright, light lavender with warm, pink undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that had a lightly creamy, smooth consistency that glided across my lips without dragging. It had a fair amount of slip, and I found it difficult to prevent slight streaking along the edges, and there was a bit of product in my deeper lip lines that did get worse as it wore. It wore well for three and a half hours but was hydrating over time.",B-
COLOUR POP,OOH SHE'S BLUSHING,Blush,"a vivid, medium-dark pink-coral with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had a more flat matte finish when swatched, but it seemed to absorb the natural oils on my face when I applied it to my cheeks (my arm is very dry compared to my face!). The blush had a velvety, smooth consistency that left an indent behind when pressed but didn’t feel wet to the touch–it felt almost clay-like but more malleable. It had opaque pigmentation when applied with fingertips and easily semi-opaque pigmentation when applied with a stippling brush; the latter was the best way to achieve more semi-sheer, buildable coverage but I had to barely pick up any product to do so.

I was able to spread and blend out the product well over bare skin with fingertips and brushes, but for application over a base, a brush was best but there was a bit of lifting. It wore well for 10 hours before fading very slightly.
",B+
GUERLAIN,ELECTRIC LOOK,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette featuring eight eyeshadows and two highlighters for the holidays. The formula can be used wet or dry, but they really offer little insight into the formula behind the palette. The majority of the products were pigmented applied dry, so using them damp usually amplified the finish or made them a little smoother but wasn’t strictly necessary for coverage/application. That being said, the mattes did NOT play well with a dampened brush, so I would advise being careful with using them with a dampened brushes–instead I recommend to pick up product, then gently spray your brush to wet it (or the back of your hand).",B+
COLOUR POP,I SEE YOU,Lipgloss,"a deeper, more orange-leaning gold with flecks of gold and copper sparkle and very fine, golden pearl. The shade itself was described as “sheer” by the brand, but it seemed more semi-sheer to medium to me. The texture was lightweight, lightly creamy without being tacky and comfortable to wear, though there was a bit more product in a few of my lip liens than I expected (usually the formula is rather smoothing). It wore well for three hours and was hydrating over time.",B
COLOUR POP,KUMQUAT,Lipgloss,"a pale, bluish-white with cool undertones and a smattering of silver flecks of sparkle. The brand described it as “translucent,” which was apt, as it was nearly clear on my lips–it seemed to, at best, enhance the cooler pinkness of my natural lip color while adding a bit of milkiness to them. I could see some of the effect of it, particularly along the outer edge of my lips, where there was “coverage” of the translucent variety. The texture was smooth and lightweight without being tacky, and it was easy to spread across my lips. For a pale, milky gloss, it didn’t emphasize my lip lines like I would have expected. It lasted for an hour and a half hour on me from what I could tell (with so little coverage, it is much harder to tell other than by the shine wearing down and physically feeling like there was less gloss on my lips). The formula felt hydrating on me (I wore it back-to-back to get a better sense of that).",B
COLOUR POP,STOP IT,Blush,"a bright, medium orange with warm, balanced (between red and yellow) undertones and a true matte finish. While the finish was totally matte, it did seem to absorb a bit of my skin’s natural oils so it did not appear totally flat when applied to my cheeks. The end result was more of a stained effect, which worked particularly well when applied over bare skin, but application over a base was a little more challenging (doable with more buildable coverage, less-matte foundations). The texture was more velvety and clay-like–drier and less “wet” to the touch compared to more shimmery shades in the formula. It was extremely pigmented, though, and even when I applied the color with a stippling brush, it wasn’t “sheer” and “airbrushed” but rather more medium if I was careful, semi-opaque if I wasn’t. It stayed on well for 10 hours on me before fading very slightly.",B+
NARS,BIG SUR,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, navy blue with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a smooth, lightly creamy texture that was dense without being thick or too stiff to easily pick up with a brush. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading a bit.",A-
NARS,BALI,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, taupe-brown with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. The texture was soft, lightly powdery but blendable and easy to build up coverage from semi-opaque to opaque with two layers. It seemed a little lighter, marginally less pigmented but more buildable/blendable than the original shade I have. This shade stayed on well for seven and a half hours on me.",B
NARS,LAHORE,Eyeshadow,"a soft brown with warm undertones and a satin sheen. It had opaque pigmentation that adhered well to bare skin with smooth, even coverage. The texture was soft, firmer but not too dense or stiff in the pan, so it was easy to work with and blended out nicely along the edges. It wore well for eight hours on me.",A-
NARS,KINGSTON,Eyeshadow,"a pale taupe with neutral-to-cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation with a soft, slightly dusty texture, but it blended out easily and adhered well without sheering out too readily. It lasted stayed on well for seven and a half hours before fading noticeably on me.",B+
NARS,KASHMIR,Eyeshadow,"a soft, golden taupe with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had excellent color payoff with a soft, smooth consistency that was blendable and easy to work with. The eyeshadow seemed to “melt” a little onto my lid after a few minutes giving it a really smooth sheen. It stayed on nicely for eight hours on me.",A
NARS,PYRENEES,Eyeshadow,"a deep gray with cool undertones and a frosted finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation paired with a slightly drier, dustier texture, so it didn’t apply as evenly initially as a lot of other shades. There was also a bit of fallout; it was a shade that needed primer underneath it. On me, it wore well for seven and a half hours.",B-
NARS,BANQUISE,Eyeshadow,"a bright silver with a metallic sheen. It had good pigmentation with a slightly drier, more loosely pressed texture–it seemed like it was going to apply better than it actually did. It went on somewhat patchy and had to be buffed onto my lid to even out. It lasted well for eight hours on me before creasing faintly.",B
NARS,TZARINE,Palette,"a new, permanent duo featuring a soft, shimmery yellow beige and a muted bluish-gray. It’s not my favorite duo–both shades were more medium in coverage and drier/dustier in texture, so they really had to be used over an eyeshadow primer to just make it to workable territory.",C
NARS,THESSALONIQUE,Palette,"a new, permanent duo featuring a pale, shimmery pink and a faded mauve. This particular duo will be best suited for someone who uses eyeshadow primer and prefers softer color and/or more buildable mid-tone shades.",B-
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,PILLOW TALK,Blush,"a soft, peachy brown with soft, warm undertones and a luminous sheen. The center shade is a lighter, more shimmery peach, whereas the outer ring of color is a light-medium, rosy brown with a semi-matte to satin finish. It is most practical to use swirled together, though one can concentrate a bit more to the edge or more in the center to darken or lighten. The texture of both shades was the same: silky, smooth, and finely-milled without being powdery nor too firmly pressed in the pan. They applied evenly and blended out easily on my skin. The color stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me.

Per Charlotte Tilbury PR, this shade will return in January (it’s sold out, has been sold out, and so on).",A
CIATE,BURNT,Palette,"a new, warm-toned palette for the holidays, which may be covered territory in your stash but is a nice option for those who haven’t yet indulged in the right warmer palette. The texture of the formula is soft but not dusty, a little airy but cream-like on the lid–the brand calls it “powder-gel.” All nine shades were easy to work with, and the shimmers had great pigmentation and wear, while the mattes had medium to full pigmentation but were buildable.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,SCOTT,Lipstick,"a medium-dark plum with subtle, warm undertones and a soft, pearly sheen. It had good pigmentation, though it wasn’t opaque in a single layer, but it went on evenly and smoothly across my lips. The lipstick had a lightly creamy consistency that glided on well without tugging but did not slide around while worn. It lasted nicely for five hours and was moisturizing over time.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,CHADWICK,Lipstick,"a slightly muted, medium-dark reddened plum with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied beautifully to my lips in a single stroke–even, streak-free coverage that didn’t emphasize my lip lines. The texture was lightweight, lightly creamy but not slippery to wear, and comfortable over the five hours it stayed on for. The formula felt hydrating over time.",A+
GIVENCHY,HOLIDAY 2018,Palette,"features two miniature-sized version of top selling shades in the Rouge Interdit Satin Lipstick range. The formula is supposed to have “long-lasting wear” with “vibrant, satin color” that has “endless comfort.” They were both comfortable to wear, but it wasn’t a particularly long-wearing formula as the texture was more emollient but thin without that adherence needed for exceptional longevity. They were floral-scented from what I could tell but had no discernible taste.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,LIORA,Lipstick,"a pale pink with cool undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-sheer coverage that applied somewhat unevenly and had streaking along the edges. The texture was lightweight with a lightly creamy, thinner consistency that felt a bit like a balm, so it didn’t drag or tug on my lips during application but I did have issues with color getting into my lip lines. It lasted for three hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",C+
COLOUR POP,FALLING UP,Eyeshadow,"a light, golden peach base with pink and blue glitters over a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation–a little more than it initially appeared in the swatch (more noticeable in the angled swatch)–that applied evenly to bare skin. The consistency was smooth, almost wet to the touch, but it was creamy and lightweight with a nice dry down–quick enough not to settle into creases but allowed me to play and diffuse the edges as it dried down. It lasted nicely for 10 hours with very little fallout over time but no creasing.",A-
COLOUR POP,IRL,Eyeshadow,"a medium, rosy-copper base with gold-to-green shifting sparkle and pearl. It had good color coverage, though it needed a second layer for truly opaque coverage, with a smooth, blendable consistency that wasn’t too creamy or too dry in the pot. The cream eyeshadow applied evenly to bare skin and blended out well along the edges without disrupting the sparkle much (a couple of flecks came loose). It stayed on well for 10 hours with very little fallout over time but no creasing.",A
COLOUR POP,ZZZ,x,"a deep, coppery brown with warm, reddish-copper and copper shimmer over a metallic finish. It had rich color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly across my lid in a single layer. The texture was wetter than most of the Super Shock Shadows but consistent in the feel of the more metallic shades. I really appreciated that it didn’t sheer out too readily so I could get precision and coverage with brushes as well as fingertips. The edges blended out without much effort, even after it had dried down. It wore well for 10 hours without fading or creasing on me.",A
COLOUR POP,DUST2DUST,Lipgloss,"a soft, peachy-orange base with fine pink and peach pearl. It had sheer coverage where the warmer base color tinted my lips a warmer pink with a dusting of fine pink and peach pearl. The consistency was lightweight, smooth, and spreadable with a non-sticky, cushion-like feel that was comfortable and moisturizing on my lips. The lipgloss applied fairly well on my lips but wasn’t as smoothing of my lip lines as other shades in the formula have been for me, and it lasted for two and a half hours on me.",B+
COLOUR POP,HYPNO-TEASE,Lipgloss,"a medium gold with strong, yellow undertones and a sparkling finish. It had semi-sheer coverage with a soft, yellow-ish tint to its base that made my lips appear a bit “coral” in color (but your mileage will vary based on your own natural lip color). The shimmer and sparkle dispersed fairly evenly across my lips, but this particular shade looked less “even” on my lips than other shades in the range, though I found it hard to discern exactly why that was so. The gloss had a smooth, cushion-like texture–creamy and a bit thicker but not heavy or sticky. It lasted well for three hours and was hydrating over time.",B+
WET 'N' WILD,BLOOM TIME,Highlighter,"a soft, pink-peach with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which was easily built up to full coverage with a dab more on top. The consistency was smooth, dense without being thick or stiff in the pan, and blendable on my skin. It had a very metallic finish that was just shy of pore-emphasizing territory on me (which should be read as: if you generally find products emphasize your pores/texture more often than not, this might!). It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before fading slightly.",A
COLOUR POP,SWEET DREAMS,Eyeshadow," a medium pink with warm undertones and flecks of gold and pink sparkle. It had medium coverage that was slightly buildable (to mostly opaque) with two layers, though you’ll want to ensure the first layer is dry before applying the second. The texture felt cool and watery initially, and then it was lightweight, thin, and quick to dry down to a transfer-proof finish on my lid. It lasted well for 10 hours without creasing, fading, or having fallout.",A-
COLOUR POP,NO REST FOR THE VIVID,Eyeshadow,"a brighter, medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and flecks of bluish-pink and silver sparkle. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation with a watery, cooling texture that felt very fluid but was quite thin on my lid. The product dried down fully within 10-15 seconds, which gave me enough time to apply, even out, and diffuse a bit, but it didn’t have such a tight dry down that I wasn’t able to blend near it as it did not flake off when I did so (sometimes cream eyeshadows do this if you muck around with them after they’re set!). The eyeshadow wore nicely for 10 hours without fading, creasing, or having fallout.",A
COLOUR POP,WAVELENGTH,Eyeshadow,"a pale white base with a pink-to-lavender shifting sparkle. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was somewhat buildable but worked best as a layering shade or to brighten an area. The consistency felt similar to other shades in the formula–watery, cool, and thin but fairly easy to apply and quick to set. They’re messier to open up but easier to use than the Super Shock Shadows sometimes. It stayed on well for 10 hours without fallout, fading, or creasing on my lid.",A
COLOUR POP,MORNING LIGHT,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium orange with peach-to-pink shifting pearl paired with a more metallic sheen. It had excellent pigmentation with a lightweight, watery consistency that felt cool to the touch but applied evenly and dried down quickly (but still had enough time to diffuse and soften the edges). It lasted well for 10 hours without fading or creasing on me.",A
BITE BEAUTY,SAGITTARIUS,Lipstick,"an electrifying, neon pink with strong, cool blue undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a smooth, creamy consistency that had a touch of tackiness that helped keep it in place. The lipstick applied without dragging and deposited even color as it glided across my lips. There was a little bit of product that gathered in my deeper lip line, but it wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance. This shade stayed on well for over six hours and was hydrating over time.
",A
MAC,WHO WANTS KANDI,Lipstick,"a light-medium pink with warmer undertones and cooler, iridescent pearl. It had medium color coverage in a single layer, which did not build up much beyond that; it was more in the vein of some of the more pearlescent shades in the launch, but unfortunately, this one wasn’t described as sheer. The consistency was lightweight and thinner and felt just emollient enough not to drag on my lips. It lasted for three and a half hours, but there was a touch of product that settled into my lip lines over time. The formula was neither drying nor hydrating on me from what I could tell.",C+
MAC,SHIMMER AND SPICE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, plummy brown base with flecks of copper, pink, and gold pearl and micro-sparkle. The texture was noticeably gritty and a bit rougher than I’d expect, likely due in part to the thinner consistency that just didn’t suspend the sparkle in enough substance to keep it feeling smooth against my lips. It had medium coverage that did not apply evenly at all. The color stayed on well for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",C-
MAC,SMARTICLE,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark copper with warm, red undertones and a satin finish. The color payoff was opaque in a single layer, while the lipstick had a lightly creamy consistency that was a bit thicker on my lips but did not feel heavy. It had just enough creaminess to glide on without tugging on my lips, but it seemed more prone to separating just slightly along my lip lines, though it wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance. It wore well for five and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",A-
MAC,SMARTY PANTS,Palette,"a new, permanent (per MAC’s website) palette that features eight eyeshadows and one cheek highlighter. The mattes in the palette were nice–softer and more blendable than MAC’s typical formula–but the shimmers were much denser, heavier, and thicker, which made them harder to use with typical eye brushes. The shimmers were more workable with a dampened brush or fingertips, so if those are part of your usual arsenal of techniques/tools, then it might be a better-performing palette for you.",B
COLOUR POP,CHASING RAINBOWS,Palette,"another winning eyeshadow palette from ColourPop. This is a nice mix of color, undertone, and finish that works well as a single palette but paired well with the various products released in the collection (like the Super Shock Shadows and Jelly Much Eyeshadows). I really enjoyed playing and putting together color combinations with this palette and had little difficulty using and working with the shades in it.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,IMARI,Lipstick,"a bright, medium fuchsia pink with cool, bluish undertones and a glossy, cream finish. It had good pigmentation that applied fairly evenly across my lips, but there was faint streaking along the outer area of my lips (just barely visible in the close-up photos and harder to see in person). The lipstick had a creamy, emollient consistency that helped it skate across my lips, but it was thinner and adhered comfortably to my lips without sliding around while I wore it. This shade stayed on nicely for four and a half hours and left a fain stain behind, while the formula was moisturizing over time.
",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,BELLA,Lipstick,"a rich, pinky-red with subtle, cool undertones and a natural sheen. It had good color coverage that applied evenly across my lips and didn’t settle into my lip lines, but it wasn’t quite full coverage. The consistency was emollient with good glide, which made it comfortable to apply and to wear, but it didn’t slide around when worn. It wore well for five hours and was hydrating over time.
",A
MAC,BLACK NIGHT,Lipstick,"a deep black with warm undertones and gold pearl paired with a glossy finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, and for as much slip as it had, it went on more smoothly and evenly than anticipated, though there was plenty of room for improvement. I would recommend applying a lip liner all-over the lips for better coverage, application, and wear. I didn’t experience any feathering or bleeding over the four and a half hours it lasted for, but the product did settle into my lip lines noticeably over time.
",B-
MAC,GLAMOUR OF PUNK,Lipstick,"a soft pink with subtle, cool undertones and a frosted sheen. The shimmer was finer, so it felt rather smooth and has a more pearly effect than overtly sparkly or metallic on my lips. It had sheer color coverage, which was actually how it was described, with a thinner consistency and just enough slip not to drag. It lasted for three hours on me and was non-drying.",B
MAC,RAVE CHIC,Lipstick,"a medium purple with very strong, warm pink undertones and cooler violet pearl. It had semi-sheer, slightly buildable (to about medium) coverage that applied fairly evenly to my lips. Due to the translucency and the more contrasting shimmer, it worked particularly well as a layering shade–it still added a lot of oomph to my lips despite not being opaque. It was, thankfully, described as “sheer,” so it was marketed accurately! The texture was thinner but had enough slip that it glided onto my lips without tugging and was fairly comfortable to wear. It stayed on well for four hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
COLOUR POP,CRYSTAL CASTLE,Eyeshadow,"a soft white with a pink-to-peach shift, though it often looked like a warm, iridescent pink on me with a chalkier base. I found that this finish, which seemed more white-based and had finer shimmer than others in the formula, did not apply as evenly to my skin and looked drier once they set in place. I expected it to brighten more when I placed it on my inner tearduct. It had semi-opaque pigmentation and had a texture that was very wet and “cool” to the touch, but it dried down fairly quickly so I didn’t have to worry about it creasing or moving while it was setting. It lasted for 10 hours without fading or creasing on me.",B
COLOUR POP,WIDE AWAKE,Eyeshadow,"a bright, light-medium gold with subtle, warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin. The texture was watery and cool to the touch, but it dried down quickly without getting into my crease or fine lines but I was still able to diffuse and blend out the edges. It lasted nicely for over 10 hours without creasing or fading on my lid.",A
COLOUR POP,INTO FOCUS,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium, grassy green with subtle, warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. It had good color coverage, though it wasn’t quite opaque, and I found it built up a bit more on the lid than it appeared when I swatched on my arm. The eyeshadow could have gone on a bit more evenly, but it wasn’t noticeable from a normal distance but I could see it in the close-up photos. The consistency was lightweight, watery and cooling as it initially was placed o my lid, but it dried down fairly quickly and stayed in place for over 10 hours without fading or creasing on me.",A-
COLOUR POP,HALLUCINOGENIUS,Eyeshadow,"seemed to have an almost translucent base with blue-to-violet shifting sparkle and finer pearl, though it read a little “copper” in base when I photographed it but didn’t appear that way so much in person. The texture was lightweight, wet to the touch, and felt cool and watery when applied to bare skin. It had medium, buildable coverage but was hard to get fully opaque coverage. It would work well for layering over eyeliner or other eyeshadows to add pop of sparkle and shine. It lasted well for 10 hours without fading or creasing on me.",A-
COLOUR POP,STRATUS UPDATE,Lipgloss,"a light-medium, minty green with subtle, warmer undertones and cooler, green pearl. It had sheer coverage, which was as expected based on the finish, but it could have applied a bit more evenly as it seemed to show slight streaking along the edges, though it didn’t pull into my lip lines. The gloss had a smooth, spreadable consistency that was non-sticky and comfortable to wear for the two and a half hours it stayed on for. I found the formula to be lightly moisturizing while worn.",B
COLOUR POP,DREAMAHOLIC,Lipgloss,"soft lavender with subtle, cool undertones and violet to teal shifting pearl. It had sheer to semi-sheer coverage with a moderate amount of finer shimmer, which helped give it a very smooth, almost creamy, consistency that was easy to spread across my lips and comfortable to wear for the three and a half hours it lasted for. The base color seemed to give my lips more of a tinted appearance. The formula was hydrating and made my lip lines appear less prominent.
",A-
COLOUR POP,DREAM SEQUENCE,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette featuring two glittery highlighters and two more pearly highlighters. All four performed well with pigmentation that was as described (more opaque with fingertip application, more buildable with brushes), were easy to apply and blend out, and stayed on for a solid 10 hours. These shades can also be purchased individually (in pots).
",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,RIVER,Lipstick,"a light-medium, pinky coral with warm undertones and a cream finish. The color payoff was nearly opaque in a single layer, and it applied evenly, though there was slight product that slipped into my deeper lip lines. I didn’t think it was noticeable from a normal viewing distance, just in the close-up photo. The texture was lightweight, creamy with moderate slip, and was comfortable to wear. It stayed on well for four hours and was hydrating over time.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,JORDAN,Lipstick,"a deep, reddened plum with subtle, warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It had very faint pearl that gave it a subtle shimmer but was barely detectable in person (just added more depth, I think). The texture was smooth, lightly creamy, and comfortable to wear as it glided easily across my lips and distributed the product evenly. It had good color coverage, though it wasn’t opaque, and made my lips appear slightly smoother overall. It wore well for five hours and was hydrating over time.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,JESSICA,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark pink with subtle flecks of gold sparkle. It had medium color coverage that applied evenly and sat well on my lips giving them a smoother appearance. The texture was lightly emollient, so it glided across my lips easily but didn’t slide around too much. It stayed on well for four hours and was lightly moisturizing.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,CARDI,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, bluish-purple with flecks of blue, violet, and lighter blue pearl and micro-sparkle. Because it’s semi-sheer in coverage, the purplish-blue color ends up looking more purple than blue against my natural lip color (which is slightly pinky). There’s an unevenness to how it applies, though, that prevents it from being a good layering shade. It had a very lightweight, emollient consistency that was comfortable to apply and to wear. It lasted for three hours on me and lightly hydrating.
",B-
COLOUR POP,OOH LA LA,Palette,"new, presumably limited edition, pink-themed palette that features a few shades but mostly repeats. Worth noting, three shades are of the “Pressed Pigment” variety, which all come with the “not intended for use in the immediate eye area” warning. Those shades are: Big Sugar, Opulent, and Sandbar. The brand new shades are Tickled, Big Sugar, and Caddy (at least, to my knowledge!), which makes six shades repromotes. I liked the palette, but there were a few weaker shades in it that dragged the score down.  I didn’t feel like it was that hard to work with when I applied to my lids, but you’ll likely want to be someone who normally wears eyeshadow primer and doesn’t mind using a dampened brush with the most shimmery shade (Tickled).
",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,SONJA,Lipstick,"a rich, medium pinky-red with cooler undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation–far more pigmented than promised–with a lightly emollient consistency that glided across my lips comfortably. The lipstick sat well on my lips and helped to smooth out my lip lines. It wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,SCARLETT,Lipstick,"a muted, light-medium red with warm undertones and a glossy sheen. It had medium to semi-opaque color coverage–I could see my lip freckle peeking through and tell this shade had some translucency to it. The color applied evenly and easily across my lips, which didn’t emphasize my lip texture or lip lines. It stayed on nicely for four hours and was lightly hydrating. This shade is a repromote, but I found my newest version to be a bit more pigmented, which gave it a redder look on my lips.",A-
PAT MCGRATH,OMI,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark pink with neutral-to-warm undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, which went on evenly and fluidly. It had a smooth, velvety consistency that was lightly creamy but not slippery on my lips, so it adhered well for longer wear. It stayed on well for just shy of the five-hour mark and was neither hydrating nor drying on me. It performed consistently with the regularly-packaged version.",A
PAT MCGRATH,ELSON,Lipstick,"a rich, deep red with strong, cool undertones and a soft sheen. It had good color coverage in a single layer, but I could detect a hint of my lip freckle peeking through (indcating it wasn’t quite full coverage). The lipstick had a lightweight, lightly emollient consistency that felt more emollient than other shades that had a creamier, slightly heavier feel in comparison. For such a rich shade, it was easy to apply, even along the edges, and lasted for over six hours, left a stain behind, and did not feather or bleed along the edges of my lips. The formula felt neither drying nor hydrating on me. It was consistent when compared to the regularly-packaged version, though this seemed to be marginally more comfortable to wear.
",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,ELLIE,Lipstick,"a medium pink with strong,w arm undertones and a frosted finish. It had semi-sheer to medium color payoff in a single layer, which went on evenly and never dragged or tugged on my lips. The texture was ligthweight, lightly creamy, and comfortable to wear while the lipstick sat well on my lips and didn’t exacerbate my lip lines. It lasted for three and a half hours on me and was hydrating over time. This is a repromote and was released previously, though the most recent release seemed a bit warmer and a touch more pigmented.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,AVA,Lipstick,"a soft, peachy beige with warm undertones and a golden pearl. It had medium coverage with a balmy consistency that had noticeable slip and seemed to slide around on my lips a bit, enough to settle into my lip lines. There was also something about how this sat on my lips that it did not seem “even” though it’s hard to say it was patchy or streaky at a glance. It wore well for two hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",C
TOM FORD BEAUTY,CAMILLA,Lipstick,"a soft peach with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It had semi-sheer coverage, as described, that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips. The texture was lightweight, balm-like with moderate slip but felt thinner and did not slide around too much. It stayed on nicely for two and a half hours on me and was moisturizing while worn.
",B+
COLOUR POP,BROWN SUGAR,Palette,"a top notch choice for anyone in the market for warmer, slightly muted neutrals. There’s an earthier tone to the shade selection in the palette that feels a little less like other warm-toned neutral palettes on the market, though for anyone who’s overindulged in the trend, it may be well-traversed territory.",A
PAT MCGRATH,CHRISTY,Lipstick,"a medium pink with strong, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had good color coverage that applied evenly to my lips without dragging or tugging on my lips. The texture had a bit of slip to it, beyond its more velvety, creamy consistency that I expect out of the MatteTrance formula, that led to the color getting into my lip lines. It wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance, and it did not seem to get progressively worse. This shade stayed on well for five hours on me and was lightly hydrating over time. It was fairly consistent with the regularly-packaged version.",A
PAT MCGRATH,FORBIDDEN LOVE,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark red with cool undertones and a satin finish. The lipstick was richly pigmented and had a smooth, lightly creamy consistency that felt velvety and denser but not thick or heavy on my lips. The color was still going strong after seven hours of wear, and it left a stain behind. The formula felt lightly moisturizing while worn. It performed consistently with the regularly-packaged version but was a touch more pigmented (went from 9.5 to 10/10 on pigmentation).
",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,TOMOKO,Lipstick,"a medium pink with warmer undertones and a fine, sprinkling of gold pearl paired with a lightly glossy finish. It had semi-sheer coverage that was buildable to medium-full coverage that applied evenly for the most part with just the tiniest amount of product that I noted in my deeper lip lines in the close-up photos but couldn’t detect in person. The lipstick was lightweight, thinner but not clingy, and emollient enough to glide on easily. It lasted for three hours on me and was lightly hydrating.
",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,HELENA,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, reddened plum with warm undertones and a cream-like finish–a little more luminous than a true “cream” to my eye. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which was more than described for the formula. The color applied evenly across my lips while also smoothing out my lip lines and giving my lips a fuller, plumper appearance. It wore well for four hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.",B+
NATASHA DENONA,FULL METAL BLACK,Eyeshadow,"a deep black with a heavy dose of silver sparkle. The texture was creamy, dense, and thicker, but it spread well across my skin for rich, opaque coverage that was still blendable along the edges. I found the formula significantly creamier and easier to work with than past shades in the same formula, though anyone who wanted to use it as a sheerer wash of color on the lid will find it hard to do so as a little went a long way! It dried down within 30 seconds or so but didn’t feel too slippery as it was drying down, so it didn’t pull into my creases or fine lines but I had time to play with the edges. It wore well for nine hours without fading, creasing, and had just a smidgen of fallout by the end of the day.",A
NATASHA DENONA,FULL METAL BRONZE,Eyeshadow,"a rich, medium-dark brown with strong, warm undertones and flecks of golden bronze glitter/sparkle. The color payoff was fantastic with opaque coverage in a single layer (to the point where a little went a long way). It had a denser, creamier consistency that was thicker than the average powder eyeshadow but did not feel too heavy nor was it greasy/prone to creasing as it dried down. The thickness seemed to work well for ensuring the sparkly bits stayed on the lid rather than traveling elsewhere. There was a touch of fallout if I blended more vigorously over the shade, as that loosened some of the sparkles, but I didn’t have issues just lightly diffusing and moving around the edges as it was drying down. It set within 30 seconds–enough time to play but not enough time for it to sink into fine lines–and stayed on well for nine hours with just a touch of fallout at the end of wear.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,DAYDREAM,Palette,"includes a soft mauve, violet, faded navy blue, and silvery purple. All four shades had shimmer in them, though two of them were more satin-to-pearl rather than metallic. The four shades coordinated well together, and I could see any purple-lover enjoying the color scheme in practice, though I think that the quad absolutely needs to be used with an eyeshadow base and/or used with a dampened brush to get even, opaque coverage out of the shades. Unless you prefer sheerer coverage, then it may work well as-is (but doesn’t live up to the marketing).
",C+
PAT MCGRATH,1995,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark dusty pink with warm undertones and a satin finish. The color payoff was opaque, while the consistency was smooth, velvety, and lightly creamy without feeling too wet or too heavy on my lips but was more “substantial” overall compared to the average lipstick. It wore well for five hours and was neither drying nor hydrating. It was consistent with the permanent, regularly-packaged shade.",A
PAT MCGRATH,FLESH 3,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, reddish-brown with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had rich color coverage that adhered evenly and smoothly to my lips in a fluid stroke. The texture was velvety, lightly creamy but not “wet” in feel, so it didn’t slide around while worn. It stayed on well for six hours and was slightly hydrating overall. It was consistent with the permanent, regularly-packaged shade in color, texture, and wear, though it felt more comfortable by a touch.",A+
PAT MCGRATH,GUINEVERE,Lipstick,"a deep red with subtle, neutral-to-warm undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was intense with opaque coverage achieved in one layer, and it was the type of pigmentation where one didn’t even feel like a full layer was necessary. The consistency felt lightly creamy, almost velvety, as it glided across my lips. It applied evenly and lasted nicely for over six hours and left a faint stain behind. The formula felt moisturizing while worn. The limited edition packaged version was consistent with the regularly-packaged version.",A+
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,STARLIGHT,Palette,"a new, limited edition that consists of four, sparkling shades of “pops.” The brand typically launches quads with one “pop,” and the holiday quads feature all “pops.”

The brand recommended to use the formula with fingertips, if using it dry, for “intense color pay off” or wet to “unleash the intensity and vibrancy of the shades.” I found that they very much needed to be used with a dampened brush or fingertips to get decent coverage and application with minimal fallout. You’ll also want to use an adhesive spray to minimize fallout over time, though the sparkles seemed to be flatter and adhere better to my lids compared to rounder glitter particles.",C+
COLOUR POP,CINNAMON,Lipstick,"a medium brown with strong, warm yellower undertones and a cream finish. The lipstick was richly pigmented with a smooth, creamy texture that glided easily across my lips and yielded even coverage in one stroke. It wore nicely for five hours on me and felt lightly moisturizing while worn.",A+
COLOUR POP,CHOCOLATIER,Lipstick,"a rich, deep brown with warm, red undertones and cream finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a single stroke, which adhered evenly and smoothly across my lips. It had a lightly creamy consistency that applied without tugging or dragging on my lips, and it sat well on my lips without emphasizing my lip lines. The color stayed on well for six hours and was lightly hydrating on me.",A+
PAT MCGRATH,CLUB KISS,Lipstick,"a deep berry with subtle, cool undertones paired with red and purple pearl and larger sparkle. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered my lips evenly with a good dispersion of shimmer as well. It had a lightweight, emollient consistency that glided across my lips ease but did not feel heavy or slippery on, so it adhered well and never feathered or bled past my natural lip line. I could feel that there was a lot of sparkle in the formula when I was applying as well as if I pressed my lips together while I wore the lipstick, which may or may not be a concern for some. The color stayed on well for six hours, while the shininess seemed present for four to four and a half hours of wear (before it started to dull). The formula kept my lips hydrated while I wore it.",A
PAT MCGRATH,FUCHSIA PERFECT,Lipstick,"a bright, medium fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and flecks of gold, pink, and fuchsia pearl/sparkle. It had medium coverage, which was buildable to semi-opaque pigmentation best, but the color applied evenly across my lips, while the sparkle distributed evenly as well. The texture was lightweight, emollient without feeling wet/slippery (though it looked shiny enough to be wet!), which made it comfortable to wear and easy to manipulate. I could feel bits of the sparkle coming through when I applied it from the tube, and also when I pressed my lips together. This shade wore nicely for five and a half hours, left a faint pinkish stain behind, and was hydrating, but worth noting, the shine itself was visible for four and a half of those hours (despite drinking a cup of coffee).",B+
COLOUR POP,BUTTER,Lipstick,"a medium peach with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had a smooth, creamy consistency that felt a little thicker than the average Lux lipstick, and there was a bit of extra slip, too. There was a touch of product that sat in my deeper lip lines, though it wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance. It had rich, opaque color payoff in a single stroke that went on evenly. This shade stayed on well for four and a half hours and was felt lightly moisturizing.
",A
COLOUR POP,BRICK,Lipstick,"a medium-dark plum with strong, warm undertones and a cream finish. The pigmentation was fantastic with rich, even color coverage in a single layer. The lipstick was creamy with moderate slip but didn’t feel slippery on my lips, and there was a hint of tackiness that kept it in place. It wore well for five and a half hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A
FENTY BEAUTY,HOLIDAY 2018,Palette,"contains 12 miniature-sized Match Stix with five shades from the permanent line and seven new shades. I reached out to the brand multiple times trying to find out whether the new shades were going to be added to the permanent range in the future or if they were limited edition and exclusive to the set, but I wasn’t able to get an answer. The packaging for the set was similar to the Mattemoiselle 10/10 set (which I was able to get confirmation about; those new shades will be added in the future) and not the limited edition, holiday sets, so here’s hoping they will be added in the future. The formula was consistent with the permanent range–medium to full coverage, fairly blendable, a drier, more powder-like finish on the skin. Some shades were drier, sheerer, or harder to blend out, which was how the permanent range was for me as well.

Each Match Stix contains 0.10 oz. of product, and a full-sized Match Stix contains 0.25 oz. and retails for $25.00 or $100.00 per ounce, which gives the set a total value of $120. It includes a roll-up case that they can be stored in. Worth nothing, the miniature Match Stix are not magnetic, whereas the full-sized ones click together for easy hunting in one’s bag (per the brand at launch).",B
COLOUR POP,BLOWZY,Lipgloss,"a medium, pinky-coral with flecks of gold sparkle. It had sheer coverage–just as described–that spread evenly and smoothly across my lips with a high-shine finish and a dusting of sparkle. The gloss had a lightweight, smooth, lightly creamy texture that wasn’t sticky and smoothed out my lip lines. This shade lasted for two and a half hours but was moisturizing while worn.",A
COLOUR POP,DUMPLING,Lipgloss,"a medium, peachy coral with warm undertones and a creamy finish. Surprisingly, this was described as a “sheer peach,” though it was more semi-opaque in coverage. I could dab it on and spread the color out with my lips or fingertip to get sheer coverage, but if I used the same amount as other Ultra Glossy Lips, it was definitely not sheer. The texture was smooth, lightweight, and non-sticky, which made it comfortable to wear and easy to spread. There was some product that gathered in my lip lines, and it did not go on as evenly as desired (slight streaking along the edges, too). It wore well for three hours and was hydrating over time.",C
FENTY BEAUTY,FROST MONEY,Palette,"a limited edition trio of silver, blue, and deep purple crayons that are designed to be used on eyes and lips, though they disappointed no matter where they were used. They were least awful on my lash line, but they were painful and tragic on my lids and lips. Be sure to click “formula overview” on any of the below reviews or visit my Frost Bunny review for more a in-depth look at just how poorly this formula worked.
",F
BiTE BEAUTY,SCORPIO,Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange-red with strong, warm red undertones and a satin finish. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, lightly creamy texture that had a touch of tackiness but never felt heavy or too thick. The consistency had just enough slip to help it glide across my lips evenly while ensuring the product adhered well for longer wear, but it wasn’t quite as smoothing as other Bite shades have been for me. This shade stayed on well for six and a half hours and was moisturizing while worn.",A
PAT MCGRATH,BLITZ GOLD,Lipstick,"a bright, medium gold with strong, warm yellow undertones and a glittering, sparkling finish. It seemed to have a mix of larger sparkle and micro-glitter with a translucent base, so it had more medium coverage that was buildable to semi-opaque coverage. The base was rather emollient, and I found that as I tried to build up color, more product would pull into my lip lines and didn’t go on as evenly as I would have liked, though it wasn’t noticeable in person as there was so much shine ad and sparkle. The texture was noticeably glittery, so while it didn’t tug on my lips, I could feel the edges of the glitter/sparkle as I applied it and certainly could feel/tell it was an overtly glittery product on my lips while worn. It wore well for five hours and was hydrating while worn.
",B-
PAT MCGRATH,NUDE ROMANTIQUE,Lipstick,"a soft, coral-red with warm undertones and multi-colored pearl and larger sparkle. This was one of the least sparkly shades in the range; it had more of a soft, pearlescent sheen than overtly glittery finish. It felt a bit smoother and creamier as well with less noticeable texture coming through from the sparkle/glittery bits. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was slightly buildable, but while the color applied evenly, but there was a touch of product that gathered in my lip lines the more I tried to build up coverage. This shade stayed on well for four and a half hours and was moisturizing while worn.",B+
PAT MCGRATH,CYBER ORCHID,Lipstick,"a deep fuchsia pink with cool undertones and a mix of fuchsia and lighter pink sparkle and finer pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips in a fluid motion. The lipstick was lightweight with creaminess and an emollient feel, but it didn’t feel slippery or heavy on, so I didn’t feel like it moved around too much during wear. I could just barely feel the texture of having all that sparkle in the formula when I applied it to my lips, and if I pressed my lips together firmly, I could tell there were shimmers/fine sparkles on my lips. It never felt gritty or rough to me, but I knew I had larger shimmer/sparkle on my lips, and I didn’t have any issues with the glitters/sparkles migrating to parts unknown. This shade had better application with decent coverage, and it’s real “downside” was that it didn’t live up to the claim of full coverage. It did wear nicely for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A-
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,SUPERSONIC GIRL,Palette,"a new, limited edition quad that contains four, sparkling shades that sold out very quickly across the internet retailers. There are moments where I feel like I live and breathe all things beauty and then there will be products, like this one, that sell out and leave me confused as to why. In the brand’s eyeshadow quads, one shade is the “pop” color, which is usually a sparkly shade with a more emollient, almost “wet” texture, and this palette contains all “pops.” For most, I suspect this is a complementary palette–glittery, sparkly accents to pair with one of many palettes out on the market (including Stars in Your Eyes, which I felt went with this palette).

The brand recommended to use the formula with fingertips, if using it dry, for “intense color pay off” or wet to “unleash the intensity and vibrancy of the shades.” I found that they very much needed to be used with a dampened brush or fingertips to get decent coverage and application with minimal fallout. You’ll also want to use an adhesive spray to minimize fallout over time, though the sparkles seemed to be flatter and adhere better to my lids compared to rounder glitter particles.",B-
COLOUR POP,NUT,Eyeliner,"a medium copper with warm, reddish undertones and a bright, golden sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which applied fairly evenly. I found it applied most evenly when I used a synthetic, angled liner brush or a thin, brush-style liner brush but seemed to have a bit more slip in its consistency that it tended to sheer out more readily if I used a larger brush (like a flat, synthetic brush). The latter is more of a note than anything to do with the rating, as it is marketed as an eyeliner to be used with an angled brush, though I’ve found most ColourPop’s cream eyeliners work well as eyeshadow bases, too. The color stayed on well for nine hours before fading slightly.",A
COLOUR POP,RUM,Eyeliner,"a deep bronze with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had opaque pigmentation in a single layer that applied evenly and smoothly across my skin with both a flat, synthetic brush (more for applying it as an eyeshhadow or base) as well as a synthetic, angled liner brush. The consistency was smooth, emollient without being too wet or slippery, and dried down fast enough not to get into fine lines but still had time to play to smudge or soften the edge. It wore well for nine hours before fading a bit on my lower lash line.",A+
COLOUR POP,STEW,Eyeliner,"a medium-dark brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. I feel like we often see deep and black-brown hues for eyeliner, so this more mid-tone brown is interesting to see. It had rich color coverage that applied evenly and fluidly in a single stroke using a synthetic, angled liner brush. The gel eyeliner had a smooth, lightly emollient consistency that skated across my skin without sheering out too readily. It dried down quickly but had enough time to play that I could gently smudge or soften edges if desired. I didn’t notice any fading or wear down of this shade after 10 hours of wear.",A+
FENTY BEAUTY,MATTEMOISELLE 10/10,Palette,"a new, limited edition set for the holiday season that is supposed to feature 10 upcoming shades in the Mattemoiselle range, so sometime in the future, these will release individually in the permanent range (I don’t have a date). They were fairly consistent with the range–pigmented, creamy, and longer-wearing with mostly non-drying to lightly hydrating formulas. A full-sized lipstick retails for $18 a pop, so the set has a value of $180, which may be worth it for someone who wears a spectrum of shades and likes satin finishes.",A-
DIOR,HOLIDAY 2018,Palette,"a limited edition, sold out mini set that was exclusive to Sephora. The upside for yours truly is that the shades included are part of the permanent range so not all is lost, at least in terms of swatches and testing. The formula is better than it appears in the ratings because this formula comes with an overzealous wear-time claim of 16 hours when most shades last between four and six hours. I wish the lipsticks were squatter as they are narrower, and in the mini format, they are more fragile; I managed not to break any (I was careful), but I could see it happening quite easily.",C+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,VIRGIN ORCHID,Palette,"a new, rosy/mauve quad featuring a pinkish-white, mid-tone pink, light mauve, and deeper plum. The formula on this is more comparable to Nude Dip, though I found it a bit more compact/denser (but definitely not in line with most of the previously-released Eye Quads). I didn’t see anything about it wet/dry but often find this type of formula can be used that way, so the swatches reflect that but testing and ratings are done based off of dry application and wear. The four shades came together fairly well, but I did find that the inclusion of three lighter shades made them run together a little more than ideal (for versatility across skin tones).",B+
MAC,CAKETOP,Lipgloss,"a medium copper with stronger, warm orange undertones as a base with flecks of sparkles that shifted from mid-tone pink to deeper, copper-red. It seemed to have a rather sheer, more translucent base color (looked almost clear when I spread the gloss out on my skin) with a fair amount of larger, grittier sparkle/micro-glitter. Though Lipglass is a thicker formula and has more density, which often helps disguise the texture of shimmer/sparkle, I felt that this ran a bit thinner and I could feel some of the glitter coming through. It applied somewhat evenly, but there was a bit of product that gathered in my lip lines and the shimmer could have dispersed better. This shade lasted well for four hours and was lightly hydrating.",C+
MAC,ICE ORCHID,Lipgloss,"a soft pink with warm undertones and fine pearl along with multi-colored micro-sparkle. It had a semi-sheer base with more semi-opaque “coverage” in the form of shimmer/sparkle. I found that it seemed to enhance the natural pink tones of my lip color, which helped keep the gloss looking even. The texture was smooth, moderately sticky, but I found it comfortable to wear, and it was flattering on as it smoothed out my lip lines. It stayed on nicely for four hours on me and was hydrating over time. I really wish MAC would indicate coverage levels on their Lipglasses, as the formula is listed as “high coverage,” but they put out so many sheer to semi-sheer shades that it’s hard to imagine that’s not on purpose.",B+
MAC,ROSEBUDDY,Lipgloss,"a deep plum with warm undertones and multi-colored pearl. It had medium pigmentation in a single layer, which applied fairly evenly but pulled into my lip lines noticeably. The gloss had a smooth, light-medium thick consistency that was moderately tacky but not glue-like. This shade stayed on well for five hours and was moisturizing over time.
",B-
NATASHA DENONA,CRANBERRY,Palette,"a new holiday palette that features three shimmery shades and two mattes. The mattes are an interesting texture–they are the “Cream Powder” formula, and I could see it being a texture some enjoy and others don’t. They’re more cream than powder, but they’re a drier cream; they won’t really indent noticeably if the surface is pushed down, but they look like a more silicone-heavy cream eyeshadow applies. I found Sakura easier to work with than Blossom, but both shades were lighter (though more opaque in terms of coverage) and needed to built up to get closer to the color depth seen in the respective pan.",A-
PAT MCGRATH,REBEL RED,Lipstick,"a bright, pinky-red with cool undertones and a sparkling, shiny finish. It had a mix of brighter, fuchsia sparkle and more tone-on-tone ruby red sparkle. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly, though it seemed a little splotchy along my lower inner lip area. The consistency was as smooth as I’d expect for a glittery lipstick, but I could feel some of the sparkle/glitter in it as I applied as well as when I wore the color. What was most impressive with the formula was how shiny it was and how long that shine stayed on for as often the shine wears down, but it was both sparkling and shiny with a “wet” look, despite not being slippery on. It wore well for almost six hours, barely left a reddish stain behind, and was moisturizing while worn.",A-
PAT MCGRATH,FLESH FATALE,Lipstick,"a muted, reddish-copper with warm undertones and gold and pink pearl and larger sparkle. It had good pigmentation with a smooth, lightly emollient texture that glided across my lips fluidly without tugging. I wouldn’t describe it as “full coverage,” and the formula has enough creaminess to it that over-applying can result in product getting into lip lines. This shade had noticeable shimmer and sparkle, but it wasn’t the most sparkly shade in the range (which may or may not be your cup of tea). I found it had lots of shine that was visibly apparent for hours (including through drinking a cup of tea) and only started to wear down at the four-hour mark (and it lasted for about five hours on me). The formula felt comfortable and was hydrating to wear.",A-
PAT MCGRATH,SUBLIMINAL DARK STAR,Palette,"a new, limited edition set of six shades with two more matte finishes and four shimmery shades. It’s an interesting mix of warmer and cooler shades, and though mixing undertones can sometimes be difficult, I found that these paired well together. I imagine that this will be best as a complementary palette to one’s stash rather than the most cohesive/versatile standalone palette. While I see the tonal differences between Entice and Enraptured, I wish one of them was something different – perhaps in the vein of VR Fire Opal, which might give it a gold-green flash to pop against the shades in this palette.",A
MAC,SCARCELY SEEN,Lipgloss,"a pale beige with warm, peachy undertones and fine pearl and shimmer. It had semi-sheer color coverage–sheer enough that my natural lip color came through noticeably but milky enough to noticeably cover my lip freckle. The texture was lightweight, light-medium in thickness, and moderately tacky. There was a bit of color that gathered in my lip lines, but it was barely noticeable in person and only occurred in my deeper lip lines. I was impressed by the evenness of the milky color, though, as I find these types of shades (in this coverage level) often are streaky. It lasted nicely for three and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.
",B
NARS,MOJAVE,Palette,"a new set of neutrals with a metallic taupe, deep brown, deep gold, and soft, satiny beige. The four shades would work well for a more subdued–but shimmery–neutral look with slight warmth but doesn’t lean orange. I think those who prefer more buildable pigmentation and/or use an eyeshadow primer will find this easy to work with.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,LUKAS,Lipstick,"a rich, deep pink-coral with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had opaque pigmentation that applied evenly across my lips without tugging or dragging, but I felt like it separated a bit along my lip lines and wasn’t the most flattering finish on my lips (particularly compared to some Tom Ford’s other shades). The consistency was lightweight, creamy without being too emollient, and was comfortable to apply and to wear. It stayed on well for five hours and was hydrating over time.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,JAGGER,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark orange-red with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had a lightly creamy, almost velvety as it didn’t feel as emollient as a typical lipstick I(more of the “matte” coming through), and it glided across my lips with ease. It had opaque pigmentation that applied evenly on my lips and didn’t emphasize my lip lines. The color lasted well for five and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,ARMIE,Lipstick,"a deep red with subtle, cool undertones and a natural sheen. It had good color coverage, though my lip freckle peeked through so it wasn’t full coverage. The consistency was lightweight, almost thin but not clingy or difficult to work with, and glided across my lips and yielded even, smooth application. It wore nicely for six hours, left a faint stain behind, and was lightly hydrating.",A
WET 'N' WILD,HOLLY GOLD-HEAD,Highlighter,"a medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a frosted sheen. It had excellent pigmentation with a smooth, slightly denser consistency that applied evenly to my cheeks and blended out with little effort. There was a noticeable sheen but wasn’t quite to the level of a truly metallic finish. The highlighter was dense enough not to have any excess product kicked up in the pan, but I had no trouble picking up product using a tapered highlighting brush. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,LUNA,Highlighter,"a light-medium, peachy gold with strong, warm undertones and a luminous finish. The finish was glowing without being frosted or metallic, yet it was a few notches above subtle, so it ended up being a nice happy medium between subtle and intense that we don’t see quite as frequently (but the hue itself has been done often–you could easily dust translucent powder over a more intense highlighter to tamp down some of the shine/shimmer). The consistency was thinner, almost papery with the way it felt a smidgen drier to the touch, but it picked up well with a tapered highlighting brush and applied evenly to bare skin. I had no trouble diffusing the edges on my skin, and it did not appear dry or dusty applied. The highlighter stayed on well for seven and a half hours on me before fading slightly.",A-
HUDA BEAUTY,NEW NUDES,Palette,"a solid offering for those who like their pinks and berries with pops of shimmer. I think that the mattes are blendable and easy to work with, even though some of them have more buildable coverage (not “highly-pigmented” as described), and they were very functional. I did long for a deeper, richer, more contrasting matte shade to get more depth and definition out of the color story. While the glitter shades worked better than anticipated, I think if they had included one deeper matte and another shimmer, it would be a more functional, higher quality palette overall.

As an aside, I’m not reviewing/rating the concealer base as it doesn’t quite align with the color rating system used on the palette and the rest of the shades, so I’ll leave my brief thoughts here: it’s a sheerer, thinner concealer with a more emollient base in a pale, yellowish beige shade. It worked decently with the eyeshadows in the palette, but depending on your need for coverage, coloring, and so forth, it may be too sheer and/or too light to work well. I would have rather the brand include another eyeshadow and include a concealer sample with the palette (like how some companies include a travel-sized eyeshadow primer).",B+
WET 'N' WILD,BABY IT'S ROSE-GOLD OUTSIDE,Highlighter,"a medium, reddish-copper with warm undertones and a natural sheen. This one oddly lost a lot of its shimmer/shine on my skin when blended out–there was a subtle sheen in person that was lost in photos. It added subtle color on my complexion, so it ended up being less of a highlighter and more of a blush/bronzer due to the lower shimmer–but for someone who wants a more subtle sheen, it might work out. The consistency was smooth to the touch but a bit denser overall. It had good color coverage that was buildable from semi-opaque to opaque coverage on my cheeks as it took a bit more effort to dislodge product using a tapered highlighting brush. For higher coverage, I recommend using a dense blush or bronzer brush. It lasted well for seven and a half hours on me.",B
COLOUR POP,ROY G BIV,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark pink with subtle, warmer undertones and flecks of gold sparkle and softer micro-sparkle. The consistency was very emollient and had more slip than anticipated, so it was a bit harder to apply without sheering out a bit when blending it out. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that did not build up well, but it had enough sparkles to distract from the lesser coverage for those who aren’t die-hard for opacity. It lasted well for 10 hours without fading or creasing and had just a touch of fallout over time.",B-
COLOUR POP,MILKY WAY,Eyeshadow,"an intense, bright fuchsia pink with cool undertones and cooler blue and fuchsia sparkle. The color payoff was fantastic with rich, opaque pigmentation delivered in one stroke. The texture was smooth, spongy, and lightly emollient without being prone to sheering out. It blended out well along the edges and still retained its vibrancy as it dried down. This shade stayed on well for 10 hours without fading or creasing.",A+
COLOUR POP,REM,Eyeshadow,"a soft, periwinkle blue with larger silver glitter over a sparkling, metallic base. It had medium coverage that was somewhat buildable, but it was better used as a brightening/layering shade than a standalone shade. There was enough sparkle in it that twinkled in person that the sheerness wasn’t as noticeable to the eye. The consistency was spongy, smooth, and blendable, though it did not seem quite as emollient as I would have expected based on the finish (didn’t seem to impact the performance any). It wore well for 10 hours without fading or creasing.
",B+
COLOUR POP,STARBURST,Lipgloss,"a clear base with multi-colored sparkle. It had more of a glittery finish, but the creamy, smooth texture kept it feeling plush and cushiony on my lips. It was intended to be clear, so it was, as anticipated, sheer with a light-medium level of “coverage” from the sparkle. If you’re looking for a sparkly, clear gloss, this is a nice one. The glossy spread the glitter evenly across my lips and smoothed out my lip lines. It wore well for three hours and was moisturizing while worn.",A
COLOUR POP,ROUND MIDIGHT,Lipgloss,"a pale, milky pink base with barely-there pink micro-shimmer. It really looked more like a cream-like finish on my lips, and it had the effect of lightening my natural lip color. It had sheer coverage, as described, and went on fairly evenly with just a touch of product getting into my lip lines (which is impressive given the lightness of the hue). The gloss had a lightweight, non-sticky consistency that was plush and comfortable to wear. This shade stayed on well for two hours and was hydrating over time.",B
COLOUR POP,PAPER MOON,Lipgloss,"a medium pink with warmer undertones and gold sparkle. It had semi-sheer color coverage with a fair amount of sparkle and micro-glitter. The texture was lightweight, smooth, and cushion-like as it felt plusher and a bit creamy, though it wasn’t heavy or sticky on my lips. The pearl and glitter spread well across my lips for even dispersion. It lasted well for three hours and was moisturizing over time.
",A-
WET 'N' WILD,AWESOME BLOSSOM,Highlighter,"a rich copper with warmer undertones and a golden, metallic sheen. It had rich color payoff in a single layer, though the denser consistency made it easier to just use a lighter hand to pick up less product for a more buildable application. The consistency felt a touch drier to the touch, but it applied evenly and blended out without too much effort (but not quite as nicely as some of the best shades in the formula). It wore well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.
",B+
MAC,TUDOR ROSE,Lipgloss,"a rich fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and flecks of blue and pink sparkle. It had medium color coverage in a single layer, which drenched my lips in a noticeable pop of color and plenty of sparkle/shimmer, but it had a translucency that enabled the natural lip color to come through–looked like stained glass. The texture was smooth, spreadable, and moderately tacky, though comfortable to wear and hydrating over time. It wore well for five hours on me.",A
MAC,BOTH CHEEKS,Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium-dark magenta with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage that applied evenly, but something was off about the texture was it slipped into my lip lines noticeably, which gave my lips a more textured look. The consistency was lightweight with moderate slip, but it didn’t feel too creamy yet it pulled away along my lip lines. The color stayed on well for six hours, left a stain behind, and was a bit drying after five hours of wear.",B
MAC,STRAIGHT FIRE,Lipstick,"a deep red with subtle, cool undertones and a barely-there, metallic sheen. The color payoff was opaque in a single layer, though the texture was firmer and denser, so there was some tugging on my lips when I tried to apply it in a fluid stroke. I found the best way to apply this was in shorter strokes across my lips, which was more comfortable and still conducive to full coverage, even application. It wore well for five and a half hours but was a touch on the drying side over time.",B+
PAT MCGRATH,SUBLIME BRONZE TEMPTATION,Palette,"a new, limited edition six-pan palette that features a mix of neutrals with a pop of emerald green. Of the holiday palettes released, this was one of the more cohesive ones as it had a mix of mattes and shimmers, lights and darks, so I could see it working well for a myriad of looks and preferences.",A
NARS,RIOT,Palette,"the boldest of the Velvet Matte Lip Pencil Sets this year with three reds shades and one berry hue to enjoy. All four shades had semi-opaque to opaque pigmentation, four to six hour wear, and were fairly easy to apply, though they could have go on a bit more evenly overall. That being said, from a normal viewing distance, they did not look uneven, so we are talking minor unevenness.

The set contains four full-sized Velvet Matte Lip Pencils, in all new shades, giving it a total value of $108. My information had it exclusively available at NARS, but it is also on Nordstrom, Barneys, and Saks (specialty retailers).",A-
MAC,A LITTLE MOONLIGHT,Eyeliner,"a semi-sheer black base with larger silver sparkle and larger glitter. It had some larger particles to it, though they seemed to adhere well when applied on my lower lash line with the only fallout occurring if I attempted to blend/diffuse it after it had dried down. This worked best layered over other, deeper, more blackened eyeliners (like a true black) as the base color was still prominent enough that it made other shades look uneven if applied over light and mid-tone bases. It lasted well for nine hours on me (I tested it alone for wear).
",B
MAC,STATUESQUE,Eyeliner,"a bright, sparkling silver with fine pearl and larger sparkle. It had semi-sheer coverage that spread fairly evenly in a single, fluid stroke, but it was more watery in texture and was hard to control for a consistent thickness in the line, though. As a top coat, it was sufficient as the base seemed translucent and there was a good amount of shimmer/sparkle that translated when it was layered over other eyeliners. It dried down quickly and wore well for nine hours without fallout.",B+
MAC,HOLIDAY TIME,Eyeliner,"a sparkling, golden peach with lots of gold sparkle and pearl. It had a very sheer base, so it worked well for layering over all sorts of types of products from other liquid eyeliners to pencil eyeliners to eyeshadow. It had a watery consistency that made it hard to control it in a fluid stroke, but it dispersed the shimmer/sparkle fairly evenly overall. Once applied, it dried down quickly and stayed in place well for nine hours without fallout.",B+
MAC,MIDNIGHT TOAST,Eyeliner,"a blackened navy blue base with fine navy blue and mid-tone blue pearl. This one had a shinier, more metallic finish and the most coverage out of the four shades–nearly semi-opaque. It didn’t seem quite was watery, though it was thin and very fluid (again, a bit too fluid as it was harder to control). It applied best over other deep shades (like black eyeliner) to avoid any visible unevenness. It dried down quickly and lasted well for 10 hours without thinning, fading, or flaking.",B+
PAT MCGRATH,SUBVERSIVE METALMORPHOSIS,Palette,"a new, limited edition six-pan palette that includes four new shades and two repeated from last year’s limited edition Decadence palette. I think that Pat McGrath’s metallic eyeshadow formula may be one of the best on the market, if not the best, that I have tried myself. It is incredibly luxe; finely-milled, creamy without being heavy or thick, intensely pigmented but just as easily blended out for diffused edges. The eyeshadows retain such a high-shine finish without having to apply them with fingertips or a dampened brush; they are that rich and bright applied with a dry brush. The metallics just melt on my lids giving them a glow, and all that creaminess and shine doesn’t come with shorter wear or a specific application method.",A
MAC,FALL IN LOVE,Lipstick,"a deep fuchsia with warmer undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had medium pigmentation that did not apply evenly and emphasized the texture of my lips. The lipstick had a smooth, velvety consistency with some slip but ran thinner so it didn’t slide around while worn. There was nothing about how it felt that indicated why it applied so poorly to my lips, especially as the deeper shades and shades prior and after this that I applied looked significantly better on. This shade stayed on well for four and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating, but it did seem to get noticeably patchier over time.",C
MAC,LASTING PASSION,Lipstick,"a bright red with neutral-to-cool undertones and a satin finish. It had good color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips without gathering in my lip lines. I actually felt that this shade smoothed out my lip texture, as opposed to emphasizing it like a lot of the other shades in the formula did (and blurring lip lines was something it was supposed to do!). The texture was lightweight, thin but velvety enough to glide on without dragging, and was comfortable to wear. It lasted for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.
",A
MAC,A WINK OF PINK,Lipstick,"a medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and warmer gold and pink pearl. It had medium color coverage that was somewhat buildable (to semi-opaque coverage) but would work best for someone who prefers less coverage in their lipsticks. It had a lightweight, emollient texture that glided easily across my lips but did not slide around once on, as it was thinner and a bit “clingy” in a way (but not in an uncomfortable way). It lasted well for three and a half hours on me and was lightly hydrating.
",B
MAC,AT LEISURE,Lipstick,"a soft, medium copper with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good pigmentation, though it wasn’t fully opaque in a single layer. The texture felt smooth, lightly creamy but was thin and didn’t have any “wet” feel to it, so it glided easily across my lips but didn’t move around while worn. The color went on evenly and stayed on well for four and a half hours, while the formula was neither drying nor hydrating on me.
",A-
MAC,BABETOWN,Lipstick,"a soft, light-medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that adhered evenly onto my lips with just a smidgen of product that gathered in my deeper lip lines, but it wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The lipstick had a smooth, lightly creamy texture with a touch of tackiness that helped it remain creamy on but not be prone to sliding around. It wore well for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",B+
TOO FACED,THE SWEET SMELL OF CHRISTMAS,Palette,"four limited edition, exclusive shades of liquid lipstick. Each shade has its own scent (coordinated with its name) and a slightly sweet taste.",A-
GUERLAIN ,ELECTRIC PEARL,Highlighter,"a soft, translucent peach with fine copper micro-sparkles and finer, champagne pearl. It’s the newest limited edition release in the Meteorites Pearls range, and this holiday’s edition is supposed to “create a halo of radiance” with a “subtle harmony of gold and copper pearls” that “counter a dull complexion” while the “champagne and white pearls reflect the light.” It is a more sparkly version in Meteorites, so if seeing visible sparkle on your skin is a deal-breaker, you’ll want to give this a miss. I could see if working as a subtle highlighter on cheeks if desired, and when packed on enough, I could get the faintest hint of color on my skin.

As a finishing powder, it added subtle luminosity all-over my face without making me look powdery, and it did not change my skin tone or coloring. I do find the effect is subtle enough that it is more noticeable in person and in harsher light (studio lighting is more forgiving, so the finishing powder doesn’t do as much lifting). The Meteorite Pearls didn’t impact the longevity of my base in either direction. I felt like I saw the light being reflected and some brightening of my overall complexion, but it was a subtle effect as usual.

I noticed that this year’s edition did not include any pouf or foam round on top the pearls, so mine arrived rather dusty. They are floral-scented.",A-
GUERLAIN ,ELECTRIC LIGHT,Highlighter,"a light-medium gold with strong, warm undertones and a luminous sheen. This was more like a highlighter than a bronzer, though very fair skin tones may find it to be a light bronzer. The pigmentation was mostly opaque and buildable to full coverage with a second layer. It had a firmer, smooth consistency that wasn’t as finely-milled as I’d expect from the brand’s past powder releases, so it needed a slightly heavier hand to pick up product with a brush. The powder applied evenly to bare skin and blended out easily, though, and it didn’t emphasize my skin’s natural texture. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.

Like most Guerlain Terracotta products, it is heavily scented with floral (violet, per the brand) notes–when I say heavily scented, I mean leaving it open perfumes a room, and it is noticeable applied.",B+
FENTY BEAUTY,UNINVITED,Lipstick,"a deep black with neutral-to-cool undertones and a mostly satin finish. It seemed to have more of a vinyl-matte finish where it had a bit of shine but wasn’t actually shimmery or glossy. I found the texture was more emollient, almost too oily but very thin, that it was harder to control this shade and made it more prone to sheering out on my lips and separating along my lip lines. It definitely needed a second coat, after the first layer had finished drying down, for fully opaque coverage. It wore well for six hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",C
FENTY BEAUTY,UNVEIL,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark brown with subtle, warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had good color payoff in a single layer, though it seemed a touch shy of truly opaque coverage (particularly noticeable along the center of my mouth and toward the inner lip area). It had a smooth, fluid consistency that was thin and emollient but not too slippery that it sheered out. I recommend wiping a bit of product off on the edge of the opening if you’re unfamiliar with the formula, as it is so fluid and smooth that it can be easy to over-apply product or get beyond the edges of the lip line. It stayed on well for eight hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.
",B+
GUERLAIN ,#91,Lipstick,"a slightly muted, medium red with subtle, cool undertones and fine, ruby red pearl paired with a naturally shiny finish. It had good pigmentation with a smooth, lightly creamy texture that had noticeable slip when being applied but it didn’t slide around when worn. The formula sat well on my lips and smoothed out my lip lines and did not settle into them over time. It wore well for five and a half hours and was nicely hydrating while worn.",A
GUERLAIN ,#92,Lipstick," a medium, peachy beige with warm undertones and a fine, pearly sheen. It had semi-sheer color coverage that applied fairly evenly, but there was a bit of product that crept into my deeper lip lines. The consistency was lightweight, lightly emollient but a little more slippery compared to other shades in the Rouge G. The color stayed on nicely for four hours and was moisturizing over time.",B
GUERLAIN ,#93,Lipstick,"a medium-dark copper with warm, orange undertones and fine, lighter orange and copper pearl paired with a luminous finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly in a fluid stroke, but it lacked some of the emollient quality that I expect of the Rouge G range and didn’t smooth out my lip lines as much as other shades have. The texture was lightweight, thin but not clingy, and was lightly creamy so it did not tug on my lips during application. This shade lasted well for five hours and was hydrating while worn.",B+
MAC,BEST OF ME,Lipstick,"a pale beige with subtle,w arm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered my lips somewhat evenly, but it did not adhere well to the inner area of my lips. The color sank into my lip lines noticeably within a minute of application, and this worsened over the two and a half hours the color stayed on for. It had a smooth, slightly emollient consistency that never dragged on my lips, but I just couldn’t get this one to look even and smooth on my lips, despite having exfoliated prior to applying it. The formula was neither drying nor hydrating over time.",C-
MAC,INFLUENTIALLY IT,Lipstick,"a medium, pinky beige with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage that adhered fairly evenly to my lips in a single layer, though it wasn’t buildable due the emollient texture (just seemed to move the color around more and cause it to sink into my lip lines more noticeably if I put on more product). The lipstick had a lightweight, thin consistency that didn’t cling or feel uncomfortable, though it did gather into my lip lines and had a tendency to emphasize any texture on my lips. The color stayed on well for three hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.",C+
MAC,"SWEET, NO SUGAR",Lipstick,"a soft, pinky-peach with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation applied unevenly and sank into my lip lines noticeably from the beginning. The texture was lightweight with moderate slip and a thinner feel, though it never felt clingy or drying. I don’t know if it was the lightness of the color or formula itself, but this shade was prone to emphasizing imperfections and texture. It lasted for two and a half hours and sank heavily into my lip lines after two hours of wear. The formula felt a touch moisturizing over time.",C-
GIVENCHY ,MYSTIC PINK,Highlighter,"a pale, peachy beige with warm undertones and a sparkling, glittery finish. The formula isn’t supposed to “leave any textured effects” and be “easy to build” with “a veil of mother-of-pearl with multi-glitter reflections.” It had a denser, slightly firmer consistency that needed a moderately-dense brush (I used a tapered highlighting brush) to work well with it as more feathery brushes (like a fan brush) seemed to pick up a dusting of sparkle.

It can be used wet or dry with application using a dampened brushing a much more metallic, high-shine finish and a bit more pigmentation with less effort. Dry yielded medium, buildable pigmentation that lasted well for eight hours but had a fair amount of sparkle/glitter travel over the course of the day, whereas dampened application had semi-opaque coverage that stayed on well for as long but had less glitter migration. This is going to be most suitable for those who like a healthy dose of sparkle/micro-glitter in their highlighters.",B-
MAC,JUST CHILLING,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium silver with cool undertones and a sparkling, shiny finish. This shade had more shine than glitter compared to the other shades, though it was still plenty glittery on the lid. It had a very brightening effect when used on the inner tearduct or lash line. The consistency felt as smooth as you’d expect something packed with glitter would–not like silk but not gritty–and yielded nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer.

I applied it to my lid using a pressing motion, which helped to minimize fallout while achieving even coverage. The eyeshadow stayed on well for eight hours before creasing in my fine lines a bit and had noticeable fallout over time, though there was a significant amount of sparkle/glitter still on my lid (and most of the color was present).
",B
MAC,JOY TO,Eyeshadow,"a rosy, brown base that flashed blue-to-purple most of the time; it looked like a grayish purple when I applied it to my lid, though there was a warmer base that came through at certain angles. It was packed with glitter particles and had a slightly sandy consistency, but it was sandy in the least awful way–I could tell there was a ton of glitter in the eyeshadow, but it didn’t feel gritty or chunky.

If you know me, I’m not a fan of using my fingertips for application as I can’t get much precision that way, though I certainly tried these that way but found that using a flat, synthetic brush (like MAC’s 242S) worked just as well as fingertips and gave me the precision I wanted to cram three of these shades on my lid. I pressed and patted the product onto my lid, which had minimal fallout during application, but when I went to blend the edgse a bit, there was a little more fallout and some sparkles traveled.

It creased faintly after six hours of wear, though it didn’t progress much beyond a faint line running my deeper crease area, with light to moderate fallout; after 10 hours, there was additional fallout but it looked like about 75-80% of the glitter was on my lid as the look had plenty of sparkle and impact at the end of the day.",B-
MAC,MAJOR WIN,Eyeshadow,"a medium pink base with warm undertones and lighter pink and silver glitter. It looked a bit lighter and icier most of the time after I had applied it to my lid. The texture was as smooth as I’d expect given how much glitter was in it, and the glitter felt softer, less gritty. It had medium, buildable pigmentation (best applied with a dampened brush over a glitter adhesive for maximum coverage in a single layer) that adhered well by pressing and patting into place with minimal blending along the edges. I was able to use a flat, synthetic brush with the formula, though fingertips worked well for larger areas.

There was slight fallout during application, and then there was some more throughout wear, though a lot of it seemed to stay directly underneath my area and did not venture much beyond that area. There was still a significant amount of glitter still present on my lid after eight hours–at a glance, I thought it all remained as it was still quite sparkly, but there was definite fallout over time.",B-
MAC,MAKE A WISH,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium, chartreuse green with strong, warm yellow undertones and green and silver glitter. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage with a second layer or if I had used it with a dampened brush. The texture was fairly soft, smooth, and not too loosely-pressed in the pan, though it obviously had a lot of glitter, which I could feel by touch. I found this shade applied particularly well with very little fallout when pressed and patted onto the lid, both with fingertips and a flat, synthetic brush. It wore well for eight hours overall, though there was a noticeable amount of fallout present (it seemed like 80-85% remained on my lid).",B
MAC,P FOR PINK,Eyeshadow,"a medium, rosy pink with warm undertones and multi-colored pearl and silver glitter. It had good pigmentation in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with a touch more patted on top or fully opaque when used with a dampened brush in the first place. This shade shifted a bit less, but it seemed to have more multi-colored sparkles/reflects and flashed pink and gold and silver to my eye. The consistency was fairly smooth, though packed with fine glitter, and blended out along the edges without having tons of fallout, but there were some particles that spread beyond (like into my crease) even when I was trying to be careful.

It started to crease faintly after six hours, but it did not seem to get much worse over time, and there was slight fallout present at six hours and more after eight hours. The eyeshadow still had a lot of sparkle and shine present on my lid/inner tearduct after eight hours, though.",B
FENTY BEAUTY,FROST HUNNY,Palette,"three, warm-toned jumbo-sized pencils that are supposed to be usable on eyes and lips, though they’re pretty disappointing unless you’re looking to draw on your arms. They’re uncomfortable to apply due to the thinner texture that had little creaminess/slip, and they are even harder to blend, diffuse, or otherwise use in a meaningful manner. The formula across these three shades was as frustrating as I wrote about in my Frost Bunny review, which can be read for a more dialed-in experience or click “formula overview” for any of the shades below.
",F
NARS,RANSOM,Palette,"a new, limited set of four jumbo-sized lip pencils in shades of soft brown, coral, and plum. The set contains four full-sized Velvet Matte Lip Pencils, in all new shades, giving it a total value of $108. This set is exclusive to Nordstrom. The quality of two shades was consistent with what I’d expect from the formula and are worth considering, but the other two were more disappointing, so the set was a wash.",B
MAC,"OH, DARLING!",Highlighter,"a bright, medium gold with strong, warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, dense consistency that felt firmer to the touch, but it wasn’t stiff to work with. The powder picked up well with a moderately dense brush (I often use a blush brush with this type of highlighting formula), applied evenly, and blended out with little effort. This shade is part of the permanent range (in regular packaging/pan design), and the specially-packaged holiday edition was consistent in color and performance with the permanent offering. This shade stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me.",A
FENTY BEAUTY,AVALANCHE,Palette,"seven shades in small, plastic jars with a twist-off lid and a small, plastic insert that sits on top of the opening to prevent product loss. They are small jars, which made them more fiddly for me personally as someone with larger hands/longer fingertips, but they didn’t seem overly prone to tipping over. These are best for someone who enjoys working with loose eyeshadow and will use these primarily as eyeshadow rather than as a cheek product as they’re easiest and more consistent in performance on the eyes.

The formula is supposed to have a “melt-worthy texture” that is “smooth” and uses “mega-fine pigments” that yield “high-impact” and “rich, blendable color.” They can be used as “eyeshadow, cheekbone highlight, blush, [dabbed] over lipstick.” The texture seemed finely-milled as one would expect of a loose powder, but I had a few shades that were clumpy in the jars, which I recommend de-clumping by using the end of a brush handle (the part without the brush itself) to swirl gently to break up the clumps. The shades were fairly blendable with some being more or less blendable, and in general, shades that seemed blendable as eyeshadow did not always blend out as easily on my cheeks (as a blush or highlighter).

The pigmentation varied from shade to shade with some being more medium in coverage, but buildable, while others were more opaque applied dry. Most of them intensified and were more opaque when applied with a dampened brush. The formula is called “metallic powder” but they were more of a pearl to frost finish; they’re not intensely metallic, which may or may not be a deal-breaker.	They definitely can be dabbed onto the lips and blended by gently brushing a fingertip back and forth to add a subtle, pearlescent effect.",B
HUDA BEAUTY,SAPPHIRE,Palette,"a new, limited edition set of shimmers and mattes with a blue theme. If you’re someone who tends to use a dampened brush, fingertips, or a glitter glue with their shimmers and doesn’t mind using an eyeshadow primer, I expect that the more original color scheme/types of shades may make it workable. I do think that it is a fussy palette and needs some patience/specific techniques and tools to work with. The mattes were dustier and not as pigmented as anticipated, while a few of the shimmers had less desirable textures that made them a challenge to use.",C+
COLOUR POP,SKYFALL,Lipstick,"a deep, raspberry pink with subtle, cool undertones and a flat, matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The texture was thin, a little watery, and it did not seem to apply with the same “look” as a lot of the Ultra Mattes–it had a softer finish with more product that gathered in my lip lines as the product dried down. Due to the color being bright and deep, the product in my lip lines wasn’t as noticeable from a normal viewing distance. This shade lasted for over six hours, left a stain behind, and was somewhat drying.",B+
COLOUR POP,LA LA LAND,Lipstick,"a deep red with cool, blue undertones and a flat, matte finish. It had good color payoff in a single stroke, though it needed a second layer for true opacity. The liquid lipstick had a lightweight and thin texture–almost a bit more watery compared to other shades in the range–that spread evenly across my lips. It dried to a matte finish quickly with slight product that settled into my lip lines, but the product didn’t appear “cracked” when I smiled. The color wore well for over six hours, left a strong stain behind, and was lightly drying over time.",B+
COLOUR POP,CHRONOS,Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange-red with warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, while the texture was smooth, lightweight, and thin without being watery. It dried down very quickly and looked a little dusty to my eye, but it didn’t seem to exacerbate my lip lines too noticeably. The liquid lipstick stayed on well for over six hours and left a strong stain behind (lingered into the next day) but was drying over time.",B
WET 'N' WILD,LET IT GLOW,Highlighter,"a rich, medium-dark copper with strong, warm orange undertones and a golden sheen. It had opaque pigmentation that applied easily in a single layer, though it was a denser, firmer texture that didn’t have any excess powderiness, so it was easy to apply less for sheerer coverage if preferred. The powder applied evenly to my skin and blended out nicely along the edges. There was a moderate sheen that did not emphasize my skin’s natural texture. It stayed on well for eight hours before I noticed slight fading on my skin.
",A-
MAC,DEVOTED TO CHILI,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, coppery red with warm undertones and a satin finish. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, moderately emollient consistency that was comfortable to apply and to wear as it was lightweight and lightly hydrating. It took about an hour for it to wear down to a flat, matte finish (or blot lightly to get there faster). This shade stayed on well for five and a half hours on me.",A
MAC,MANDARIN O,Lipstick,"a medium-dark coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had medium pigmentation that applied unevenly and seemed to gravitate toward every lip line and bit of texture I had on my lips. The texture was lightweight and velvety, which made it comfortable to apply, but there was enough slip that made it difficult to apply well. It lasted for four hours, but it faded unevenly and pulled into my lip lines, though it was lightly hydrating over time.
",C
MAC,STYLE SHOCKED,Lipstick,"a rich orange with warm, red undertones and a semi-matte finish. The lipstick had nearly opaque color payoff in a single stroke, which adhered fairly evenly and didn’t seem to gather in my lip lines much (just barely). It had a smooth, velvety consistency that felt emollient going on but not to the point where it felt slippery while worn. It wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.",A-
FENTY BEAUTY,KILLAWATT FOIL,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette featuring seven hues designed for highlighting the eyes and cheeks. Those who don’t find all the shades usable to highlight cheeks will be able to use those shades as eyeshadows. There were only two shades that I feel really stood out in the palette and were truest to the Killawatt formula: Stone Cold and Hunny Slope. Shades like Chillz, Scandal’ice, and Coppin Ice have larger sparkles/shimmer to them and less pigmentation, and I don’t think this was conveyed that well through the marketing on this. This is definitely a palette most suitable for someone who likes more sparkle and glitter in their products. Worth noting, the palette is thicker cardboard, which was unexpected compared to past Fenty palettes of similar size/price point.",B
MAC,SNOWFLUSHED,Highlighter,"a peachy-orange base with peach-to-pink shifting pearl and sparkle. It had good pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage with half of a layer more. The texture was smooth, despite being a rather glittery shade, and dense, so a moderately dense brush and a medium hand worked best–it had the baked gelee-like texture that doesn’t have any powderiness, isn’t stiff so much as just denser in the pan. The powder applied evenly to bare skin and diffused along the edges, but the base color was fairly prominent so it added warmth and an orange-brown tone to my skin, along with a strong peach-to-pink shift, depending on the angle. Some of the sparkle/glitter migrated beyond my cheeks over the eight and a half hours it lasted for, though.",B+
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,STARS IN YOUR EYES,Palette,"a new, limited edition eyeshadow palette for the holidays that is broken into four “looks” with three shades featured in each. I was impressed by this palette, as the mattes were fantastic–pigmented, creamy, and blendable–and most of the shimmers performed well, though a couple seemed on the sheerer side (but the brand’s official swatches showed every shade was opaque).

The shade range is certainly something we’ve seen before, and it’s release alongside Urban Decay’s Naked Cherry invites immediately comparison, but the Stars in Your Eyes is still a bump up in price, even if it is significantly better in performance. As I’ve said in the past, I always welcome high-quality products, even if they seem “done” for those of us who have indulged already or who have been here for awhile.",A-
NARS,MANIC,Palette,"four full-sized Velvet Matte Lip Pencils, in all new shades, giving it a total value of $108, and it is exclusive to Sephora. All four shades were pigmented and wore well for at least four hours; one shade, Vicious, could have had a more flattering finish, but from a normal viewing distance, its flaws weren’t visible.",A-
FENTY BEAUTY,SNOW NIGHTS,Palette,"three, limited edition frosted lipsticks. I struggled with Frost $auce, which was sheerer and harder to apply evenly, whereas the other two shades were much more pigmented and had better applciations.

Each shade contains 0.065 oz., which is just a smidgen bigger than a full-sized Mattemoiselle Lipstick that contains 0.06 oz. and retails for $18.00. This formula hasn’t been released previously, but using the price point on the Mattemoiselle (which has similar packaging, sizing, and so on), this set contains $58.50 worth of lipstick for $36.",B-
CHANEL,ELECTRUM LAMÉ (905),Eyeshadow,"a pale, white gold with subtle, warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had medium, buildable pigmentation with a soft, lightly dusty consistency that was blendable and easy to work with, though there was a bit of fallout due. If I used a dampened brush, I was able to get opaque coverage in one layer. This shade wore well for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.",B-
CHANEL,CUIVRE LAMÉ (907),Eyeshadow,"a rich brown with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It “melted” after a few minutes on my skin, which gave it a smoother appearance that was more glowing than overtly shimmery. It had opaque pigmentation with a soft, slightly drier formula (felt more like a hybrid, powder-gel texture) that applied well and blended out nicely. The color stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me before fading.
",A
CHANEL,VERT LAMÉ (906),Eyeshadow,"a blackened green with warm, olive undertones and a soft, emerald and olive green shimmer. It had good color coverage that applied well to bare skin, but it was slightly richer and the black base came through more if I used it with a dampened brush. The eyeshadow had a smooth, slightly dusty consistency (but only noticeable in the pan) that applied evenly and blended out with ease. It showed signs of fading after eight and a half hours on me.
",A-
CHANEL,NOIR LAMÉ (908),Eyeshadow,"a deep black with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was semi-opaque in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. Using it wet enabled richer, deeper pigmentation in one layer. The texture was smooth to the touch and lightly creamy, but it was still a powder, that adhered well to bare skin and blended out nicely. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before it started to fade noticeably.",A-
MAC,MULL IT OVER,Lipstick,"a muted, medium rosy coral with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff that applied fairly evenly to my lips, though it had enough slip that the color sank into my lip lines noticeably and some of the product clung noticeably to imperfections on my lips (which I hadn’t seen prior, as I had exfoliated prior to doing the swatches!). It had a lightweight, velvety consistency with noticeable slip that helped it glide across my lips without tugging. It wore well for three hours and was slightly hydrating.",B-
MAC,SULTRINESS,Lipstick,"a medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good pigmentation in a single layer, though it wasn’t opaque and did not build up to full coverage. The lipstick had a velvety, smooth consistency that glided across my lips with ease and distributed color fairly evenly. There was a touch of product that gathered in my lip lines initially, but it did not worsen too much over the three hours it wore for. The formula felt slightly moisturizing over time.",B+
MAC,A LITTLE TAMED,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark pink-coral with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque in a single layer, though it didn’t build up well as the more I applied, the more product that sank into my lip lines and I felt like the application looked less even as well. The texture was lightweight, thin but didn’t feel clingy, and was comfortable to wear. It stayed on well for four and a half hours, but the color continued to settle into my lip lines over time. The formula felt lightly hydrating while worn.",B
CHANEL,FLAMING LIPS (812),Lipgloss,"a rich, ruby red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a metallic pearl paired with a shiny, glossy finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which applied evenly across my lips without emphasizing my lip lines. The consistency was smooth, light-medium in thickness but still lightweight, and mostly non-sticky. The gloss did feel a bit thicker compared to other Rouge Coco Glosses, but it was also much more pigmented than the typical shade, though officially the formula runs “sheer to opaque” (and rarely gives insight in what’s what!). This shade stayed on well for five hours and was hydrating over time. I didn’t experience any feathering or bleeding, but keep in mind that those are not things I normally experience.",A+
CHANEL,LIQUID BRONZE (808),Lipgloss,"a soft, medium brown with fine, gold and bronze pearl. It had sheer color coverage with even dispersion of shimmer/pearl that spread well across my lips and didn’t sink into my lip lines. The gloss had a lightweight, plush, more gel-like consistency that was comfortable to wear and mostly non-sticky. It wore well for four hours and was moisturizing while worn.",A-
FENTY BEAUTY,FROST BUNNY,Palette,"three shades of “creamy, metallic” crayon-style product that can be used on the eyes and lips. The formula is supposed to have “insane glide” that is “creamy upon application” but sets. The brand says that they can be used as eyeliner, eyeshadow, lipstick, or lip liner. I found the performance to be underwhelming both on the eyes and lips, though on lips it was particularly disappointing. The best use for these were as eyeliners, though there are far better pencil eyeliners on the market.

The pencils feature a very waxy, thinner consistency that does tug somewhat (eyes and lips) and often requires multiple passes over curved areas–they’d swatch well enough on my arm but in practice, I had trouble getting even, opaque coverage whether I tried the formula as an eyeliner, eyeshadow, or lipstick. They were easiest to use on my lower lash line, as they only tugged a bit, but the coverage seemed to lift slightly as I tried to layer and even out the color or else it would pull away along any fine lines. However, if I tried to diffuse or blend out the line, product flaked off or lifted away randomly. While swatches were difficult to remove on my arm/hand, most shades disappeared within six hours on my waterline and were noticeably faded after eight hours on my lower lash line.

As an eyeshadow, they applied poorly with fingertips and a brush as the formula dries so quickly that most of the product remained on my fingertip or wouldn’t adhere to my skin (from the brush), so applying directly from the pencil was best, which resulted in decent coverage but was often patchy or uneven. If I attempted to go back over areas with the pencil, I couldn’t glide the pencil; I had pat and push it onto just the area or else it would lift away other areas. When I tried to diffuse the edges, whether I just used a fluffy brush or fingertips along the bare edge or if I tried to use a powder eyeshadow (say, in the crease) to blend the shimmer shades and a matte crease shade together, the cream eyeshadow lifted away and left behind bald patches. I reached the point where it was a game of applying and accepting that they’d never look great on my actual lids. They did have decent wear on my lids with about eight to nine hours without creasing but the color started to flake off.

As a lip product, the formula actually managed to get worse! They take some maneuvering to apply evenly, as the texture was thin and drier, and the pencil tugged a bit in order to get even coverage on my lips. The big issue was that I could not press my lips together, not even once, whether intentionally, accidentally, or while talking, or else the color would lift away noticeably. I tried leaving the color alone for a solid five minutes in case there was some “dry down” that I needed to wait for (nothing about the texture suggested that), but it didn’t help. The strange part was that it stayed on well with respect to drinking/light meals but if the product came in contact with itself, it gave up. I tried not to press my lips together, but inevitably, just talking proved enough to cause patchiness within an hour of wear that worsened over time. (Please reference Sunfrost, where I took a photo after gently pressing my lips together, not even rubbing, just a gentle press, and see how much lifting occurred–it continued to lift as long as I had it on.)",F
FENTY BEAUTY,SNOW DAZE,Palette,"three, “creamy, metallic lipsticks” that have “hyper-vivid impact.” Two of three shades in the set had good pigmentation, application, and wear, but one (What’s Your Numb’a) was semi-sheer and applied unevenly. If you’re easily bothered by the feel of sparkle/shimmer in your lip products, this formula may not be for you.

Each shade contains 0.065 oz., which is just a smidgen bigger than a full-sized Mattemoiselle Lipstick that contains 0.06 oz. and retails for $18.00. This formula hasn’t been released previously, but using the price point on the Mattemoiselle (which has similar packaging, sizing, and so on), this set contains $58.50 worth of lipstick for $36.",B-
CHANEL,ROSE LAMÉ (826),Eyeshadow,"a sparkling, light peach with subtle, pink undertones and warmer, golden shimmer and micro-sparkle. The consistency was lightly creamy with a touch of tackiness (when I touched it with my fingertip) that wasn’t too thick or too thin on my lid, so I had no trouble applying it with opaque color coverage in a single layer but it could easily be diffused and buffed out for a sheerer effect if desired. The eyeshadow stayed on well for almost 10 hours before creasing faintly, and there seemed to be just a smidgen of fallout over time.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,BLITZ GLITZ,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark plum with warm, brownish undertones and cooler violet, copper, and purple sparkle. It’s a loosely-pressed powder with a moderate amount of larger sparkle/micro-glitter, so while the base felt quite smooth, I could feel the bits of sparkle as well (as expected). I liked using a flat, dense brush to press the product onto my lid/lower lash line to get opaque coverage and minimal fallout. If I used my fingertip, I felt like I actually ended up with too much product that resulted in some fallout. When I blended out the edges, I didn’t notice fallout, but some of the sparkles pulled away from the initial placement, so if you had a very matte crease that you wanted to stay matte, you’d need to be very precise with your blending. On me, it wore well for eight hours with slight fallout over time.
",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,FUCKING FABULOUS,Lipstick,"a bright, medium red with cool undertones and a lightly glossy, cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a smooth, lightly creamy texture that had detectable slip but not enough that it felt heavy or slippery after it was applied. The color applied evenly and didn’t gather in my lip lines, and the glossier finish seemed to make my lips appear smoother overall. It wore well for five hours, was moderately hydrating, and didn’t feather/bleed on me.",A
COLOUR POP,STRENGTH,Palette,"a new, limited edition trio that features two lipglosses and one liquid lipstick (in the Ultra Satin formula). All three products performed decently, with JJ being the best of the three. 20% of proceeds from the sale of this set or any of the individual colors will be donated to Make a Wish.",A-
NARS,CHAOS,Palette,"two full-sized jumbo-sized lip pencils in dusty coral and deep berry hues. Depending on one’s tolerance for slightly non-drying to slightly drying products, the set may or may not be worth putting on the wish list. I think that these two are not the best of the brand’s formula, though they are not the worst.

A full-sized Velvet Matte Lip Pencil retails for $27.00 and contains 0.08 oz., so this set contains two full-sized Velvet Matte Lip Pencils giving it a total value of $54.00.",B+
DIOR,LUCKY STAR,Palette,"a new, limited edition holiday palette featuring gold, orange, and brown with four shades being rather shimmery and one being more satin to matte. This palette was more of a mixed bag, though none of the shades were total misses, so I think it would be more about expectations, application style, and preferences on whether this is a winner or not.",B+
MAC,SHOCKING REVELATION,Lipstick,"a rich, pin-red with cool undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that covered my lips evenly and smoothly in a single layer. The texture was lightweight with moderate slip, which made it comfortable to apply and to wear, as it was thin but did not look or feel clingy. It wore well for five and a half hours and was lightly hydrating over time and didn’t leave much of a stain behind despite its red color.",A
MAC,BURNING LOVE,Lipstick,"a deep plum with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had excellent pigmentation that adhered evenly to my lips and applied fluidly without catching on imperfections or getting into my lip lines. The lipstick had a velvety, lightweight consistency that had enough slip to glide but never felt slippery when worn. The color stayed on nicely for six hours and was slightly moisturizing.",A
NARS,HEARTBREAKER,Palette,"three blushes from the brand’s permanent range. Oddly, the brand’s often-released Orgasm blush fell short here; it was firm and stiff to work with, heartbreaking really… Luster was dustier in the palette than it has been in its standalone format but was easy to work with, just not quite the same in finish. Amour seemed fairly consistent with the last version I have, though.",C+
FENTY BEAUTY,UNBUTTON,Lipstick,"a dark peach with soft, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had opaque pigmentation with a smooth, very fluid consistency that was thin and moved very, very easily–it actually felt a bit oily to me. I struggle sometimes with this formula for application as a lot of product is captured on the applicator to the point where I feel like I’m getting more product on my lips than I need, and then paired with the fluidity on the texture means it’s easy to get outside the natural edge of my lips if I am not patient and careful. As this shade dried down, it did sink into my lip lines a bit, but it felt flexible and was extremely comfortable to wear. It does well through drinking water and tea with minimal transfer on the cup and made it through a meal mostly intact (still opaque) but was more prone to leaving traces behind on a glass after that. It wore well for eight hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
FENTY BEAUTY,UNCUFFED,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, rosy mauve with subtle, warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, while the texture was thin, emollient, and fluid, so it spread easily (almost too easily given the applicator held more product than one needed for full coverage). It applied evenly and didn’t settle into my lip lines noticeably, and it dried down within a minute to a flexible, comfortable feel that was lightweight but still quite matte. It was transfer-resistant but a bit of product was left on my cup/glass and if dabbed with a napkin, though it still wore quite well. The lipstick stayed on nicely for nine hours, including through a meal, and felt neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
DIOR,MOONLIGHT,Palette,"a new, limited edition holiday palette that features shimmery taupe, silver, and black. It’s a sparkly, more metallic take on a classic smoky eye. All five shades performed well; they were pigmented, blendable, and easy to use with seven- to eight-hour wear.",A-
NARS,SHREDDED,Lipstick,"a medium pink with strong,w arm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good pigmentation, though it wasn’t quite opaque in a single layer, that covered my lips evenly. The texture was lightweight, thin and fluid without being watery, but the dry down did emphasize my lip texture and some of my deeper lip lines. When I smiled, the color stretched comfortably and looked quite smooth and reflective. It wore well for four and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating over time.",B+
NARS,PIERCE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark red with subtle, warm undertones and a satin sheen. It had rich color payoff in a single layer, and the liquid lipstick had a thin, lightweight consistency that was very fluid and spread easily across my lips. It dried down within 30 seconds and was mostly dry, but if I pressed my lips together, there a bit of tackiness, though the color didn’t pull away when I did so. This shade stayed on well for six and a half hours, left a very faint stain behind, and was non-drying.",A
HOURGLASS,VOL. 4,Palette,"a new, limited edition holiday offering that contains four existing shades and two new, exclusive shades (Filtered Bronze Light and Luminous Glow). The powders performed consistently with other Hourglass powders, so those who enjoy these palettes will likely enjoy this one, too, if the included shades work for your skin tone.

The palette contains $10.51 worth of Ambient Lighting Powder, $5.13 worth of Ambient Lighting Bronzer, $20.27 worth of Ambient Lighting Blush, and $9.50 worth of Metallic Strobe Lighting Powder for a total value of $45.41. If you expect to use most of the powders but don’t usually finish products or often travel, it might be “worth” it to you, though typically palettes like these offer more for your money (since you are buying in “bulk” in a way) or else aren’t nearly so drastic in the difference between value and price.",A
NARS,SCANDAL,Palette,"a new, limited edition holiday release featuring six shades exclusively available at NARS. This palette will be most versatile when paired with your go-to neutrals, as the inclusion of both a deep brown and rich black made it harder to get anything but an intense, smoky eye out of it, though I gave it my best effort to use this palette and only this palette for a cohesive look! The quality was good overall with Stage Dive being underwhelming.",B+
COLOUR POP,JOURNEY,Palette,"a new, limited edition set of four, shimmery cream eyeshadows. Three were fantastic, while one fell short for me, though it was workable depending on how one wanted to use it. 20% of proceeds from the sale of products from the ColourPop x Delilah collection will be donated to Make-a-Wish, including this set (or the individual shades, if purchased separately).",A-
MAC,MY TWEEDY,Lipstick,"a deep peach with warm, orange undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a smooth, velvety texture that was lightweight and comfortable to apply in a fluid motion. The lipstick emphasized my lip texture and found any imperfections on my lips, and it did pull into my lip lines from the beginning and worsened over the three hours it lasted for. It felt non-drying while worn.",C+
MAC,IMPULSIVE,Lipstick,"a light-medium brown with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage that applied evenly to my lips without dragging or tugging on them. The consistency felt very lightweight and thin, but it didn’t look or feel clingy on my lips, and it had a natural finish to it that took an hour or so to mattify. It wore well for three and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing over time.",A-
MAC,SCATTERED PETALS,Lipstick,"a light-medium pink with stronger, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. This was one of the few shades that looked closer to matte from the initial application, whereas a lot of the other shades had to wear down to a matte finish over time. The pigmentation was good, though it wasn’t opaque, and the color had a tendency to pull away at and settle into my lip lines. The texture was lightweight, thin without feeling clingy, though it looked clingy as it emphasized my lip texture. It lasted for three hours but faded unevenly and settled more noticeably into my lip lines. The formula felt neither drying nor hydrating to me.",C+
CHANEL,NO. 5,Lipstick,"a rich red with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a smooth, velvety texture that was incredibly lightweight and thin without feeling clingy. The color applied evenly across my lips and never dragged or tugged on them during application. It wore well for over six hours, left a faint stain behind, and was hydrating over time.
",A
URBAN DECAY,DEVILISH,Lipstick,"a brighter, medium pink with moderate, warm u ndertones and a mix of cooler and warmer pearl and larger sparkle. It had a Metallized finish, but it was only medium in coverage with more of a tinted base that brought out the natural pink tones in my lips and deepened them. The texture was lightweight with moderate slip and a touch of tackiness, and while it wasn’t too thin, I could feel the texture of the sparkles in it as I applied and to a moderate degree while worn (which may be a deal-breaker for some). It wore well for four hours and was lightly hydrating while worn.",B
CHANEL,LE LION DE CHANEL,Highlighter,"a medium, golden peach with warm, orange undertones and a sparkling, luminous sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation with a moderate sheen that intensified to more metallic when worn at full coverage. Per the brand, they said to “build coverage for a more intense highlighting effect,” which was fairly accurate; I’d just say it was more of a moderate glow at semi-sheer to medium coverage, not “subtle” as suggested. The powder was smooth to the touch, denser and firmer but not stiff or difficult to diffuse and blend out on my skin. I would recommend using a moderately dense blush or highlighting brush to pick up product from the pan, though. It applied evenly to bare skin and didn’t emphasize my skin’s natural texture. This shade stayed on well for eight and a half hours before it started to fade on me.",A-
NARS,HARDCORE,Lipstick,"a light-medium, golden copper with warm, rosy undertones and a frosted, metallic sheen. The lighter color seemed to make the shimmer/metallic finish really pop in this particular shade, as a lot of the shades in the formula have been deeper. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, and it applied better with more even, more pigmented coverage on my lips than when I tried swatching it on my arm. A second layer can be applied for full coverage if preferred. The consistency was lightweight, thin, and a little more watery than other shades in the formula. It dried down to a transfer-resistant finish, and it didn’t slide around, but I could tell it wasn’t 100% flat/dry after the initial dry down. This particular shade did emphasize my lip lines/texture a bit more after it finished drying. It lasted for four and a half hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
NARS,SHATTER,Lipstick,"a medium brown with warm undertones and a pale, bronze sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which could be made opaque with a second layer (just make sure to let the first layer dry completely before adding more product). It had a lightweight consistency that was quite fluid but shy of being watery, so it was manageable along the edges of my lips without too much worry. The color stayed on well for five hours and was non-drying.",A-
NARS,LAGUNA AND FORT DE FRANCE,Palette,"the brand’s iconic Laguna bronzer along with more recently-released Fort de France highlighter. The bronzer performed poorly for me–very stiff and dry in the pan, which yielded product in clumps and was difficult to apply and build up. The highlighter performed well, but the bronzer was so disappointing that I’d give this set a miss myself.

A full-sized Bonzing Powder retails for $40.00 and contains 0.28 oz. or costs $142.86/oz. A full-sized Highlighting Powder retails for $38.00 and contains 0.49 oz. or costs $77.55/oz. This set contains $11.43 worth of bronzer and $10.08 worth of highlighter for a total value of $21.51.

This set is exclusive to NARS and Sephora.",F
NATASHA DENONA,STAR,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette featuring shades from the Star palette. While the mini eyeshadow palette didn’t perform poorly, it wasn’t consistent with the shades in the original Star palette, which is permanent, so I’m not sure why there was any inconsistency or why the ingredient lists aren’t the same between the two. Most notably, Orion was much, much creamier and deeper in color, while Atik changed in depth and undertone. The other three shades were more similar in color, but Cosmo was a bit lighter depending on how it reflected the light.

If you liked Natasha Denona’s shimmer formula in the past because of how cream-like they were, you’ll likely be disappointed with this palette as the formula has changed to be denser/firmer with less creaminess (though I do find they wear better than the creamier formula but that’s without primer; with primer they’re comparable).",B+
NARS,DEFIANT,Palette,"a new, limited edition trio of glosses. The three shades performed similarly; they’re about average for a lipgloss–non-sticky and comfortable to wear but aren’t particularly long-wearing and because they’re sheerer (as intended) they could apply more evenly/stay out of my lip lines better. NARS Lip Gloss retails for $26.00 and contains 0.18 fl. oz., and this set includes three full-sized glosses, so it has a total value of $78.00.",B
DIOR,STAND OUT (649),Blush,"a bright, medium tangerine orange with strong, warm yellow undertones and a golden pearl sheen. It had rich color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly on bare skin. The powder was smooth to the touch, dense but not stiff, and remained blendable on my skin, even when applied more intensely. The finish was luminous but didn’t emphasize my skin’s texture or appear overtly shimmery. It stayed on nicely for eight and a half hours on me before it faded a bit.",A
DIOR,MIDNIGHT WISH,Highlighter,"a medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic sheen with faint sparkles. There seemed to be a slight rosiness to it as it looked a bit coppery at certain angles (when it wasn’t reflecting light as much). It had a smooth, lightly creamy texture that was denser and firmer in the pan, but it wasn’t stiff or thick, so it was still easy to pick up with a brush and blended out easily on my skin. It yielded a strong shine that was bordering on metallic, and it seemed to emphasize skin’s natural texture when worn at semi-opaque to opaque coverage levels. It stayed on nicely for nine hours on me before fading noticeably.",A
URBAN DECAY,LOVE DRUG,Eyeliner,"a medium, reddish plum with subtle, warm undertones and a pearl finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which adhered evenly and smoothly to my lash line without dragging or tugging on it. The texture was waxy, so it felt velvety and smooth but not wet or truly cream-like. The eyeliner stayed on well for nine hours before thinning slightly.",A-
URBAN DECAY,BLACK MARKET,Eyeliner,"a soft black with subtle pearl and neutral-to-cool undertones. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly in a single layer, and it was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. With the waxier formula, I prefer to do short, overlapping strokes to get an even, opaque line of product. The pencil glided across my lower lash line without tugging and was comfortable to use. It lasted well for nine hours on me before it started to fade noticeably.",A-
URBAN DECAY,JUICY,Lipstick,"a soft, peachy-coral with pink and gold sparkle and finer pearl. It had a Metallized finish, but it did not have the opacity of the Cream finish, though there was plenty of pearl and had coverage that was more in the vein of the Sheer Shimmer finish. The lipstick had semi-sheer pigmentation that covered my lips evenly, though there was a touch of product gathered in my deeper lip lines but wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance. It had a smooth, lightweight consistency that was just a touch tacky with moderate slip. It wore well for four hours and was hydrating over time.",B
URBAN DECAY,CHERRY,Lipstick,"a deep burgundy with subtle, cool undertones and a lightly glossy, cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly and smoothly across my lips without tugging. The texture was lightly creamy, moderately emollient, and had some slip on my lips but had enough tackiness that it didn’t seem to move around too easily on me, so it didn’t feather or bleed around the edges while I wore it. I was surprised this applied as evenly as it did–not quite perfect but vastly better than expected based on the texture and coverage level. This shade stayed on well for five hours and was moisturizing while worn.",B+
URBAN DECAY,NAKED CHERRY,Palette,"a pale peach highlighter, mid-tone pink blush, and iridescent white “topper” (aka highlighter). This palette is definitely going to work best for fairer complexions, though the blush is marketed as “universally-flattering.” The Naked Cherry collection seems like a big launch for the brand, so it struck me as odd not to create standalone cheek colors or else a light and dark version of a cheek trio to reach their very diverse customer base. The quality of the blush left a lot to be desired, so the trio was a big miss for me regardless of whether it was going to show up on my skin tone (which it did).",B-
NARS,PROVOCATEUR,Palette,"a new, limited edition smoky set of shades for the holiday season. I felt like it was very fall/winter appropriate, and it definitely fit the brand’s punk theme for the collection. The six shades worked well together, though you’ll have to enjoy your shimmers or supplement with more mattes as only one shade was matte (Endless Party). I found that the satin-to-pearl finish of two of the shades (Smash It Up, Not For Sale) worked well in place of mattes for depth as they were quite dark. The only shade that was fussier was Screech, as it was packed with sparkle, so it was better applied with a dampened brush or used with a mixing medium to prevent some fallout (though it was usable dry for me).",A-
VISEART,GRANDE PRO (VOL. 2),Palette,"a new, limited edition palette that’s individually numbered (3,000 made) that features 30–whew!–shimmer shades that range from pearl to metallic to large glitter. The palette was designed for professional makeup artists first and foremost (in terms of the creation and development process), and as a shimmery complement to the original Grande Pro (Vol. 1) palette, which was all matte (and also designed for professional makeup artists). Each column represents a different type of finish, so depending on the finish, it may be more or less pigmented, more or less glittery. Columns two and six were the least user-friendly within the palette; the other four columns were similar to shimmery, powder-based eyeshadow formulas.

Columns two and six have larger glitter particles, and they are recommended to be used with a mixing medium to “set and seal glitter in place,” and it is recommended to dampen the brush, pick up product, and apply with a “patting/pressing motion.” Without the brand’s more specific descriptions (which is what we want to see to help guide our expectations!), this palette would have rated lower, so I urge anyone interested in this to consider each of the finishes to ensure it will work with your application style and techniques and meet your needs, which I’ve described in detail below.

You have to either be a die-hard Viseart fan or love larger, chunky glitter as a traditional consumer to consider this palette; whether this is a go-to for professional makeup artists, I’ll leave it up to those who practice to comment below with how it fits with their kit. I love some of the shades and finishes used within the palette, and I hope we’ll see the shades offered as singles some day or incorporated in future palettes (preferably a smaller format!). I think if some of the jewel-toned shades catch your eye, but you’re not into the glitter or have no need for a 30-shade palette, I highly recommend Bijoux Royal (or Ribbons Boheme for brighter, slightly more popping shades). I really enjoyed columns one, three, four, and five.

Column one is labeled “Crystalline Highlighters” that have “sheer satin coverage, crystal finish.” I think they’re being unsold, as one was sheer, another was semi-sheer, two were medium-full, and one was opaque. I swatched these five shades dry and wet (just using water). This finish was easy to use like any other shimmer eyeshadow; they applied well, blended out easily, and lasted for eight to nine hours on me.

Column two is labeled “Prismatic Metallics” that have “medium coverage, prismatic finish.” If they had omitted the larger, chunkier shimmer, I would have found these easier to work with as there was still some fallout when I used a dampened brush as well as when I blended it out. The pigmentation was medium, as described, and they should be used with a mixing medium for the adhesive quality (to deal with the chunky glitter) and improve the coverage/payoff. With the exception of #6, they were a challenge to use dry as there was a ton of fallout. With a dampened brush, most of them improved, but shades like #7 had to be used with an adhesive base/mixing medium as there were too many glitters. Without an adhesive base, there was fallout throughout the day. In most of the lead-up material, only column six was marketed as truly requiring the mixing medium, not column two, so I rated based on being able to use it dry but also tested and gave details on using it with a mixing medium.

Column three is labeled “Chromatic Foils” that have “full coverage, foil finish.” These are more like the types of shimmers one would expect from Viseart; they’re pigmented, smooth, blendable, and easy to work with. They don’t need to be applied with a dampened brush or fingertip to shine, but they can, of course, be intensified with a dampened brush like most shimmer/metallic powder eyeshadows.

Column four is labeled “Luxe Metallics” that have “full coverage, velvet finish.” (They were initially described as “medium to full,” which is why I swatched them dry and dampened with water.) This is another easy-to-use row of pigmented, blendable, and long-wearing shades. Some shades were slightly more “mostly opaque” rather than full coverage in a single layer, but in practice, I didn’t notice as they adhered evenly and blended out nicely to the point where it didn’t feel like they were under-pigmented.

Column five is labeled “Celestial Duo-Chromes” that have “sheer/medium coverage, dual reflective finish.” I actually felt that they were undersold; they were more medium to full coverage with none of the five shades being genuinely sheer (or even semi-sheer). The textures were soft, smooth, and blendable without being too softly nor too firmly pressed in the pan. They applied well and lasted for eight to nine hours on me.

Column six is labeled “Glittering Toppers” that have “medium/full coverage, glitter finish” and need to be used with a “mixing medium for best result.” I don’t like these personally; they were finicky to work with as the glitter particle size is quite large so while it’s drying down, there’s a very short period of time one can work with it to apply and blend but once it’s dry, if I went to blend, voila, fallout. I didn’t get great dispersion of glitter when I tried to use it on my lid. I find that the smaller, more fleck-like glitter/sparkle that we find in eyeshadows is often more reflective and sparkly yet easier to work with and wear during the day. The glitter in some of these shades just seemed to sit on top of the base but were so large (and not concentrated enough) that they lacked the wow factor I’d expect from adding glitter onto anything. This was most apparent in shade #30.

A few were sheerer when used dry, but as soon as I used it with a mixing medium, they became quite opaque and rich that I’m not sure how they’re working as “toppers” since they’re covering up the color/finish of anything they’re put on top of. However, using them dry was just a no; they had a lot of fallout during application and unsurprisingly, that larger glitter had nowhere to go but down during wear. The palette was designed for pros in mind, and Viseart has a long history of being a professional brand, so I’d definitely be curious to hear from makeup artists and how the “Glittering Toppers” are working for them in their kits. I tested these with and without the mixing medium but as they were marketed as to be used with mixing medium, the rating is based on application and wear with it (but I wanted to account for the base color and how it wore/applied, which is why I tested both ways).",B+
NARS,BLACKHEART,Lipstick,"a deep, blackened purple with a matte-metallic finish–flat and matte but with a metallic sheen (no glossiness). The color appeared more black than purple until put against true black hues, then it looked decidedly plummy! The texture was lightweight, thin without being watery, and spread easily across my lips. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and dried down without emphasizing my lip texture too much (in the close-up photos, I can see it emphasizing my very deep lip lines on the center of my lower lip but couldn’t detect this in person). The dry down left it mostly transfer-resistant, but there was a bit of tackiness present if I pressed my lips together though no color lifted away. It wore well for five hours and was non-drying.
",A-
NARS,COMBAT,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark plum with cooler pink and violet pearl. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single, fluid layer, which applied evenly and smoothly over my lips. The texture was slightly creamier than other shades, and it took longer to dry down; even after it seemed to do the bulk of its drying down, it had a touch of shine, in additional to the metallic finish. The liquid lipstick remained tacky when I pressed my lips together but did not lift any color away, and it did not slide or move around. It stayed on well for six hours, left a faint stain behind, and was neither drying nor hydrating.
",A
DIOR,POISON MATTE (962),Blush,"a bright plum with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque color payoff in a single layer with a smooth, lightly powdery texture that was dense but not firm or stiff to work with. It applied fairly evenly to bare skin and blended along the edges, though I noticed that it tended to look lighter and pinker when worn at sheerer coverage levels (less true-to-pan) so keep that in mind based on skin tone and what level of coverage you tend to wear your blush at. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before fading slightly.",B+
NARS,DOLCE VITA AND CAPRI,Palette,"a pinky-beige highlighter and a reddened-plum blush, and both shades are available individually within NARS’ permanent range. They performed consistently with the full-sized, individually-sold versions I last tried, so I think it’s a good way to enjoy both products without having to spend much–two shades for less than the cost of one! They’re by no means tiny, so one should get plenty of use out of each (frankly, the highlighter formula at full-size is massive!).

A full-sized blush retails for $30.00 and contains 0.16 oz. or costs $187.50/oz. A full-sized Highlighting Powder retails for $38.00 and contains 0.49 oz. or costs $77.55/oz. This set contains $22.50 worth of blush and $10.86 worth of highlighter for a total value of $33.36.

This set is exclusive to NARS (available now) and Ulta (available 10/14).",A-
ANASTASIA,HOLIDAY 2018,Palette,"a new, limited edition trio that features the brand’s signature liquid lipstick but with a metallic finish. Per the brand, they are supposed to have the “full-pigment” of their standard formula, but I found that Blizzard was rather sheer, while Phantom had better coverage it wasn’t quite opaque. The brand’s full-sized liquid lipstick retails for $20.00 and contains 0.11 oz., which gives the set a value of $43.64.",B
BOBBI BROWN,PINK GLOW,Highlighter,"a soft, pinky-peach with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. It had good pigmentation but was significantly lighter than the full-sized version I have, which may have been owed to the fact that the pan itself was dominated by the pale gold/white base with little of the rose/copper coloring. The powder had a smooth, almost velvety texture that was denser but not stiff or difficult to work with. It applied evenly to bare skin and blended out with little effort. I found the mini’s texture to be more flattering on my skin as it did not emphasize my skin’s natural texture. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.

The full-sized version retails for $48.00 and contains 0.28 oz. The mini contains $24.00 worth of product.",A-
URBAN DECAY,NAKED CHERRY,Palette,"the newest in the Naked series and features a mix of corals and plums. The formula across both the shimmers and mattes seemed drier; the mattes were thinner and drier, often on the powdery side and needed to be built up more, while the shimmers looked less shimmery once they were applied and blended out on my lid. The impact of some of the shimmers losing their reflective quality was that a lot of them ended up looking too similar on my lid, so the resulting looks were more prone to looking a little muddy.
",B-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,TOPAZ FLASH,Eyeshadow,"a smoldering, medium-dark taupe with subtle, war, reddish undertones and multi-colored glitter and sparkle. It had rich, opaque pigmentation with larger glitter particles with a mix of smaller sparkle and glitter. The texture was loosely pressed with a soft feel with some chunkiness coming through from amount of glitter in the product itself. With a flat, synthetic brush, the eyeshadow applied well with pressing motions, and I was surprised at how little fallout there was but did find that a little went a long way so using less than I thought I needed seemed to help with minimizing fallout. It wore well for nine hours before creasing faintly, and there was slight fallout over time.",B+
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,GLAMETHYST,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark purple with warm undertones and a glittery finish with multi-colored sparkles and larger glitters. It had a loosely-pressed consistency that was soft and yielding, so it was key to use the included presser to flatten and smooth out the surface prior to using to avoid over-applying product as a little went a long way. It was quite pigmented and applied with minimal fallout when pressed and gently patted onto the lid. The texture of this shade felt slightly drier compared to the other five I tried in the range. It lasted well for eight hours with slight fallout over time (impressive with how little given the glitter amount, though).",B+
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,GLAM NOIR,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark black with neutral undertones and mostly silver glitter and sparkles, though some seemed to flash almost bluish/teal at times. The consistency was soft, loosely pressed, but dense enough that it seemed to have more base pigment/payoff and not quite as much of the larger glitter particles as some of the other shades. As a result, it wasn’t quite as sparkly compared to the other shades, and when I used it with a small crease brush, I was able to use it in my crease a darkening shade with very little fallout. For application on the lid, it applied best with a pressing motion, which yielded opaque coverage and just a touch of fallout. It stayed on nicely for eight and a half hours before creasing faintly, and there was a smidgen of fallout over time.",A-
NARS,RITA AND MONA,Palette,"two richly pigmented, creamy, and long-wearing reds for the holidays. Each shade is available individually at full-size, as they are both part of the permanent range. They both performed consistently with their full-sized counterparts.

A full-sized Audacious Lipstick retails for $34.00 and contains 0.14 oz. or costs $242.86/oz. This set contains 0.16 oz. or $38.86 worth of product.

This set is exclusive to NARS (available now) and Ulta (available 10/14).",A
DIOR,MISS (047),Blush,"a medium pink with warmer undertones and a mostly matte finish. There were faint micro-sparkles strewn throughout, but they did not seem to be visible on my skin. The texture was velvety, slightly denser and firmer in the pan, but then applied in a way that felt somewhat powdery on my skin. It had good pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage with less than half of a layer, but the denser texture made it easier to pick up less on a brush, too, so sheerer coverage could be achieved by using a lighter hand. The blush applied unevenly to my skin, and it took more effort to diffuse and blend out the color so it was mostly even. On me, it lasted well for eight hours before fading a bit.",B-
NATASHA DENONA,GOLD,Palette,"a new, permanent palette that features an assortment of gold-inspired shades. The palette is divided into cooler, warmer, and more neutral undertones, though I’d still say it’s a very warm-toned, yellow-toned palette overall. The “coolness” really comes in through the two teal shades in the palette, and then two of the “gold” shimmers have green leanings. I think that the depths and undertones of the mattes make it more diverse in practice than it may initially appear at a glance, but I know I would have loved to see a bit more diversity or more inclusion of gold, as it’s more bronze/brown to me. I’d love to have some cooler or olive-toned golds (almost like antique pewter or tarnished gold or platinum) in the palette. The majority of the eyeshadows performed as marketed–pigmented, blendable, and long-wearing–though there are two glittery shades that are better as layering/top coat type shades (intentionally so) which may not be everyone’s cup of tea.
",A-
NARS,HIGH VOLTAGE,Palette,"three, warm-toned powder highlighters with a soft pink, gold, and peachy-copper. The performance was consistent with the full-sized highlighting powders that NARS released earlier this year with one shade (Fort de France) being from the permanent range, while the other two shades are new.

NARS’ highlighting powders retail for $38.00 and contain 0.49 oz. or cost $77.55/oz. This palette contains $37.22 worth of product, though two shades are exclusive to this palette. Alternatively, given the higher price point of the individual highlighters, getting three shades for about the price of one single shade may give it more value to some.",A
NARS,SHEENA,Lipstick,"a muted, medium coral with warm undertones and a satin sheen. The pigmentation was fantastic with rich, opaque color coverage delivered in a single layer. The color applied evenly without dragging, as the lipstick had a lightly creamy texture that was smooth without being too emollient or slippery. It stayed on well for five hours and was lightly hydrating while worn.

This shade is exclusive to Nordstrom and will be available October 18th.",A+
NARS,SIOUXSIE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark burgundy with subtle, cool red undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a moderately emollient consistency that had a tendency to slide on my lips for the first two hours of wear. After some of the shine wore down, it seemed to adhere better to my lips. The color went on fairly evenly, especially given the texture, but it was nowhere near as impressive as most of the Audacious range has been. The lipstick lasted nicely on my lips for six hours, left a faint stain behind, and was lightly moisturizing. I didn’t experience any feathering or bleeding with this shade.

This shade is exclusive to Sephora and will be available October 8th.",B+
NARS,NANCY,Lipstick,"a blackened purple with subtle, warm pink undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single, fluid layer that adhered evenly and smoothly across my lips without emphasizing my lip lines. It had a lightly creamy, moderately emollient consistency–it felt more slippery than the average Audacious Lipstick has to me–but it managed to go on evenly. This shade stayed on well for six and a half hours and felt less high-maintenance after an hour or so of wear (or, pro tip, blot lightly after initial application). The formula felt lightly hydrating over time and did not experience any feathering or bleeding while worn.
",A
TOO FACED,GINGERBREAD SPICE,Palette,"a new, limited edition eyeshadow palette with a mix of warmer neutrals with a slightly pinker, rosier leaning across mattes, shimmers, and more glittery/sparkly shades. I was impressed by the palette–it was a good balance of mattes and shimmers, light and mid-tone shades (I could have gone with one or two deeper shades), and offered a variety of possible looks. The quality was good overall with only one shade being harder to work with (Frostbite Me, which was more like a layering, glittery eyeshadow) and a few of the mattes needing to be built up to get full coverage (which is very workable for most people).

I didn’t get much gingerbread-esque scent–more like a sweet, vanilla but it was less noticeable compared to some of the brand’s past scented products. I didn’t notice the scent once the eyeshadows were applied to my eyes.
",A-
ANASTASIA,HOLIDAY 2018,Palette,"our, limited edition (and new) shades that are supposed to have the brand’s “full-sparkle formula,” which is really just code for shimmery, sparkly gloss with less coverage from color and more shimmer-related coverage. All four shades were moderately sparkly, and as they wore down, I could feel the texture of the sparkles come through, so if that’s a deal-breaker, keep that in mind. I actually enjoyed the glosses, but as someone who likes to layer shimmery glosses over more opaque lip color. The brand’s full-sized lip gloss retails for $16.00 and contains 0.16 oz., which gives the set a value of $28.00. The set will be online at retailers on October 9th and in stores on October 12th.

I wonder if there was an oversight in the text on the packaging, as these are marketed online to have a “mirror-like glossy finish with a sparkle effect” (and stripping the description of them as opaque/full coverage) and the brand’s swatches reflect a sheerer base formula, but the back of the box actually states “opaque, high-shine, vanilla-scented lip color.” (One shade is described as having a “clear base”! Two have “opalecsent” bases, which seem to refer to the milky quality of them, I guess…) I normally defer to the point of purchase for descriptions, so I will defer to what’s listed online but wanted to point out the discrepancy.",B+
BOBBI BROWN,BRONZE,Highlighter,"a brighter, coppery gold with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. This is, of course, with the product swirled together, which is the practical way to use the product in the mini size (even small eye brushes are tedious given how narrow each strip is!). If you’re someone who tends to use their Shimmer Bricks as cheek highlighters and as individual eyeshadows, stick with the full-sized version. If you’re someone who just uses it as a highlighter, the mini is a nice way to save a bit of money as there is still a good amount of product that will take a good while to use up. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied evenly to bare skin and blended out with ease. The consistency was dense, lightly creamy, and smooth to the touch. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.

The full-sized version retails for $48.00 and contains 0.40 oz. of product. The mini version contains $16.80 worth of product, so it is only a better “value” for those who rarely, if ever, finish their products–it’s not unusual for minis to cost more per ounce than full-sized. The color and quality of the mini was consistent with the last version of this shade I tried (in a palette).",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,FLASHLIGHT,Eyeshadow,"a bright white with subtle, warm undertones and flecks of silver and white sparkle and glitter. This shade had the chunkiest consistency out of the six that I tried and seemed to have less of a more finely-milled base, as it seemed translucent and just jam-packed with sparkle/glitter. It had nearly opaque “coverage” as there was so much glitter in a single layer. This was one of the few shades that would also work well layered over a slew of other products without altering the color of products under it. I used a flat, synthetic brush to press it onto my inner tearduct and saw a very brightening, shiny effect that was less glittery than anticipated (based on the texture) but still “dazzling” as intended. It had slight fallout during application and later on as I wore it, but it wasn’t enough that it became noticeable or distracting underneath my eye. The product lasted well for eight and a half hours on me.",B
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,GLEAM GIRL,Eyeshadow,"a peachy brown base with finer gold sparkle and larger, gold glitter. It had rich color payoff in a single layer where a little went a long way The consistency was soft, loosely pressed (as expected), and had a smoother base powder and more refined shimmer/sparkle with only a light amount of larger glitter particles. This particular shade had a very shiny, metallic finish on the skin. It had a touch of fallout during application, and there was a very slight additional amount over eight and a half hours (after which, it showed signs of faint creasing).",A-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,COPPERAZI,Eyeshadow,"a rich copper with warm, red undertones and a sparkling, gold and pink glitter over a metallic sheen. This was one of the more complex shade as the distinctive colors of sparkle paired with the more brightening, metallic finish caught the light particularly well. It had rich coverage in a single layer with a fairly smooth base but some texture came through from all of the sparkle/glitter. I applied this to my lid by using a flat, synthetic brush and gentle pressing/pushing motions and the eyeshadow adhered well with very, very little fallout. It wore well for eight and a half hours before creasing faintly with slight fallout over time.",A-
TOO FACED,GINGERBREAD MAN,Lipstick,"a deep copper with warm, red undertones and a matte finish. The color payoff was opaque in a single layer, which applied evenly and fluidly across my lips. The consistency was lightweight, fluid without being thin or watery, but it took a bit longer to dry down and it appeared slightly “cracked” along my deeper lip lines (I don’t think it was noticeable from a normal viewing distance). This shade stayed on well for over six hours and was neither drying nor hydrating over time, and it came through a meal looking fairly intact but could break down more noticeably with a very oily meal. This particular shade has a slightly sweet, spicy scent (no taste).",A
TOO FACED,GINGERBREAD GIRL,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark red with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had rich, opaque color coverage in a single layer that spread evenly across my lips and didn’t sit noticeably in my lip lines (though it didn’t hide them either!). The consistency was lightweight, thin without being watery, and smooth, and I didn’t find it difficult to maneuver it along the edges of my lips. It was transfer-proof after a few minutes of letting it fully dry down, though it was mostly set within a minute of application and could make it through a meal mostly intact (assuming one isn’t eating anything super oily!). It wore well for over six hours, left a faint stain behind, and was non-drying. This particular shade has a slightly sweet, spicy scent (no taste).",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,GILTY,Highlighter,"a light-medium, peachy gold with warm, rosy undertones and a metallic sheen. The consistency was smooth, lightly creamy, and finely-milled, which made it easy to pick up with a brush and to blend out on my skin. The slight ridges of the powder made the surface not quite as even, and I found that a soft swirl and press of my brush picked up product the most evenly until those ridges smoothed out (after a few uses). It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly to bare skin and yielded both color (on my complexion, about light to light-medium) and a strong, golden glow. It seemed to emphasize my skin’s natural texture just slightly when worn at semi-opaque or higher coverage. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before fading noticeably. Also, it is an over-sized highlighter, which was the brand’s goal as they stated it was for “face and all-over body use.”
",A-
ANASTASIA,SULTRY,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette for the holiday season that contains 14 shades across matte and metallic finishes. The performance was fairly consistent across the palette with no real duds; the most troublesome shade was Dystopian and more because it had a tendency to go gray and wasn’t a blendable as other mattes in the palette. Most of the shimmers were soft, lightly creamy but not so dense that they needed to be used with a dampened brush to look shiny. The palette will be online at retailers on October 9th and in stores on October 12th.",A
PAT MCGRATH,DARK DEVOTION,Lipstick,"a medium-dark berry with cool undertones and a natural sheen. It had a lightweight, thinner consistency that was smooth and lightly emollient but not slippery on my lips. It had sheer coverage, which didn’t apply as evenly as I would have liked it to have, as it made areas of my lips look deeper than others. This shade lasted well for four hours, had a bit of a stain left behind, and was moisturizing to wear.",B
PAT MCGRATH,ULTRA VIXEN,Lipstick,"a medium-dark plum with subtle, warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had medium pigmentation in one layer, which applied evenly and smoothly across my lips without tugging. The texture was smooth, lightweight, and creamy enough to glide on but thin to prevent it from feeling slippery on. It wore well for four and a half hours and was hydrating to wear.",A-
PAT MCGRATH,FLESH 3,Lipstick,"a medium plum with strong, warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had medium pigmentation in a single layer that was buildable to semi-opaque coverage–this was one of the more pigmented shades in the range, which may be a happy “downside” for some. The lip balm felt smooth and glided easily across my lips but didn’t feel overly slippery or “wet” when applied, so it stayed in place well for four hours. The formula was moisturizing while worn.",A-
DIOR,999,Blush,"a rich coral-red with warm undertones and cooler, pink pearl that gives it a luminous sheen when applied to the skin. The consistency was smooth, dense but not stiff, and velvety to the touch, so it picked up easily with a brush and could be used with a lighter hand for sheerer coverage or a moderate hand for more opaque coverage. A little went a long way with this shade, though, so I highly recommend using less than you anticipate and building up as needed for the desired effect. I was so pleased that the intense blush color blended out easily along the edges, while the glowing finish looked skin-like without being overtly shimmery. It wore well for almost nine hours before it started to show signs of fading.",A+
BECCA COSMETICS,BERLIN GIRL GLOW,Highlighter,"a soft, peachy, beige base with a pink-to-blue shifting pearl. The consistency was soft, blendable, and finely-milled, which helped my brush pick up product evenly and distribute it to my cheekbones with ease. I had no trouble diffusing and spreading the highlighter on my skin for a moderate glow. It added subtle warmth and shine, and when I tilted my head or moved slightly, I caught the bluish sheen that reflected off of my cheekbones. It had opaque pigmentation that lasted well for eight and a half hours on me. It is a limited edition shade but is still in stock at Becca when I checked at the writing of this review!
",A
HUDA BEAUTY,RUBY,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette that featured an assortment of pink/red-based shades from pale pink to plum to coral. The matte formula was thinner and drier to the touch but often performed fine on the lid (blendable, buildable, not prone to fading or fallout), while the shimmer formula was denser and thicker with a more silicone-based texture so they worked better with synthetic brushes and pushing/pressing motions both in the pan and on the lid (this is my experience with most silicone-heavy formulas). If you tend to have a very light hand, you may not find your technique picks up product as well with the shimmers.

PAT MCGRATH,PASSION FLOWER,Lipstick,"a medium pink with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It appeared like a lighter, peachy-coral in the tube, but it was significantly pinker swatched as well as on, and it left a strong, pink stain behind (on my arm as well as my lips). It had semi-sheer pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips. It had a lightweight consistency that was lightly creamy but not thin or too slippery on my lips, though it wasn’t as smoothing as other shades in the range. The color stayed on well for four hours and was hydrating while I wore it.",B+
PAT MCGRATH,FULL FANTASY,Lipstick,"a medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-sheer color coverage in a single layer, which applied fairly evenly on my bottom lip but didn’t seem to adhere as evenly to my upper lip. The texture was lightly creamy, thin but not clingy, and comfortable to wear. It wore well for four and a half hours on me, left a slight stain behind, and was moisturizing over time.",B+
PAT MCGRATH,WILD CHERRY,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, raspberry pink with subtle, cool undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-sheer pigmentation that applied fairly evenly across my lips. The texture was lightweight, thin without benig clingy, and had a light creaminess to it that helped it glide across my lips with ease but not enough that it felt slippery on my lips while worn. It stayed on well for four and a half hours and left a very faint stain behind. The formula felt hydrating over time.",A-
NARS,HOT TRYST,Palette,"six cheek colors–two seem more like highlighters, while the remaining four seem like blushes. Each shade was a good size to accommodate most cheek brushes (both blush and highlighting brushes). The formula more like a hybrid gel-powder or baked product–denser and firmer to the touch, so no powderiness, but still yielding enough to be easily used with brushes; the formula reminded me of the brand’s own Dual Intensity blushes but a bit softer. All six shades performed similarly semi-opaque to opaque coverage, blendable, and long-wearing. This palette is available at NARS today, and then it will launch at Sephora on October 8th.

Updated 10/4 at 10:30AM PST: As the product went live this morning, I was able to read about the formula, and it is one, a wet/dry formula, so the shades can be used with a dampened brush for greater glow and depth (which I tested for, thankfully, based on prior experiences with this type of texture!). They do intensify–both in terms of becoming a bit more shimmery/shiny and also have truer-to-pan color on the more mid-tone shades, though none of them need to be applied damp to get yield coverage/luminosity.

Secondly, NARS described the formula as having “soft, buildable” coverage as well as “buildable radiance.” Under “how to use,” they recommend applying it dry for sheerer coverage and wet for more intense coverage and glow. Again, most of them were rather pigmented dry, but I’ve updated the ratings to reflect the buildable quality of the coverage (which almost just flipped some of the ratings around).",A
DOSE OF COLORS ,FRIENDCATION,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette that includes 10 shades across an assortment of mattes and sparkling, metallic hues. Per the brand, the matte shades are “rich with pgiment and blend like a dream” while the shimmer shades have a “glistening finish” that is best applied “with a finger” if one wants “intense color payoff” or used with “your preferred brush” if one wants “softer coverage.” The mattes were quite pigmented and blendable, which made them easy to use overall. The shimmery shades were fairly pigmented when applied and used with a dry brush, but applying with fingertips definitely intensified the coverage noticeably, though I felt that I could get a similar intensity by using a dampened brush as well. The latter is a good way to apply the sparkly shades if you’re using an adhesive spray/mixing medium, as that will help to lock on the sparkles better than the formula does on its own. There was slight to light fallout depending on the shade but definitely not so severe that it looked amiss from a normal viewing distance.
",A-
DOSE OF COLORS ,AFTERMATH,Lipstick,"a medium, copper-brown with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had opaque color coverage in a single layer, though the consistency was denser and firmer, so it tugged a bit during application but was workable–just not the creamiest or most comfortable to use. The lipstick felt lightweight on and didn’t feel drying while worn, which was a nice surprise. It wore well for five and a half hours.",A-
DOSE OF COLORS ,HEY GIRL,Lipstick,"a medium-dark peach with soft, warm undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was good with full color coverage in one layer that applied evenly, though it separated slightly along m y lip lines (but wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance). The lipstick was smooth, dense, and firmer, so it did tug on my lips while I applied it but not quite to the point where it was painful or difficult to apply. It lasted nicely for four and a half hours and was non-drying over time.",B+
DOSE OF COLORS ,THE MOST,Lipgloss,"a clear base with iridescent, cooler sparkle and pearl with a glossy, shiny finish. (It was intended to be a clear gloss with shimmer/sparkle.) It had a semi-sheer to medium-level of “coverage” from the shimmer, and the sparkles spread evenly across my lips, while the gloss itself helped my lips appear smoother and plumper by de-emphasizing my lip lines and lip texture. The gloss was smooth, mostly non-sticky, and light-medium in thickness, so I could feel a bit of the sparkle as the gloss wore down. It lasted for three hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",A-
DOSE OF COLORS ,CHASING THE SUN,Highlighter,"a medium copper with warm, golden shimmer and a reddish-brown undertone. The consistency was soft, smooth, and lightly creamy with a more emollient base that seemed to give it a smoother appearance (and didn’t emphasize my skin’s natural texture) when applied to my skin. It applied best with a moderately dense brush to buff it into my skin for the most even application. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me.
",A-
NARS,VIRGIN GORDA,Eyeshadow,"a medium peach with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had excellent pigmentation with a smooth, lightly creamy texture that wasn’t too dense nor too soft in the pan, so it applied without fallout but still blended out easily. The color stayed on well for eight hours on me.",A
NARS,GUAYAQUIL,Eyeshadow,"a deep, coppery brown with warm undertones and a satin sheen. It had opaque color payoff paired with a smooth texture that wasn’t too firmly nor too softly pressed in the pan, so it picked up easily with a brush and adhered well to bare skin without fallout. It wore well for eight and a half hours before fading on me.",A
NARS,GALAPAGOS,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark brown with warmer, reddish undertones and flecks of gold micro-sparkle. It was easier to work with and keep some of the sparkles on my lid in the Hardwired formula than the original, regular eyeshadow formula that came before it. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with less richness applied with a dry brush, whereas dampened application yielded opaque coverage and a smoother application with better adherence of the sparkles as well. It lasted nicely for eight hours with slight fallout when I used it damp and moderate fallout when I used it dry.
",B
NARS,BENGALI,Eyeshadow,"a medium, taupe-brown with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a soft, velvety texture that was smooth without being powdery, which helped it sit well on my skin and blend out with little effort. It wore well for eight hours before fading noticeably on me.",A-
NARS,ORGASM AND ORGASM,Palette,"a travel-sized blush and lipstick. Both shades are available in the permanent range; I found the blush was drier and stiffer than previous iterations I’ve tried, while the lipstick was consistent with past experiences. This set is exclusive to Sephora and launches October 8th. The set contains $22.50 worth of blush and $11.67 worth of lipstick for a total value of $34.17.",B-
PAT MCGRATH,SUCCEXY,Lipstick,"a medium coral with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-sheer pigmentation that applied fairly evenly across my lips, but it seemed to enhance the unevenness present in my natural lip color so it did not look as even (but I think that the product itself was even). The consistency was lightweight, lightly creamy, thin without being clingy, and comfortable to apply and to wear. It lasted well for three and a half hours and was hydrating over time.
",B+
PAT MCGRATH,LOVE SUPREME,Lipstick,"a soft, light-medium pink with subtle, warm undertones a fine, dusting of gold micro-shimmer. The consistency was smooth, lightly creamy without feeling “wet” or too slippery on my lips, yet it wasn’t tacky and sat well on my lips without getting into my lip lines. The color coverage was sheer, as anticipated, and applied evenly across my lips. It stayed on well for three hours and was hydrating while worn",A-
PAT MCGRATH,BLOW UP,Lipstick,"a soft, peachy coral with warm undertones and a soft, natural sheen. It had sheer to semi-sheer coverage with a noticeable warmth and tint added to my lips. The color applied evenly and didn’t emphasize my lip lines. The texture was lightweight, smooth, and lightly creamy without being slippery, but it also didn’t feel too thin. It felt smoother without the wetness often associated with more balm-like products. It wore well for three hours and was moisturizing to wear over time.",A-
BECCA COSMETICS,MACARON COLLECTION,Palette,"four, miniature-sized highlighters. All four shades have been released before and are currently available to be purchased individually, though Prismatic Amethyst is a limited edition shade. I found that the quality and texture of the minis in this set was comparable to the full-sized versions I have of all but Opal, as my original Opal has a creamier, smoother consistency (and generally, I have found most of the newer Becca highlighters to have a less cream-like feel, though they still function and perform similarly). A full-sized highlighter retails for $38.00 and contains 0.28 oz. or costs $135.71/oz., which means the set contains $46.14 worth of highlighter. Unless you’re the kind of person who finishes up products or sticks with one shade at a time, I think the set is a great way to try four different shades for a little more than the cost of one single shade.
",A
NARS,ISLA BONITA,Eyeshadow,"a very pale green–almost like a green-tinged white–with a metallic sheen. It had good pigmentation with a soft, blendable texture that wasn’t too firmly nor too softly pressed in the pan. It applied well to bare skin and wore well for eight hours before fading noticeably.",A-
NARS,ECSTASY,Eyeshadow,"a pale, minty green base with flecks of gold, green, and copper sparkle and micro-glitter. It looked more interesting in the pan and swatched than on my eye, where it looked more like a pale green with warmer undertones. The texture was drier to the touch and was more loosely pressed, so there was some excess product kicked up when it was used with a dry brush, and then there was some fallout during application unless I was very careful to press and push it onto my lid. It was much easier to use it with a dampened brush, as the product applied more evenly without fallout. It had medium, buildable pigmentation regardless of application method but a dampened brush built up the color faster. The color stayed on well for six and a half hours and eight hours for dry and wet applications with moderate fallout worn dry and little fallout when worn wet.",C
NARS,GANGES,Eyeshadow,"a deep, green-leaning teal with a mostly matte finish and faint micro-sparkle strewn over it. The sparkles were just barely visible once applied to my lid, but it had a much denser, firmer consistency that was stiff and difficult to blend out… but more of the sparkles seemed to hold than softer, similarly-appearing shades (where the sparkles disappear). It had semi-opaque pigmentation that darkened a couple of shades after initial application. This shade lasted for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.",C
NARS,NIGHT PORTER,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark green with warmer undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage, but the texture was firmer and thinner, which resulted in a product that was stiffer and more challenging to work with as it did not diffuse and blend out easily along the edges. It did improve over an eyeshadow primer, which seemed to help it apply more evenly. On me, it wore well for seven and a half hours.",B-
NARS,NIGHT BREED,Eyeshadow,"a medium, matte black with silver sparkle on top. The texture was drier, slightly powdery in the pan, and this resulted in the sparkles disappearing or dropping off the lid during application, so it performed more like a matte finish than a sparkly one. It took more effort to diffuse the edges seamlessly as it tended to look a bit ragged initially. This shade lasted for seven and a half hours on me before fading noticeably (but did not seem to have fallout due to the sparkles not transferring well!).",B-
HUDA BEAUTY,TOPAZ,Palette,"more of a mixed bag than I’d expect these types of shades to be, since we have certainly seen numerous orange/copper/red-themed shades over the last few years. The matte formula was noticeably drier, though actual application showed them to be rather pigmented and easy to use, so while they felt one way, it only seemed to inhibit the wear a bit. The shimmer formula seems denser and creamier to the touch, but then is harder to apply with dry brushes like a traditional eyeshadow due to the additional slip.",B
DOSE OF COLORS ,A MAUVE STORY,Lipstick,"a medium, dusty pink with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had rich pigmentation in a single layer, which applied evenly and spread easily across my lips. The consistency was lightweight, thin, and fluid with an oilier feel (felt more slippery than if it was creamy), but then it dried down to a satin to semi-matte finish that no longer felt creamy/oily and did not slide or move around. It wasn’t transfer-proof and would come off blotted on a napkin but was more resistant to transferring on cups and glasses. The color did separate at my deeper lip lines slightly, though it wasn’t enough to be noticeable from a normal viewing distance. It lasted well for five hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.
",A-
DOSE OF COLORS ,MY MAIN,Lipstick,"a light-medium, peachy brown with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had a thin, oily texture that applied evenly and fluidly across my lips for even, opaque coverage in a single layer. It dried down after about 30 seconds and no longer seemed oily/creamy, but the dry down doesn’t make it transfer-proof but was more resistant to transferring on cups and glasses. It separated a bit at my deeper lip lines, though it wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance. It wore well for five and a half hours and was non-drying.",A
URBAN DECAY,HEX REMEDY,Palette,"a new, limited edition five-piece eyeliner set. I’m a fan of Urban Decay’s pencil formula (I keep all shades out on my vanity!), and Perversion has a go-to whenever I’m looking for a black eyeliner for years. I’d love to see a shade like Space Dust added to their permanent offerings as it’s not the most common shade. I wish Voodoo performed better, but the other four were fairly good.

The set includes $78.75 worth of eyeliner as the full-sized eye pencils retail for $21.00 and include 0.04 oz., which makes this set a great value if more than two shades appeal to you!",A-
BECCA COSMETICS,SPANISH ROSE GLOW,Highlighter,"a light-medium, yellow-peach base with iridescent pink and pink-to-gold shifting sparkle and finer pearl. It gave me subtle warmth and cooler, a more luminous pink sheen when the light caught my cheekbones. It had good pigmentation in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with less than half of a layer more, or diffused for sheerer coverage if preferred. The texture was soft, slightly drier to the touch, but very blendable and sat well on my skin without emphasizing my skin’s natural texture. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before fading slightly.",A-
HUDA BEAUTY,AMETHYST,Palette,"a new, limited edition purple-themed palette with mostly pinker/redder plums and purples across a mix of matte and shimmer finishes. It was a mixed bag and is a palette that needs an eyeshadow primer underneath and/or a dampened brush with some of the shimmers.",B+
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,SHINE A LIGHT,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark gold with warmer, yellow undertones and pink and gold flecks of shimmer and larger sparkle. If you dig medium, sparkly glosses, I’m sure you’ll find little to fault this shade for, but it was advertised as having “maximum coverage and brilliance.” The coverage was medium–plenty of my natural lip color came through–with a sheer to medium level of coverage in the vein of shimmer/sparkle. The consistency was smooth, lightly creamy, and non-sticky, which made it comfortable and plush to wear but there was enough larger sparkle that those more sensitive to feeling those particles may find the base is not thick enough to avoid the textural element the sparkle brought to the party. (I didn’t find it rough or gritty but find my ability to detect that seems to be weaker than others.) It stayed out of most of my lip lines, despite the lighter base color. It wore well for four and a half hours on me and was hydrating over time.",B
BITE BEAUTY,LIBRA,Lipstick,"a deep, chocolatly brown with warm, yellowish undertones and a satin finish. It had opaque pigmentation in a single stroke, which was as marketed, and the color applied evenly and smoothly across my lips without dragging on them. The consistency dense, lightly creamy, and had a touch of tackiness. It wore well for six hours and was moisturizing while worn.

",A+
ESTEE LAUDER,SOLAR CRUSH,Highlighter,"a medium, coppery bronze with warm undertones and a golden, metallic sheen. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, though the denser, smooth texture made it easier to just pick up less (with a feathery brush or lighter hand). The highlighter applied evenly to bare skin and blended out with ease. It sat well on my skin and didn’t emphasize my skin’s natural texture. This shade lasted well for eight and a half hours on me before fading slightyl.
",A
COLOUR POP,HEIGH-HO,Eyeshadow,"a sparkling white with subtle, warm undertones and cooler, blue and violet sparkle. It had medium coverage, which was somewhat buildable, but it was more of a brightening or layering shade–it was quite sparkly, so I didn’t notice the sheerness when used on the lid or inner tearduct. The texture was plush, lightly creamy, and noticeably sparkly (so it wasn’t perfectly smooth). It wore well for nine hours with very little fallout and no creasing or fading.",B+
COLOUR POP,UNDER THE SEA,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium green with subtle, warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that did not build up well, but it applied surprisingly evenly for the color and coverage level. The consistency felt smooth, spongy and emollient without being too slippery. The eyeshadow adhered well to my lid and lasted for 10 hours without fading or creasing.",A
COLOUR POP,A SMILE AND A SONG,Highlighter,"a soft, light gold with warm, yellow undertones and a shiny, metallic finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage when applied with fingertips, while more medium, buildable coverage was achievable by using a stippling brush to apply. I had no trouble applying the highlighter on bare skin or over liquid foundation (even when set with powder) for a smooth, even application that didn’t disturb what was underneath it. The consistency was smooth, lightweight, and emollient without being too slippery or too wet. It dried down to a powder-like finish and stayed on well for 10 hours before fading slightly.",A
COLOUR POP,PART OF YOUR WORLD,Highlighter,"a soft, pale pink with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had opaque color coverage when applied with fingertips and more medium, buildable coverage when applied with a stippling brush (as described). It had a smooth consistency that was spongy, lightly emollient, and had noticeable slip–a smidgen more than the average shade I’ve tried in the formula. The highlighter applied evenly to bare skin, diffused easily, and also applied well over foundation (as it did not lift it ). It wore well for almost 10 hours before fading slightly on me.",A
COLOUR POP,IT'S A PRINCESS THING,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette that includes a mix of warmer neutrals from pale gold to blackened plum. The scheme seemed to fit the theme of the collection, so for those who are in need of a go-to neutral palette, this one could come in handy. There were no major misses in the palette with most shades performing well. The exterior of the palette has the sketches of the princesses, while the interior of the lid has their signatures (no mirror), so the collection’s artwork is featured on the actual packaging, not just the cardboard box, which is nice to see.",A-
COLOUR POP,JASMINE,Lipstick," a rich, vibrant fuchsia with cool, blue undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation–it was opaque in places and slightly under in other areas–that applied evenly across my lips in a fluid stroke. The lipstick had a lightly creamy texture that was lightweight and comfortable to wear, though there was a touch of product that gathered in my deeper lip lines. It wore well for six hours, left a stain behind, and was lightly hydrating over time.
",A
COLOUR POP,SNOW WHITE,Lipstick,"a deep, coppery-red with warm undertones and a cream finish. The consistency was smooth, lightly creamy, and comfortable to apply and to wear as it never tugged or dragged on me. There was enough slip to yield even, opaque coverage without any feathering or bleeding over time. I noticed a smidgen of product in my deeper lip lines in the close-up photo but couldn’t detect it in person. This shade stayed on well for six hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.",A
COLOUR POP,TIANA,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, reddish burgundy with subtle, cool undertones and a lightly glossy, cream finish. This shade had more slip and felt a bit “wetter” compared to the others in the collection, though I didn’t experience any feathering or bleeding personally. It had nearly opaque color payoff in a single layer, which applied evenly and smoothly across my lips. It lasted beautifully for six hours, left a very faint stain, and felt hydrating over time.
",A
CLINIQUE,GET CHEEKY,Palette,"a new, limited edition trio of blushes for the holiday season. The palette contains three full-sized Cheek Pops (which retail for $24.00 each), which gives the palette a total value of $72. All three shades are part of the permanent range, and thankfully, they performed very similarly to the permanent counterparts that I have (as singles). The downside is that the palette packaging seemed very thin, and the “hinge” of the palette is secured solely by the sticker/label that surrounds the plastic lid and base; I was able to rip off the lid by attempting to do so for about 15-20 seconds. If you like more satin-to-natural finishes in your blush, enjoy warmer-toned blushes, and don’t mind the utterly flimsy packaging, it’s a great way to try one of my favorite blush formulas!",A
TARTE,TARTEIST PRO REMIX,Palette,"for those who love metallics–it’s full of shimmer and color with three matte shades and the rest pretty much chocked full of shimmer. I’d consider it more of a complementary palette than a typical standalone palette (but that really depends on your need for mattes in a look). I loved all three looks that I created using just this palette alone, but they are shimmer-heavy, which I know is not everyone’s cup of tea. There are two matte shades–Wall Art and Mixed Media–that I don’t feel are necessary in such a shimmer/color heavy palette; the inclusion of a matte black worked particularly well to deepen other shades and really enhanced the color scheme. The inclusion of the other two mattes, though, seemed to take up space that could have gone to other pops of color, like a coral, mid-tone purple, or mid-tone, warmer green. The formula used in the shimmers reminded me a lot of the Tarteist Metallic line (but the shimmers in this palette are softer). Also, the palette smelled like vanilla for those who are more sensitive to scents.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,ALISTAIR,Lipstick,"a deep, pinky beige with warmer undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied decently but could have gone on more evenly, and it did pull into my lip lines.The texture was creamy with moderate slip, and it did feel like it was sliding around a bit over the three hours it stayed on for. The formula felt lightly hydrating while worn.",B-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,BRYAN,Lipstick,"a medium pink with warm undertones and fine, golden pearl. It had good color payoff in a single layer, which adhered evenly to my lips and didn’t gravitate toward my lip lines noticeably. The consistency was lightweight, moderately emollient, and comfortable to apply and to wear as the formula felt lightly hydrating. This shade wore well for four hours on me.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,DONOVAN,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark coppery brown with warm, red undertones and fine golden pearl. It had good pigmentation, nearly opaque, with a smooth, creamy consistency with noticeable slip but did not slide around much while worn. The lipstick lasted nicely for four and a half hours and was moisturizing while worn.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,GILT GLOW,Highlighter,"a pale, white gold with warmer undertones and a luminous sheen. It had a stronger, white base that looked almost pinkish when applied to my skin tone, though the warmer, golden shimmer strewn throughout warmed up the overall color. The texture was smooth, thin, and almost papery as it had a dryness present that was unexpected, yet it didn’t seem to impact performance or application as the powder sat beautifully on my skin and yielded a moderate glow. It had excellent pigmentation, picked up well with a brush, and went on evenly and blended out with little effort. It stayed on well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,AURORA,Palette,"a deep purple and deep gold. The formula is supposed to have “rich color pigments” that have a “creamy feel for ultra-fluid application” and can be used on the “lashline and waterline.” It’s a firmer, stiffer consistency used in these dual-ended pencils, which makes them less comfortable to use and more to tugging/dragging on my lash line. The pigmentation ranged from shade to shade, and some were more or less buildable than others. They had decent wear but I could not get these to apply well to my waterline–they just didn’t seem to transfer onto the waterline much.",D-
COLOUR POP,SO THIS IS LOVE,Eyeshadow,"a soft, lighter taupe with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation with a smooth lightly creamy texture that felt a bit wet to the touch but did not slide around on my skin. I didn’t have any trouble diffusing or blending out the edges. It stayed on well for 10 hours without fading or creasing.
",A
COLOUR POP,ALMOST THERE,Eyeshadow,"a deep brown with subtle, warm undertones paired with sparkling, metallic sheen. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, lightly emollient texture that was easy to apply and blend out without losing opacity (if desired). If I blended too much after it had dried down on my lid, some of the sparkles came loose. It wore well for 10 hours with slight fallout over time but no creasing or fading.",A
COLOUR POP,A WHOLE NEW WORLD,Eyeshadow,"a medium lavender with subtle, cool undertones and flecks of blue and lighter blue sparkle. It worked best as a layering shade on top of other eyeshadows or eyeliner as it was more medium in coverage and somewhat patchy, so it did not work that well on its own. The eyeshadow did, however, stay on well for 10 hours without creasing or fading and had minimal migration of sparkle over time.",C
COLOUR POP,BE OUR GUEST,Eyeshadow,"a medium pink with warmer undertones and cooler, iridescent pearl and faint sparkle. It had a drier consistency to the touch that did not seem to apply as evenly to my lid–somewhat patchy and difficult to maintain opaque coverage. It had opaque pigmentation if I applied it in a single layer and did not make any attempt to blend it out. It lasted for nine hours on me before fading noticeably.",B
NARS,ASHES TO ASHES,Eyeshadow,"a soft, golden taupe with warm undertones and a pearl finish. The texture was smooth, soft, and blendable without being powdery nor too firmly-pressed in the pan. It had good pigmentation that adhered well to bare skin. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.
",A-
NARS,SOPHIA,Eyeshadow,"a muted, light-medium taupe with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. The texture was soft, a smidgen dusty but very blendable without losing its intensity. It had rich color coverage in a single layer that lasted nicely for eight hours on me.",A-
NARS,NOUMEA,Eyeshadow,"a medium brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. The texture was smooth, silky, and blendable with a thinner texture that managed not to feel dry. The pigmentation was opaque and adhered evenly to bare skin. It stayed on well for eight hours on me.",A-
NARS,NEPAL,Eyeshadow,"a light brown with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a drier, dustier texture that did not sit as smoothly on my bare skin as other shades in the range have. It blended out easily but was hard to build up, even over primer. It wore well for seven hours on me.",C
COLOUR POP,BIBBIDI,Lipgloss,"a clear base with flecks of gold sparkle. It was intended to be clear, so the lack of coverage was completely as expected. The gloss had a smooth, plush texture that wasn’t tacky and was comfortable to wear. There was only a dusting of sparkle in the gloss, though, so it added more shine/glossiness (from the gloss itself) than shimmer or sparkle. It lasted for two and a half hours on me but was hydrating to wear.",B+
COLOUR POP,BOBBIDI,Lipgloss,"a soft, medium coral with warm undertones and a cream finish. It was supposed to have a “tint of sheer colour and ho shimmer,” which seemed accurate–it was glossy and lightly shiny with semi-sheer coverage. The gloss didn’t exacerbate my lip lines, but there was slight product that gathered in them. The color itself applied evenly, while the gloss was smooth, lightweight, and non-sticky. It wore well for three hours and was moisturizing while worn.",B+
COLOUR POP,BOO,Lipgloss,"a soft, medium rosy pink with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It was supposed to have a “tint of sheer colour and no shimmer,” but the pigmentation was more medium to semi-opaque coverage on me. It had a smooth, almost creamy consistency that was easy to apply and spread across my lips. The color applied fairly evenly and didn’t emphasize my deeper lip lines on my bottom lip, but I could see it like a spiderweb within my lip lines on my upper lip more noticeably. The gloss stayed on well for three and a half hours and was nicely hydrating.",B+
ESTEE LAUDER,HEAT WAVE,Highlighter,"a light-medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. It had a smooth, dense consistency that felt firmer but not in a stiff way, though you’ll want to use a moderately dense highlighting brush to achieve even application as I found very feathery brushes did not pick up product as well. (I find that this type of formula, which feels like a smoother, more refined baked powder, often describe as a hybrid formula, has this denseness/firmness.) The highlighter blended out nicely and didn’t emphasize my skin’s natural texture while still adding a lot of shine. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before fading noticeably. This shade’s “pink” rings seemed to dissipate after a use (swatched, applied, and tested after removing possible overlay/overspray).",A
HUDA BEAUTY,EMERALD,Palette,"a mix of warmer and cooler-toned greens across three matte shades and six shimmers. With the undertones in the palette, the bottom row doesn’t quite jive with the top six shades as cohesively as it could, and I think they could have put in a deeper, matte green for greater contrast (what I felt I was missing when I was trying to use the palette) instead of shade #9 at the very least. The texture of the shimmery shades is denser and thicker, more silicone-heavy, whereas the mattes were thin and drier (not as velvety as past mattes in their Obsessions palettes), so it’s key to apply the mattes earlier on as they don’t layer as well on top of the shimmery shades.",B+
HOURGLASS,UNLOCKED,Palette,"a new, limited edition holiday palette that features two Ambient Lighting Powders, one Ambient Lighting Bronzer, two Ambient Lighting Blushes, and one Metallic Strobe Lighting Powder. The upside to this year’s palette (in a way) is that the included shades are new rather than repeated from the permanent range. The palette contains $10.51 worth of Ambient Lighting Powder, $5.13 worth of Ambient Lighting Bronzer, $20.27 worth of Ambient Lighting Blush, and $9.50 worth of Metallic Strobe Lighting Powder for a total value of $45.41. I’m not sure why the Hourglass Ambient Lighting palettes are priced so much over the “value” in the palette (as usually palettes offer more value than purchasing alone).

I’d actually love to see Hourglass bring back trios for the holidays–maybe two or three (at least one for lighter skin, one for deeper skin) rather than attempting a one-size-fits-few kind of palette. I am not fair (I’d classify myself as light-medium) but found that the second Ambient Lighting Powder darkened my complexion noticeably if used all-over, so it was more suitable as a bronzer on me, so I found that it was a palette that seemed most suitable for medium to medium deep skin tones.",A-
COLOUR POP,ARIEL,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, peachy coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, lightly creamy texture that glided across my lips with ease and didn’t emphasize my lip lines. It wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A
COLOUR POP,BELLE,Lipstick,"a medium, rosy plum with warm undertones and a cream finish. The lipstick had opaque color payoff in a single layer, which adhered evenly and smoothly across my lips. It was lightly creamy with some slip initially, and there was a smidgen of product that gathered in my deeper lip lines, though it wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The lipstick stayed on well for five hours and was lightly moisturizing.",A
COLOUR POP,CINDERELLA,Lipstick,"a bright, medium cotton candy pink with cool, bluish undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque, but the texture was more prone to separating along my lip lines, even though there wasn’t anything notable about the feel of it going on that stood out. It was lightly creamy but not overly emollient, so it didn’t drag on my lips nor did it slide around while worn. It lasted well for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A
BECCA COSMETICS,GOLD LAVA,Highlighter,"a pure, yellow gold with a strong, metallic finish paired with a dusting of larger, pink flecks of sparkle. Unlike the typical gold highlighter that is often more peach- or orange-leaning, this ran much more yellow-based. That being said, Becca itself has released yellow-toned gold highlighters in the past, and it’s that pink sparkle that makes this particular shade a little different but the difference applied will be less and less as sheerer coverage levels. The consistency was smooth, blendable, and easy to work with, while the highlighter yielded opaque color payoff in a single layer that was easy to sheer out for softer coverage if preferred. It applied well to bare skin and didn’t emphasize my skin’s natural texture while still giving me a luminous sheen. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before fading a bit.",A
VISEART,LIBERTINE,Palette,"a new, permanent palette that’s exclusive to Beautylish. It contains five matte shades and four shimmer shades. Three of the five mattes are “sheer matte pigments,” which are marketed as a wet/dry formula. If you’re someone who wants to be able to use every shade easily in a palette and wants them to perform similarly to each other, I’d look at a different Viseart palette. If you’re into using your eyeshadows as eyeliners, you may appreciate the new finish/formula found in this particular palette. I highly recommend reading through the way the palette is supposed to be used before purchasing it to ensure that it will work for your application style.

I would expect that the brand and its creator would be the best to describe the formula of this palette, which is what I’m deferring to, but I do find that this palette is less consumer-friendly and more pro-friendly. Within the Libertine palette, one will find two new formulas, which are labeled as pigments and are specifically “not” creamy in texture (and they are, in fact, a little drier and a touch grainy). For example, Empowered is described as usable for “all over” as a “wash of color” or “wet as an eyeliner.” Defiance is described as a “hard pressed tattoo pigment” that can be “used as an eyeliner” but for “all over color” one is to “blend carefully.” Debauched can be used “all over” but is listed as a “hard pressed sheer matte fuchsia pigment.”

I reached out to Viseart/Anastasia on the new formula, and from that conversation, these were my takeaways: they have a similar ingredient list but they are pressed significantly harder in order to be able take more water (as they are designed to be used wet or dry as liner) but that they are packed with extra pigment to balance.
",A-
GIORGIO ARMANI,MILANO (501),Lipstick,"a medium, rosy mauve with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had rich color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly in a single layer. The consistency was velvety, denser but smooth as I applied it to my lips, yet it managed to feel lightweight while worn. It had good adherence but did not settle into my lip lines, and it stayed on well for seven hours on me. The formula felt lightly hydrating while worn as well, which was a nice bonus!",A
GIORGIO ARMANI,NIGHTBERRY (201),Lipstick,"a medium-dark burgundy with subtle, warm red undertones and a satin finish. It had slightly more slip compared to the other shades I tried, though it was still not truly creamy or emollient on. This shade was richly pigmented and had a smooth, velvety texture that applied evenly and smoothly in a fluid stroke. The color lasted nicely for eight hours on me and was lightly moisturizing.",A+
LAURA MERCIER ,SHADOWS AND BRIGHTS,Palette,"four, travel-sized jumbo eyeshadow pencils in plummy taupe, copper, dirty gold, and soft, rosy copper. All four shades had good pigmentation, long-wear, and were blendable on my skin. In the swatches, I showed them in one, fluid stroke as well as sheered out (as more of a “wash” of color). I love Laura Mercier’s holiday Caviar Eye Stick sets as they’re a good value and are usually of high quality, so it’s a nice one to see come around each year.

The Caviar Sticks retail for $29.00 and contain 0.05 oz. or $580.00/oz., so the set has a total value of $69.60.",A
LAURA MERCIER ,HIDDEN GEMS,Palette,"a new, limited edition 12-pan palette for the holidays with an array of jewel-toned hues. There were only two mattes in the palette, which was a surprise as usually the brand’s pre-made palettes are more of a mix. The pigmentation was typically semi-opaque to opaque, while the eyeshadows had a slightly drier, dustier consistency across the board that. That texture made them better suited for someone who likes to use their eyeshadows with a dampened brush as that will help them apply more smoothly and have less fallout during application. I’m happy to see the brand playing with texture and color, but I wish the formula was better.",B-
GIORGIO ARMANI,DIVA (200),Lipstick,"a deep, reddish-brown with subtle, warm undertones and faint golden pearl strewn throughout. I’m not sure why this particular shade wasn’t called out as having shimmer, as the other three I tried were much more matte. It had a velvety, dense consistency that seemed thicker as I applied but felt lightweight and comfortable on my lips. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer and stayed on well for seven hours on me with a non-drying feel.",A
GIORGIO ARMANI,LUCKY RED (403),Lipstick,"a medium red with neutral-to-cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. The color payoff was opaque in a single layer, which adhered evenly and smoothly across my lips without emphasizing my lip lines. It had a velvety consistency that was denser and seemed thicker but felt rather lightweight, which made it comfortable to wear over the eight hours it lasted for. The formula felt lightly hydrating after the end of the day.",A+
ESTEE LAUDER,MIRAGE,Highlighter,"a medium copper with warm, rosy undertones and a metallic sheen. It had rich color payoff with a smooth, moderately dense consistency that didn’t have any excess powderiness in the pan but was still blendable and easy to work with on my skin. The finish was more metallic and emphasized my skin’s texture slightly. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before fading a bit. In the past, this formula hasn’t been scented, but this has the Bronze Goddess scent in it.",A
MAC,NYMA TANG,Lipstick,"a medium-dark red with a cool, blue undertone and a satin finish. It was richly pigmented with a lightly emollient consistency that was thin without being clingy, so it glided easily across my lips but adhered well for long-wear and did not feather or bleed on me over time. The lipstick stayed on well for over six hours, left a faint stain behind, and was lightly hydrating.
",A
TOO FACED,SUGAR PEACH,Palette,"contains a light beige, orange-coral, peachy-brown, and pop of pink with all of the shades containing shimmer. Three of the shades were high-shine to metallic and one shade was sparkly. The shades could be used with a wet brush or sponge to intensify the shine/shimmer in the respective shade, but the pigmentation, blendability, and luminosity were all easy to achieve with a dry brush so wet application wasn’t necessary–it made the palette very versatile as it was truly wet/dry.",A-
COLOUR POP,IN RETROGRADE,Palette,"includes five liquid eyeshadows with sparkling and/or metallic finishes and medium to opaque color coverage. They are also available individually in the event that only a couple catch your eye! I struggled with Party Posse, as it flaked on me within minutes of applying it, and I couldn’t find a way to apply it to prevent that, whereas the other four applied well and didn’t flake at all!",A-
COLOUR POP,CRUSH ON YOU,Palette,"takes the brand’s cream highlighters (that we normally see in screw-top pots) and puts them in a slim, cardboard palette. I don’t know the magic that was involved in this, but I’m certainly interested in learning more about it! So far, I haven’t noticed any changes in the texture (it’s been a week or so) or that “wet” feel of them in the pan, but I am curious how it will hold up over time. All four shades performed consistently with the Super Shock formula overall with one shade being a little less pigmented (or less buildable) and not quite as easy to work with as the other three.",A
NARS,HAMMAMET,Palette,"includes a medium, matte peach and a medium, copper-brown. Both shades had good pigmentation, lasted for seven to eight hours, and were fairly blendable and easy to work with, though the shimmery shade was the better performing between the two colors.",A-
NARS,SURABAYA,Palette,"includes two warm-toned neutrals: a matte, mid-tone brown and a satiny, orange-toned brown. Both shades performed well with good pigmentation, blendability, and eight-hour wear. They also paired well together if one was looking for a two-shade look.",A-
COLOUR POP,GOOD SPORT,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette for fall that features a mix of neutrals with pops of purple, yellow, and green. The colors came together cohesively, and there seemed to be a good mix of finishes and depths. Note: the press samples sent out of this palette have Trophies and Flow reversed; Trophies is intended to be a purple and Flow is intended to be a deep brown/taupe.",A-
COLOUR POP,LIKE A SNACK,Palette,"six shades ranging from peachy-coral to navy blue to deep burgundy. Five of the six shades were nice to wear and work with, but one shade fell quite short. They are available as a set, but they can also be purchased individually if preferred.",A-
DIOR,BAL (250),Blush,"a soft, medium pink with warm undertones and flecks of gold micro-glitter over a more matte finish. There were some of the glittery bits that translated onto my skin when I applied the blush on my cheeks, but they weren’t too noticeable and didn’t seem to migrate much over time. The blush had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation with a soft, slightly powedery texture that was a little messy in the pan but did not look dry or chalky applied to my skin. It applied evenly, blended out easily, and lasted for eight hours before fading noticeably on me.",B
NARS,FIRENZE,Eyeshadow," a sparkling, medium pink with strong, warm undertones. It had medium coverage applied with a dry brush, which had slight fallout when I applied it in patting/pressing motions to my lid. It had opaque color payoff when I used it with a dampened brush, and there was much less fallout during application. The eyeshadow had a soft, drier consistency that was more loosely-pressed in the pan, so there was some powderiness in the pan as a result. It stayed on well for eight hours both wet and dry but had some fallout over time with a dry application.",B-
NARS,CHILE,Eyeshadow,"a silvery gray base with pink-to-lavender shifting sparkle and micro-glitter. It had chunkier sparkle/glitter compared to other Hardwired shades, which made it harder to work with when using it dry. The consistency was drier and rougher due to the amount of sparkle, and there was a moderate amount of fallout if I applied it dry. When I used it with a dampened brush, the eyeshadow had semi-opaque, buildable coverage that adhered more smoothly to bare skin and had just a little bit of fallout to content with during application. It wore well for seven hours with some fallout dry and eight hours with very little fallout damp.",C-
NARS,CABO SAN LUCAS,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium pink with warmer undertones and a satin finish. The consistency was drier and dustier, which resulted in some powderiness on my actual lid (not always the case) and this caused the natural texture of my lid to be more apparent to my eye. It had good pigmentation, though, and blended out well along the edges. This shade lasted nicely for seven hours on me before fading noticeably.",B
NARS,ROME,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium taupe with subtle, warm undertones and a pearly sheen. The texture was firmer and drier to the touch, which resulted in medium color payoff that didn’t build up well without using it with a dampened brush. The eyeshadow did blend out easily and for someone who prefers wash of color, it might be just the right balance of coverage and consistency. It lasted for just over seven and a half hours on me before fading a bit.",C+
SEPHORA,NEW NUDES,Palette,"28 eyeshadows with mostly matte shades with a few shimmers (satin to metallic). I wish I enjoyed the formula used in the PRO palettes, but I find it particularly dry, which can result in powderiness, fallout, shades that sheer out as soon as one tries to blend them out, and poorer wear. They are somewhat better over eyeshadow primer, but I still found that it fell short of what I’d expect when there are many other eyeshadows that perform better.",B-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,L'ENFER,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark fuchsia with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly across my lips without tugging or dragging. The consistency was smooth, velvety, and glided on well but didn’t feel wet or truly cream-like either. The lipstick sat in my deeper lip lines just slightly, though it was barely noticeable in the close-up and not at all visible to my eye in person. It wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,LONDON SUEDE,Lipstick,"a dark beige with warm, rosy undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a smooth, thin consistency that applied evenly but had a tendency to emphasize the texture of my lips a bit. The finish wasn’t as smoothing or as flattering as other shades I have tried in the formula. It stayed on well for three and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing (even if it didn’t appear that way!).",B-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,STILETTO,Lipstick,"a medium-dark red with neutral-to-cool undertones and a satin finish. The color coverage was nearly opaque in a single layer, while the texture was lightly creamy, smooth, and comfortable to apply as it skated across my lips. The lipstick adhered well to my lips without gathering in my lip lines. This shade lasted for six hours, left a faint stain behind, and was hydrating over time.",A
SHISEIDO,TWILIGHT HOUR (02),Blush,"a medium pink with warmer undertones and a barley-there golden pearl. It had good pigmentation in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with less than half of a layer on top. The powder was velvety, silky, and smooth to the touch without being powdery (but it also wasn’t too dense or stiff in the pan). It was on the thinner side, though, and applied better over lightly powdered (or drier) skin than on my bare skin, particularly with respect to evenness and blendability. This shade wore well for eight hours before fading noticeably on me.",A-
NARS,EARTHSHINE,Eyeshadow,"medium pink with warm undertones and lots of copper and lighter pink sparkle. It had more of a shiny, metallic finish but plenty of sparkle that twinkled when the light reflected off of it. It had semi-sheer coverage applied dry, and the texture was more loosely pressed with a drier consistency that resulted in some fallout, even when I pressed and pushed the eyeshadow onto my skin. It was buildable in coverage, though, without having to use it damp. The eyeshadow did apply significantly better–nearly opaque, smoother, less fallout–when used with a dampened brush. It wore well for eight hours both wet and dry but had less fallout over time when I had applied it with a dampened brush.",B
NARS,MENDOZA,Eyeshadow,"a medium, coppery brown with warm, orange undertones and flecks of gold and pink sparkle. The texture was soft, loosely pressed, and a touch drier compared to the average eyeshadow. I found that it was usable dry when I pressed and patted it onto my lid, though there was slight fallout, and I could get medium, buildable coverage that way. If I used it with a dampened brush, it yielded opaque, smooth coverage with very little fallout (if any). It wore well for eight hours regardless of application method but had a bit of fallout over time when used dry.",B+
NARS,POINTE NOIRE,Eyeshadow,"a deep plum with subtle, warm undertones and a sparkling finish. It was richly pigmented both wet and dry with a soft, smooth consistency that was a smidgen dry to the touch but wasn’t actually powdery or dusty. It was easy to work with dry for opaque coverage that adhered evenly to bare skin, though the dampened application required even less product and gave it a smoother, shinier finish on my lid. This shade stayed on well for eight hours with a touch of fallout when it was applied dry but no fallout when it was used wet.",A-
NARS,NEW YORK,Eyeshadow,"a medium, plummy brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable color coverage with a smooth, velvety texture that felt finely-milled and was easy to blend out on my skin. It applied evenly and lasted well for eight hours on me.",A-
NATASHA DENONA,SAFARI,Palette,"a new, limited edition all-matte eyeshadow palette with a mix of neutrals and earthy pops of color (like blue and green). The performance of the eyeshadows was quite good, particularly for mattes and without requiring the use of primer to get even/opaque coverage. I found that most shades applied better in practice than they swatched (and part of that is likely due to my forearm being much drier than my eyelids). I can see this palette pairing well numerous shimmer-dominated palettes we’ve seen over the years, including the brand’s own 28-shade palettes.

Also: It would be great if brands spent a little more time ensuring that their product names were respectful to any themes or places that they are inspired by. A palette inspired by a safari could have easily stayed within a flora/fauna realm of names instead of extending into using the names of ethnic groups (Amhara and Maasai) that are used without context (just seems like exoticizing the theme).",A-
BITE BEAUTY,FOUR LITTLE BITES,Palette,"a new, limited edition set of travel-sized lipsticks that range from soft pink-coral to deep burgundy. Three of the four shades are from the permanent range, while Date is new to the Amuse Bouche range (and exclusive to the set). All four shades performed well and consistently with previous shades in the formula. I’m a big fan of Bite’s mini sets for the holidays as they’re still a good size but you’ll get four colors for about the price of one, full-sized shade.",A
SHISEIDO,SOLAR HAZE (05),Blush,"a light-medium, golden orange with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had excellent pigmentation in a single layer, which applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin. The consistency was dense, firm but not stiff, and smooth to the touch. Of the shades I tried in the range, this was one of the more shimmery ones, and I did find that it emphasized my skin’s texture somewhat when worn at semi-opaque or higher coverage. The less shimmery shades have been more smoothing/softening overall. The powder was easy to apply and blend out, though, and stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me.",A
NARS,ST-PAUL-DE-VENCE,Palette,"a shimmery, peach-orange complemented by a mid-tone, matte brown. Both shades were good, and the minor issues I had would easily be solved with a solid eyeshadow primer underneath. The two shades worked well as a duo, and they would also work well as a set of shades that could work in a variety of looks (using other products one has).",A-
NARS,SILK ROAD,Palette,"two shimmery shades: a warm, golden peach and a soft copper. The left side of the duo performed well, while the right side had a dustier texture and sheerer coverage, so it had room for improvement.
",B+
TOO FACED,MELTED CLOVER II,Lipstick,"a bright, light-medium pink-coral with warm unde3rtones and a flat, matte finish. It had opaque color payoff in a single layer, which spread evenly and smoothly across my lips for even application. The consistency was thinner but not watery, which made it easy to maneuver the color along the edges of my lips. It dried down within 30 seconds with a transfer-resistant finish that was a touch tacky (but didn’t lift up color) for a half hour or so. The product did pull away at some of my deeper lip lines when I smiled broadly and looked “cracked.” It worew well for six and a half hours and was slightly drying.",A-
SHISEIDO,INNER LIGHT (01),Highlighter,"a light, pinky-beige with warm undertones and a frosted finish. It had good pigmentation (though it might seem more medium-coverage based on how close it appears to my skin in my arm swatch) in a single layer with a very shiny, very frosted finish. This is more like a true highlighter for most skin tones but on very fair skin tones, it would add color as well. While the powder had a smooth, velvety texture that was almost cream-like, it did not sit as well on my skin as I anticipated; I found it rather accentuating of my natural texture. I thought it was just that day I swatched it, but it was the same on subsequent applications. The highlighter stayed on well for eight hours before fading a bit.",A-
NARS,MELROSE,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium pink with warm undertones and a sparkling finish. It had a a slightly drier, more loosely-pressed consistency, which made it difficult to work with dry without getting a moderate amount of fallout and sheerer coverage. If I used it with a dampened brush, the pigmentation was opaque in a single laye,r and the majority of the product adhered to my lid. It lasted for five hours with fallout when used dry but lingered for closer to eight hours with slight fallout when applied with a dampened brush.",C-
NARS,ISHTA,Eyeshadow,"a deep, reddish-berry with subtle, cool undertones and a mostly matte finish. I could see very, very fine pearl strewn throughout, but the finish itself looked matte when applied and at a glance. It had opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin. The texture was soft, velvety, and not too powdery but not too firm in the pan, so it remained blendable and easy to work with. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.",A-
NARS,SULTAN,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium purple with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation with a soft, slightly powdery consistency. The eyeshadow was blendable and layered well, though there was some fallout from the powderiness when I built up the coverage. It stayed on well for seven and a half hours on me before fading noticeably.
",B
NARS,STRADA,Eyeshadow,"a medium lavender with subtle, cool undertones and flecks of greenish-gold sparkle over a matte finish. I was surprised by how much the color darkened when I used it, as I expected it to be more true-to-pan but instead it darkened 3-4 shades when it was applied to my skin. This happened even when I tried it over an eyeshadow primer. The texture was soft, somewhat powdery, and had some fallout (from the sparkle), though Isome of the shimmer and sparkle stayed on my skin. It had good pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The color lasted well for eight hours with slight fallout over time.",B-
MAC,DAVIDBLOND,Lipstick,"a medium pink with soft, warm undertones and a lightly pearlized finish. It had medium color coverage, which was somewhat buildable to semi-opaque coverage if desired, though it was a Lustre finish, so the sheerness was expected. The texture was lightweight, thin, and moderately emollient–it felt creamier than most Lustres, actually. The color applied fairly evenly but slid around a bit while worn. It wore well for three hours and was lightly hydrating to me.",B+
MAC,PHILLIPEBLOND,Lipstick,"a medium-dark red with cool, blue undertones and a semi-matte finish. It was richly pigmented and had a smooth, lightly creamy texture that glided across my lips without dragging. The color went on evenly and stayed out of my lip lines, and it did not bleed or feather on me over time. It wore well for over six hours, left a faint stain behind, and was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",A
DIOR,ROSE BAISER (361),Blush,"a medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a pearly sheen. The consistency was soft, a smidgen powdery in the pan, but it was easy to apply and blend out for even, diffused color on my cheeks. It had excellent pigmentation that was easy to work with whether I wanted sheerer coverage (using a lighter hand) or intense coverage (using a moderate hand). The blush blended out well along the edges and yielded a natural sheen–skin-like but not actually shimmery–that stayed on nicely for eight and a half hours on me.
",A
NARS,BABY JANE,Eyeshadow,"a bright, sky blue with a matte finish. It had medium coverage that was buildable to semi-opaque color payoff, but it was more powdery in the pan and seemed to darken noticeably on my skin as it absorbed the natural oils on my skin (almost bluish-teal), even when I tried layering it over a primer. It lasted for seven hours on me before fading noticeably.",C
NARS,TROPIC,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark green-leaning teal with subtle, cool undertones and flecks of glitter over a matte finish. The texture was drier and firmer with a stiff texture that was more difficult to pick up, apply, and blend out. I was able to pack it on and build up to opaque coverage with three to four layers, but there was a moderate amount of fallout from the glitter. It started to fade noticeably on me after seven hours of wear.
",F
NARS,OUTREMER,Eyeshadow,"a bright, cobalt blue with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation that was buildable to opaque coverage with a second layer. There was darkening within a few minutes of application on my skin, but itt was still noticeably blue–just more of a brighter, navy blue. In order to retain the brightness, it needed a white base underneath it. The consistency was soft, slightly powdery in the pan, but it blended out easily. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.",B+
NARS,SHOWGIRL,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium blue with cool undertones and a frosted sheen. The pigmentation was fantastic with rich, opaque coverage in a single layer. The texture was denser, almost cream-like, and had a thicker consistency compared to most of the shades in the range. It applied well to bare skin but took a little more effort to diffuse and blend along the edges due to the thickness (but it adhered extremely well, so as a lid shade, it’s great). It lasted for eight and a half hours on me.",A-
NARS,ZAMBEZI,Eyeshadow,"a pale, mint green with subtle, warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a soft, smooth consistency that was a smidgen dusty in the pan, but it seemed more from being more loosely pressed and didn’t have fallout when I worked with it on my lid. This shade stayed on well for eight hours on me before creasing faintly.",A-
COLOUR POP,SLAY DAY,Palette,"a sheer, peachy gloss and two liquid lipsticks, one in pink-based purple and the other in a blue-based red. Each shade can also be purchased individually if preferred. The gloss was comfortable and easy to wear, and it should work well for anyone in the market for sheer and sparkly. The two lliquid lipsticks were pigmented and long-wearing, though the Season 10 performed better overall.",A-
FENTY BEAUTY,HOW MANY CARATS,Highlighter,"pale silver shimmer and larger sparkle. It’s exactly as described by the brand–“a glittering veil”–that adds moderate sparkle wherever one applies it. The base was translucent, so it layered well with various blushes while adding very shiny, glittery goodness. It had a smooth, slightly spongy texture–like a cream-powder hybrid that was a little more cream-like than powder-like by touch–that adhered evenly and blended out for an even layer of sparkle/glitter.

I did find that it could emphasize my skin’s natural texture slightly when I applied more than a sheer to semi-sheer layer of it, though it caught light beautifully in person that I barely noticed the emphasis from a normal distance. This glitter-happy highlighter adhered well to bare skin and didn’t dust away immediately; there was slight migration over time but most of it stuck around (ha, ha) for a solid eight hours.
",A-
SHISEIDO,NIGHT ROSE (203),Lipstick,"a muted, dusty coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque in a single layer, which spread evenly across my lips. It had a lightweight consistency that was not quite as slippery as other shades in the range, and I felt like it sank into my deeper lip lines a tad, though it wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The lipstick was creamy and easy to apply, so the wear was comfortable over the five hours it stayed on well for.",A-
SHISEIDO,STREAMING MAUVE (208),Lipstick,"a medium-dark, rosy mauve with warmer undertones and a cream finish. The lipstick had opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which applied evenly and fluidly directly from the tube. It felt lightly creamy with some slip and almost felt “wet” initially, but it set lightly to a lightly tacky texture that was still comfortable to wear but kept the lipstick from sliding around too easily. It stayed on well for five and a half hours and was moisturizing over time.",A
SHISEIDO,ROSE MUSE (211),Lipstick,"a soft, medium pink with strong, warm undertones and a satin sheen. It had good color coverage in one stroke, though just shy of full coverage. The lipstick was lightly creamy, smooth, and comfortable to apply and to wear as it had just enough slip to feel nourishing but not slide around over time. There was a touch of tackiness that became present about 45 minutes after I applied it (but it didn’t lift color if I pressed my lips together). This shade lasted nicely for four and a half hours and was hydrating over time.",B+
DIOR,DOLCE VITA (555),Blush,"a deep, reddened plum with soft, warm undertones and a satin sheen. It had nearly opaque color coverage in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with less than half of a layer on top. I was able to apply less product using a lighter hand and build up that way as well. I would recommend using a moderately dense blush brush with this, as the powder had a smoother, denser, and slightly creamy consistency to it that didn’t play as well with more feathery/ultra soft brushes. It applied fairly evenly to my cheeks and blended out nicely, while the satin sheen sat well on my skin–natural but not overtly shimmery. The blush started to fade noticeably after nine hours of wear.",A-
MAC,THEBLONDS,Highlighter,"a light-medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a luminous sheen. The powder had a very smooth, almost velvety consistency, as it was firmer, denser, but not heavy or thick, so I didn’t have any issues picking up the product with softer brushes but there wasn’t any powderiness in the pan either. It had opaque color coverage that applied evenly to bare skin, blended out with ease, and didn’t emphasize my skin’s natural texture. It wore well for eight hours on me before I noticed slight fading. Also, the compact is enormous–0.63 oz.!–which is over double the average highlighter.",A
COLOUR POP,STUDY BUDDY,Palette,"a new, limited edition set of six cream eyeshadows ranging from a shiny, champagne gold to a deep plum. All six shades were shimmery or sparkly, so they’ll pair best with other satin and matte eyeshadows found in one’s stash than worn altogether (which can be a bit trickier!). The eyeshadows had mostly opaque to opaque color coverage, were blendable, and lasted well for 10 hours or longer. There were a couple of shades with more glitter content that had slight fallout over time but not enough to be concerning.",A-
FENTY BEAUTY,DIAMOND MILK,Lipgloss,"a translucent, slightly milky base with fine silver and white pearl. There was a smidgen of color to the base that lightened my natural lip color, but it was translucent to the point where it didn’t appear milky or white-based applied–which is good since it didn’t gather in my lip lines either! The texture was smooth, lightweight, and lightly creamy with a non-sticky consistency that wa spreadable and comfortable to wear. I found it very comparable in feel and wear to the original shade, though this shade applied better and was more smoothing. It wore well for three hours and was hydrating over time.",A
MAC,BIJOUXBLOND,Lipgloss,"a translucent base with flecks of pink and gold pearl and larger sparkles. MAC did describe it as “clear,” so it had exactly the pigmentation level expected (none!) with a semi-sheer amount of sparkle/pearl. The consistency was smooth, moderately tacky, a little thicker but not heavy on my lips, and comfortable to wear. The gloss smoothed out my lip lines, and the sparkles distributed evenly across my lips for even “coverage.” It lasted well for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A
SHISEIDO,BERRY DAWN (08),Blush,"a deep plum with modeate, warm undertones and a pearly sheen. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, while the texture was smooth, velvety, and finely-milled without being too dense or too softly pressed in the pan. There wasn’t any excess product that kicked up in the pan when I swirled my brush in it, but it was still readily picked up by my brush, deposited evenly to bare skin, and diffused easily along the edges for a smooth, even laydown of color. It had a noticeable sheen, but it did not emphasize my skin’s natural texture and wasn’t a true frost or metallic on but a little more shimmery than a true satin. It wore well for nine hours on me before I noticed slight fading.",A
URBAN DECAY,ELEMENTS,Palette,"a new, limited edition offering for the holidays that features 19 shades with four shades being mostly matte and the rest being very shimmery. There is an assortment of color with a mixture of cool- and warm-toned shades. I think that the person who this is best suited for is someone who doesn’t need a lot of mattes in their eyeshadow palette, whether they prefer shimmers in the crease or if they expect to pair this palette with mattes they already own.

I felt that this palette could have been more cohesive while still being a more colorful scheme by making Earth Bound a matte, deeper green (instead of a pearl/satin); Dream Weaver more of a dark, matte purplish-taupe (the pink doesn’t coordinate well with most of the palette to my eye!); and swapping Moon Rock for a deep plum or purple matte, as I felt that Moon Rock and Tectonic were similar enough that having both was redundant (or at least, given my need for more contrast and depth!).",B+
NARS,KUALA LUMPUR,Palette,"a shimmery peach and a mid-tone, satiny plum. This particular duo could have been quite cohesive for a two-shade look, but the quality was lacking in both shades–just too dry and dusty to perform well on its own. It was somewhat better over eyeshadow primer but still not impressive even then.",C
NARS,PORTOBELLO,Palette,"a very light, yellowish brown and a light, warmer brown, both with matte finishes. This is what I can see as a workhorse duo; one that, for the right skin tone, is an easy go-to pairing for transition choices or to give a lightly contoured effect on the eyes.",A
SHISEIDO,CODE RED (221),Lipstick,"a bright, medium red with neutral-to-cool undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single stroke, which covered my lips with even, smooth coverage. The texture was creamy and lightweight, which enabled the lipstick to skate across my lips with ease. The formula is extremely comfortable to wear but does eventually wear down to a more satin finish that has light tackiness (but doesn’t lift the color or create patchiness) that I imagine helps this shade last well for nearly eight hours while still being very hydrating.",A
SHISEIDO,GINZA RED (222),Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium orange-red with warm undertones and a creamy finish. The pigmentation was fantastic, while the color applied evenly and smoothly on my lips without dragging. The lipstick had a lightweight, moderately creamy consistency that felt wet going on but had a subtle, setting process where it developed a light tackiness and felt like it adhered better in place but wasn’t clingy. It lasted nicely for six and a half hours, and it kept my lips moisturizing over time.",A+
SHISEIDO,SHIZUKA RED (223),Lipstick,"a medium-dark copper with warm, rusty red undertones and a cream finish. It had rich color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly in a single layer. The consistency was lightly creamy, velvety, and comfortable to apply and to wear. I found that this shade was denser and a bit “heavier” in a way it looked (not felt) compared to other shades. This shade wore beautifully for seven hours on me and was nicely hydrating over time.",A+
DIOR,CHARNELLE (459),Blush,"a muted, medium-dark brown with warm, rosy undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which was easy to diffuse and blend out for more medium coverage on my skin or to use a lighter hand with and achieve more buildable coverage. The consistency was smooth to the touch, dense but not too stiff or firmly-pressed in the pan, and blendable. The blush applied evenly to bare skin and did not turn patchy when buffed on my cheeks. The satin finish gave it a soft glow that wasn’t overtly shimmery. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before starting to fade a bit.",A
STILA,IRIDESCENT,Palette,"a nice way to get three different layering, glitter eyeshadows in your stash in a size that’s more practical to use up, since they are liquid and are harder to keep as long past the expiration date (compared to powders). These three in particular seemed more suitable for layering over other eyeshadows or eyeliner or used as a wash of sparkle on the lid or inner tearduct to brighten. Stila often uses the descriptor “sheer” for the shades that are less coverage, but I didn’t see that used for any of these shades, unfortunately.",B
NARS,DOURO,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium yellow with a mostly matte finish. It had rich color coverage with a soft, slightly powdery texture that applied fairly evenly to bare skin, but it seemed to be more reactive to the natural oils on my skin as it darkened slightly. It was better over an eyeshadow primer, which helped it adhere better and kept it closer to the pan color. It was blendable and did not have fallout. The color lasted well for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
NARS,PERSIA,Eyeshadow,"a deep orange with warm, red undertones and a matte finish. It was intensely pigmented with a smooth, velvety texture that wasn’t powdery but was denser and more substantial–the texture was unlike every other matte shade in the range. In the previous formulation, it was one of the brand’s best eyeshadows, and it remains such in the updated formula–if all the mattes were like this, these would fly off the shelves. The eyeshadow applied well to bare skin, blended out easily, and wore well for eight and a half hours.",A
NARS,FATALE,Eyeshadow,"a bright, pinky-red with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, while the eyeshadow felt soft, velvety, and smooth without being dusty or powdery. It applied evenly to my lid and blended out without difficulty. This shade stayed on nicely for eight and a half hours on me.
",A
NARS,DOMINATION,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark pink with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation paired with a slightly thinner, drier texture. The eyeshadow remained blendable, though, so it wasn’t a challenge to work with it even if it needed to be layered for true, opaque coverage. It lasted for just over seven and a half hours on me.
",B
NARS,NIGHT STAR,Eyeshadow,"a light beige with warm, yellow undertones and flecks of chunky sparkle strewn throughout. The sparkles were a waste of time–I saw them in the pan, but as soon as I applied and blended the edges of the eyeshadow, they disappeared or dropped below my lid. The consistency was soft, slightly powdery, but blendable and fairly easy to use and yielded mostly opaque coverage (though it sheered out a bit). It wore well for seven and a half hours on me before fading a bit.
",B
NARS,LUNAR,Eyeshadow,"a medium lavender with warm, pinky undertones and flecks of multi-colored sparkle. Applied dry, it had semi-sheer coverage and some fallout when applied to bare skin and blended out. Applied with a dampened brush, it had semi-opaque coverage that didn’t have fallout and applied more evenly. The eyeshadow stayed on well for seven hours dry and eight hours dampened but had some fallout over time.",C+
COLOUR POP,KNEW IDEA,Palette,"six shades across cream, satin, and matte finishes. Four shades were very good and consistent with their respective finishes, while one (I Like It) was a little slippery and one was denser/dragging (Fast as You).",A
SHISEIDO,ALPEN GLOW (06),Blush,"a medium coral with strong, orange undertones and a satin finish. It was intensely pigmented with a soft, silky consistency that was denser and more substantial than the other shades I tried within the formula. The blush applied well to bare skin with even application and was a cinch to diffuse and soften the edges for a seamless blend. It sat well on my skin and had a natural finish that looked subtly glowing on my cheek bone but more semi-matte on the apples of my cheek (it really did look like a highlighting blush!). This shade stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me before fading, though the brand only marketed it as eight-hour wear (I love a reasonable wear-time claim!).",A
NATASHA DENONA,SUNSET (2018),Palette,"the formula has been changed. Just a glance through the ingredient lists between shades from the original release and the permanent, going-forward release shows significant differences (both in exclusions and inclusions as well as order). I compared the two palettes by applying shades from each respective release on an eye, so that I could understand any differences in application as well as color. Overall, the application wasn’t very different between the two palettes, but I did find some key color differences that change how the color scheme comes together due to the changes in a few shades (Panjin, Horizon, Terra, Mandarine).

The current version of the palette, particularly the mattes, seem to be richer, slightly deeper or even more pigmented, while the shimmers seemed to be slightly finer and not as thick/cream-like in texture but looked similar applied. The other aspect that was improved was the wear–I do find that Natasha Denona’s current shimmer formula holds up better on my lids than the more oily/creamier version of the brand’s shimmers–and I did notice that the mattes seemed to stay true-to-color a little longer as well. The previous matte formula may seem more user-friendly and a little easier to work with, especially deeper hues, as the updated formula’s pigmentation seemed to stretch further.",A
NARS,PANDORA,Palette,"a soft, shimmery white and a deep, matte black. The white eyeshadow was somewhat disappointed, though the matte black was quite good. I like the concept, though I’m curious whether more people would prefer a matte white instead of a satiny one.",B
NARS,KALAHARI,Palette,"a warm, golden taupe and a soft, rosy brown. The two shades can work well together, but the quality of both made the duo a miss for me–too dusty, which led to sheerer coverage, a drier look on my lids, and sub-par longevity.
",B-
SHISEIDO,HIGH RISE (225),Lipstick,"a brighter, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a cream finish. The color payoff was good, just shy of truly opaque coverage in a single stroke, that applied the lipstick evenly and smoothly. The texture was moderately creamy with a “wet” feel initially, but it developed slight tackiness within an hour of wear that ensured the color adhered well without sliding around (but without feeling clingy). I was impressed by how smooth the product looked on my lips. It stayed on well for five hours and was hydrating over time.",A-
SHISEIDO,FUTURE SHOCK (215),Lipstick,"a muted, medium purple with strong, warm undertones and a cream finish. The color coverage was good, though not quite opaque in a single layer, but the color applied evenly and didn’t gravitate toward my lip lines. The lipstick was smooth, lightweight, and creamy with enough slip to glide across my lips well but didn’t feather or slide around while worn. This was likely due to the formula developing some tackiness within an hour of application that kept the color on longer and better, though it was still comfortable to wear. It wore well for six and a half hours and was moisturizing to wear.",A
SHISEIDO,VORTEX (216),Lipstick,"a deep, plummy burgundy with subtle, warm undertones and a glossy sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly, but it could have been both more pigmented and less slippery. I was surprised that the color didn’t sink into every lip line, though, so that was impressive. The consistency became tackier within 45 minutes of application, which kept it from feathering or bleeding, but this shade was too slippery and more challenging to apply directly from the tube as a result. The color stayed on nicely for five and a half hours on me and was hydrating over time.",B+
NARS,VERONA,Eyeshadow,"a dusty lavender with subtle, warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It was deceptively shimmery–it seemed almost dusty in texture and then appeared rather brightening when applied to my skin. It had rich pigmentation with a soft, blendable texture that adhered well to bare skin despite being a little drier by touch. It lasted for just over eight hours on me before fading noticeably.",A-
NARS,STUD,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, golden taupe with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. Sometimes, I want to describe it as a deep, warm pewter. It had semi-opaque pigmentation when applied with a dry brush, and it was buildable, blendable, and only had slight fallout that stayed on well for seven hours (with slight fallout). When I tried using it with a dampened brush, it was richly pigmented and had a smoother, more blendable consistency that adhered well to bare skin for eight and a half hour wear. The new formula is slightly drier than the previous one, which was easier to use dry but the quality and application were similar when using the new formula with a wet brush.",B+
NARS,ARGENTINA,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark purple with subtle, warm undertones and cooler overtones that gave it a slightly “cooler” appearance overall. It was paired with a sparkling, lightly metallic finish. Applied dry, it had semi-sheer coverage, moderate fallout, and really had to pressed and pushed onto my lid in order to get a mostly even application. Applied with a dampened brush, it had opaque pigmentation with a smoother consistency that was easier to work with and to blend out on my skin. It wore well for six hours dry (with moderate fallout) and eight hours damp (with slight fallout).",B-
NARS,COCONUT GROVE,Eyeshadow,"a deep, taupe-brown with neutral undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable color payoff with a soft, silky texture that wasn’t too powdery nor too firmly pressed in the pan. I found it easier to work with than the previous formulation, as the eyeshadow applied more evenly and blended out with less effort. It stayed on nicely for seven and a half hours o me before starting to fade noticeably on my lid.",B+
NARS,BIARRITZ,Eyeshadow,"a bright beige with soft, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had excellent pigmentation that adhered fairly well to bare skin, though it sheered out a bit. The consistency was denser and more substantial than a lot of the matte eyeshadows I’ve tried by NARS, which gave it better opacity on bare skin, but it did have some powderiness and fallout that could drop down and cause deeper matte shades to look lighter (almost ashy). It wore well for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
PAT MCGRATH,BRONZE SEDUCTION,Palette,"a new, permanent palette that contains an assortment of warmer-toned hues ranging from peachy-gold to deep eggplant. I think the palette lives up to the marketing, but I’d recommend anyone new to the brand’s formulas to consider the brand’s application instructions, which they give for each shade, as often the shades are designed to be used wet/dry or with fingertips. The palette felt like a holiday party, even though it’s a fall launch, with the rich red, greenish duochrome, and intense sparkle in several shades. The finishes are definitely more impressive in person as they sparkle and dance with the light.",A
DIOR,ULTRA STAR (777),Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange with warm, red undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque in a single layer, which applied evenly and smoothly overall, though that was slight product in my deeper lip lines. It wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance, though. It had a lightweight, slightly thinner consistency compared to the other shades (and it is already a thinner formula), so it wasn’t as smoothing of my lip texture as it could have been. It was comfortable to wear for the five and a half hours it lasted for, and the formula felt moisturizing to my lips.",C+
DIOR,ULTRA DIOR (999),Lipstick,"a medium, orange-red with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had good color payoff in a single layer and required a second layer for full coverage. It had a creamy, emollient texture that felt a bit more balm-like than like a typical lipstick, as it was thin without being clingy or sheer. The texture felt a touch clingier after a minute of “setting” on my lips, but it still retained the shine of its natural finish. The lipstick stayed on well for five hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.
",B-
DIOR,ULTRA ATOMIC (660),Lipstick,"a bright, medium fuchsia pink with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly, but it was thinner and had moderate slip, which resulted in a formula that clung to my lips more noticeably and emphasized my lip lines. The lipstick glided across my lips and felt smooth going on, but I was surprised that highlighted my lip texture as most of the range did not. It lasted for four and a half hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",C
TOO FACED,APRICOT IN THE ACT,Palette,"a warm, gold highlighter and a darker, coral blush. The two shades layered well together to create a gold-shimmered coral hue on my cheeks. They were easy to use alone and had buildable coverage, as marketed, that stayed on well for eight hours.",A-
LAURA MERCIER ,TRANSLUCENT MEDIUM DEEP,Highlighter,"a soft, medium-tan with warm undertones and a medium, golden sheen. It had sheer to semi-sheer coverage when applied with a powder brush and dusted all-over my face (which isn’t shown, as this shade isn’t intended for my skin tone but those deeper than I, please refer to my Translucent review for an idea of the effect of the powder all-over). It was buildable, like the lighter shade, so I applied it more heavily to show how it looks on my skin and to make it clear that this isn’t a subtly, luminous powder either.

The powder felt smooth, silky, and was very finely-milled, which made it easy to apply all-over to set my base makeup but could also be built-up to act more as a light to moderate highlighter. It sat well on my skin, but it wasn’t as blurring/smoothing compared to the original powder, which is more mattifying. The slight sheen it gave all-over was visible to my eye, which may or may not be your cup of tea. If you’re someone who tends to like a dewy, very glowy base, then it might be a good fit. I found this powder worked better to complement the more mattifying original powder. It extended the wear of my base products by two to four hours, depending on the formula, environmental conditions, and how heavy (or sheer) the application of. I would say it typically made my base wear well for between 10 and 14 hours.",A
DIOR,ULTRA TROUBLE (436),Lipstick,"a medium copper with strong, warm orange undertones and a cream finish. The pigmentation was fantastic with rich, color coverage delivered in a single, fluid stroke. It had a lightly creamy consistency that felt more like a lightweight balm going on my lips as there was no tugging or dragging, but there was still richness in hue. It felt a touch “clingy” after a minute of wear, as the formula’s texture seemed to shift ever-so-slightly as it “set” in place. While that had initially given me home that it’d make it to 12-hour wear (as promised), it only lasted for five and a half hours, though it was nicely hydrating.",B+
DIOR,ULTRA SPICE (641),Lipstick,"a medium-dark, coppery-red with warm undertones and a satin finish. The color payoff was very nearly opaque in a single layer, while the lipstick had a smooth, creamy consistency that didn’t feel overly slippery or emollient, so it adhered evenly and stayed put. The texture was lightweight and comfortable as the lipstick never dragged or tugged on my lips when applied directly from the tube. It wore well for five and a half hours and kept my lips hydrated while worn.",B+
DIOR,ULTRA FIRE (651),Lipstick,"a deep, coral-red with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied somewhat evenly but had a tendency to get into my lip lines and emphasized my natural lip texture. The texture was thin, balmy, and glided easily across my lips without tugging. It lasted for five hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.",C+
DIOR,ULTRA SHOCK (851),Lipstick,"a medium-dark red with neutral-to-cool undertones paired with a lightly glossy, cream finish. It yielded opaque pigmentation in one, fluid stroke, and the color applied evenly and didn’t get into my lip lines. The texture was lightweight, lightly creamy, and smooth with a more balm-like feel, as it didn’t have the thickness/plushness of creamier lipstick formulas (yet still had the glide). The lipstick stayed on well for six hours, left a barely-there stain behind, and was lightly hydrating over time.",B+
DIOR,ULTRA POISON (883),Lipstick,"a deep burgundy with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. The lipstick had semi-opaque color coverage in a single layer, and it was somewhat buildable but not to the point of full coverage. It had a smooth, balmy consistency that had moderate slip and glided across my lips without tugging. There was a smidgen of product that sat in my deeper lip lines, though it wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance. This shade lasted nicely for five and a half hours and was moisturizing while worn.",B-
DIOR,ULTRA RADICAL (986),Lipstick,"a deep, brownish-burgundy with warm undertones and a cream finish. The color coverage was nearly opaque, though I noticed it did not adhere as well to the inner portion of my lower lip. The lipstick had a smooth, balm-like texture with moderate slip and did feel a bit more slippery compared to most shades in the line-up. I noticed the lipstick “set” just a touch so that the product felt clingier and not quite as slippery within a minute of the initial application (not in an uncomfortable way, though). This shade wore well for six hours and was lightly hydrating while worn.",B
NARS,MADRID,Eyeshadow,"a dirty, taupe-brown with warm gold and lavender sparkle. It had medium coverage when applied dry and opaque coverage when applied with a dampened brush. The dampened brush also yielded a better consistency, as it was smoother, adhered more evenly, and resulted in less fallout, though this shade was somewhat usable–at least over an eyeshadow primer–dry for a subtle, sparkling effect. It lasted for six hours dry (with some fallout) and eight hours wet (with minor fallout).",B-
NARS,CHINA BLUE,Eyeshadow,"a deep, navy blue with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation with a soft, silky consistency that wasn’t too thin or too dense in the pan. There was slight powderiness in the pan, but it did not translate on the lid–no dryness and no fallout. It blended out fairly easily–not as nicely as the best of warm neutrals but for this type of shade, it was a welcome respite from troublesome deep, matte hues! It darkened slightly on my lid, though, so it appeared a bit more like a blackened blue. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading a touch.",B+
NARS,GOLDFINGER,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium gold with strong, yellow undertones and a frosted finish. It had opaque pigmentation in a single layer that adhered fairly evenly to bare skin, though the texture was somewhat powdery and had a touch of fallout during application. The eyeshadow stayed on well for eight hours before starting to crease on me.",A-
NARS,GOA,Eyeshadow,"a medium, olive-leaning green with strong, warm brownundertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. Applied dry, it had semi-opaque pigmentation with a warmer, browner appearance and slight fallout during application, but it applied better dry than a lot of the other Hardwired shades. Applied wet, it had opaque coverage where the green sparkle and shimmer came through more noticeably; it adhered smoothly to bare skin and stayed on well for eight hours with slight fallout over time.",B
NARS,HELLCAT,Eyeshadow,"a medium, army green with warm, olive undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. It had a more muted, dirtier appearance when applied dry, where it was also more frosted (less metallic). The texture was soft, more loosely pressed with some excess product that kicked up in the pan when used with a dry brush. Applied wet, the eyeshadow went on with opaque coverage that adhered well to bare skin for a smooth, even finish that lasted well for eight hours with slight fallout over time.",B
NARS,NIGHT CLUBBING,Eyeshadow,"a deep black with subtle, warm brown undertones and a faint, golden sheen. It had nearly opaque color payoff that applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin. The texture was soft, a smidgen powdery in the pan, but the eyeshadow went on evenly and blended out with ease. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before it started to fade noticeably.
",A
NARS,BLONDIE,Eyeshadow,"a soft, yellowed taupe with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had opaque pigmentation with a soft, smooth consistency that was a smidgen dusty in the pan but applied evenly and blended out well on bare skin. It lasted for eight hours on me before it started to fade noticeably.",A-
LAURA MERCIER ,TRANSLUCENT,Highlighter,"a pale, yellowed powder with a golden sheen. It had sheer coverage when dusted all over my face (as a setting powder), but it had enough shimmer and was buildable that I was able to apply it as a highlighter on my cheekbones, just to give you a better idea of how much of a sheen this can add to the skin.

The powder was finely-milled and silky to the touch, which helped it apply all-over my face to set my base. Depending on the formula, how much of that formula I applied, and what I did that day, the wear ranged between 10 and 14 hours of solid wear out of my base (as compared to 7 to 12 hours without). I did not find that it was as good as smoothing on my skin’s natural texture and pores as the original Loose Setting Powder (which I love), but it did sit well on my skin and did not make my foundations appear cakey.

It yielded a noticeable sheen wherever I applied it; not really a subtle glow but light to moderate with faintly visible pearl if I looked closely, which I know can be a deal-breaker for some. I preferred using the Glow powder on the high points of my face and underneath my eyes but preferred the original for the rest of my face.",A
WET 'N' WILD,FIT FOR A QUEEN,Palette,"the easiest of the new, limited edition quads from the Fire & Ice collection. The weakest shade–#2–was still workable, and if used as an inner tearduct highlight or brow bone highlight, the sheerness didn’t seem like a deal-breaker. I wish all of the brand’s mattes performed as well as #3, though.
",B
DIOR,ULTRA DARING (755),Lipstick,"a medium-dark fuchsia with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was good, though shy of truly full-coverage color, and adhered evenly across my lips without sinking into my lip lines. The texture was lightweight, slightly thinner and less emollient compared to other shades (definitely less glossiness in the final look), though it was still comfortable to apply and to wear. It stayed on well for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",B-
DIOR,ULTRA PULSE (870),Lipstick,"a muted, deep berry with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had opaque color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly in a fluid stroke. The lipstick had a lightweight, lightly creamy, balm-like texture that skated across my lips with ease and laid down even color that didn’t settle into my lip lines. I felt the texture shift slightly within a minute of application and felt it cling just a touch (compared to the initial application). It wore well for five and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing over time.",B+
DIOR,ULTRA CRAVE (843),Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark red-plum with warm undertones and a cream finish. The pigmentation was fantastic with rich, opaque color that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips. It had a lightweight, lightly creamy consistency that was comfortable to apply and to wear as it never dragged and did not feel overly emollient that it became slippery during wear. This shade lasted beautifully on me for five and a half hours, which is surely solid wear, but a far cry from the 12-hours it was marketed as. The formula felt hydrating while I wore it.
",B+
TOO FACED,CHERRY BOMB,Palette,"a sparkling, copper highlighter and a warm red blush. The two shades coordinated well with each other, and I loved that the depth of both shades make it workable on a lot of skin tones. I wish the highlighter was softer and more blendable, as the blush was fantastic.
",B
NARS,CHARADE,Palette,"a warm mauve and a subtle, warm-toned lavender. It could have been a real workhorse of a duo for the right person’s preferences, but the quality was a miss–they both were drier, dustier eyeshadows that did not sit as well on skin and did not vastly improve over primer.",C
WET 'N' WILD,MYTHICOOL CREATURES,Palette,"a disappointing number from the brand when I know they can do better. The matte brown was decent, but the other three shades went from so-so to total failure. I stopped reviewing Wet ‘n’ Wild for awhile due to major inconsistencies in their eyeshadows–it just got to the point where there were so few winners that it didn’t make tracking them down worth the effort (thankfully, they are more accessible online now, so that saves some effort!).",F
NARS,KAUAI,Palette,"a “cool” gold with a metallic finish and a shimmery, medium-dark purple with subtle cool undertones. Both shades seemed consistent in quality with the previous formula, just slightly softer, a smidgen drier in comparison, but in terms of application and how they performed/looked on my eye, they seemed the same; however, Kauai II wasn’t quite as metallic.
",A
DIOR,ULTRA LOVE (770),Lipstick,"a deep, coral-red with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque in a single layer, while the texture was smooth, lightly creamy, and balm-like, as it skated across my lips with ease. It applied evenly, though it didn’t seem to smooth out my natural lip texture as much as other shades in the same formula have done. It stayed on nicely for six hours, left a faint stain behind, and was moisturizing.",B
DIOR,ULTRA LOUD (679),Lipstick,"a bright, fuchsia pink with strong, cool blue undertones and a cream finish. It seemed extremely pigmented when swatched, but there was more slip to the texture, which resulted in more semi-opaque, slightly uneven coverage. I was surprised as fuchsia hues seem fairly easy to do by most brands, so the room for improvement on this shade was unexpected. The consistency was balm-like and smooth, but it was slippery even after that initial “setting” period of the formula and was harder to keep in place, though I didn’t experience feathering personally. It lasted for five and a half hours on me but was hydrating while worn.
",C+
LAURA MERCIER ,INSPIRATION,Highlighter,"a medium, rosy copper with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It had medium, buildable pigmentation with a smooth, moderately dense consistency that was firm but not stiff to work with (it felt like a baked powder–a smidgen dry but not in a bad way) and blended out easily. The intensity and coverage were very much in line with the brand’s description, and as I layered the product on my skin, it became more shimmery and metallic, too. It semi-sheer to medium coverage, it had a soft glow that didn’t emphasize my skin’s natural texture. It wore well for eight hours before fading slightly on me.

100% of the proceeds of this shade are donated to the Laura Mercier Ovarian Cancer Fund.",A-
TOO FACED,PLUMAGRANATE,Palette,"a bright, fuchsia pink highlighter and a deeper pink blush. While the highlighter had room for improvement, the blush was easy to use and beautiful applied. The two shades coordinated well together for a richer highlighter/blush combination, which should make it particularly versatile on medium and deeper complexions.",B+
TOO FACED,SPARKLING PINEAPPLE,Palette,"a mix of warmer neutrals with a pop of sparkling gold and greenish-bronze. It contained two shades that felt more like very dense, cream eyeshadows than powder ones, while the more traditional powder-feeling shades were on the drier side (slightly dusty, thinner) so they did beg for an eyeshadow primer for better pigmentation and wear. I am concerned that the creamier shades may dry out too quickly over time, though, as I noticed that they did not seem as creamy within a few uses as they had initially.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,SOLARIS,Palette,"a chocolate brown and rosy bronze. The shading side worked better than the illuminating side, as the latter was drier and firmer, which made it less comfortable to use. I didn’t find the quality of either side, or the formula generally, to be remarkable in any way, though.
",C+
COLOUR POP,ARE YOU SURREAL,Lipstick,"a deep, raspberry pink with cool, bluish undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good color coverage, though it was shy of full coverage. The texture was denser and slightly firm, so there was a noticeable tug as I applied the color across my lips. The color applied evenly, but there was a touch of product that sank into my lip lines, and it seemed to emphasize my lip texture a bit. It wore well for five and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",B
COLOUR POP,SKY WALKING,Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium red with cool, blue undertones and a nearly matte finish. The lipstick was nearly opaque in a single layer, and the color applied evenly and smoothly across my lips without tugging. There was a touch of emphasis of my overall lip texture in the close-up, but I thought it looked rather smoothing in person. The texture was velvety, lightweight, and glided on easily but didn’t feel slippery or emollient, yet it wasn’t drying when worn. The color stayed on nicely for over six hours and left a reddish stain behind.",A
COLOUR POP,INFINITE BEST,Lipstick,"a deep burgundy with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque in a single layer, while the consistency was velvety and smooth with excellent glide. I think the Matte X formula is underrated; they apply like melting butter but don’t actually slide around. This particular shade gravitated toward my lip lines just slightly but wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance. It was comfortable to wear over the six hours it lasted for, and the formula was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",A
DIOR,ULTRA APPEAL (587),Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with soft, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had rich color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly in a single layer. The consistency was balmy, lightly creamy but not too thick or overly slippery, which made it comfortable to apply and to wear. It developed a slightly clingier feel within a minute of application, but it was never truly clingy. It wore well for five hours and was hydrating while worn.",B
DIOR,ULTRA LIVELY (450),Lipstick,"a medium coral with warm, orange undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was good, though just shy of true full-coverage, and the color went on evenly with very minor settling into my deeper lip lines (not at all noticeable from a normal viewing distance). The texture was lightweight, smooth, and balm-like–glided across like melting butter–but seemed to shift a bit in texture to feel less slippery within a minute or so of application. It stayed on well for four and a half hours on me and was lightly moisturizing over time.",B-
DIOR,ULTRA KISS (555),Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink-coral with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had nearly opaque color payoff in a single layer paired with a smooth, balmy texture that was emollient without being heavy or slippery on my lips. It “set” to feel a touch clingy but not in an uncomfortable to way, more that I could tell it changed in texture to some degree. The color applied evenly and didn’t emphasize my lip lines while it lasted for five hours and was hydrating while worn.",B
OFRA,SPACE BABY,Highlighter,"a bright, bluish-white with a metallic sheen that shifted from icy blue to icy violet. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, almost cream-like, texture that dense but was still soft enough that I could pick up product with typical, tapered highlighting brushes. The highlighter applied evenly to bare skin, blended with ease along the edges, and yielded an intense glow that didn’t emphasize my skin’s natural texture. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before fading slightly.",A
NARS,UNDERWORLD,Palette,"a light-medium silver and a faded, navy blue both with more pearlized/satiny finishes–shiny, smooth but not metallic or frosted. Both shades performed well, better in practice than just swatched, with good pigmentation, blendability, and wear.",A-
NARS,CORDURA,Palette,"two warm-toned browns–a mid-tone and a deep brown–that can definitely be used together for a neutral look or used to complement various other shades one already owns. Cordura I was half of a shade lighter and a touch warmer than the previous formulaw; both reformulated shades were softer, less dry, and more blendable.
",A-
TOO FACED,LEMON ZEST,Eyeshadow,"a medium gold with warm undertones and a mixture of fine and medium-sized glitter particles–it didn’t seem quite as chunky as some of the other shades with respect to the glitter content. It seemed to have a transparent base, so I’m not sure where “full-coverage” has much of a chance to come into play. I could apply the product with a separate synthetic brush, pat it into place, and then build up with a second layer to achieve nearly opaque coverage. The texture was very thin and watery, but it didn’t sting, and it dried down quickly. Once it set, I didn’t see any movement, flaking, or fallout over a 12-hour period.",B
TOO FACED,MACCHIATO MADNESS,Eyeshadow,"a deep, chocolatly brown with multi-colored flekcs of chunky, larger-sized glitter over a pearlescent base. The glitter particles seemed to be dominated by violet and gold. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage using a second layer (just wait for the first one to set). The texture was thin, watery, and easy to spread across the skin, though I was impressed by how evenly the base color applied. It dried down quickly and stayed on well for over 12 hours without fallout, flaking, or creasing.",B+
TOO FACED,CITRUS MISTRESS,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark copper with warm, brown undertones and large, gold glitter. It had semi-sheer to medium coverage between the base color and amount of sparkle/glitter, which applied best (with highest chance at more opaque coverage) with a flat, synthetic brush patted/pressed into place and left to dry. I did not find difficult to use so much as it seemed poorly marketed as it was quite pretty layered over other products or applied on the inner corner to brighten but just wasn’t a full-coverage product (as described). The consistency was watery, which made it very easy to disperse the product across a larger area but did so at the expense of coverage. It dried down quickly and locked into place without fallout for over 10 hours.",C+
TOO FACED,ICE QUEEN,Eyeshadow,"aqua, blue, and iridescent flecks of glitter suspended in a blue-tinted transparent base. Again, I’m not sure why these are marketed as “full-coverage,” as the base here seems intentionally sheer, and while it has a good amount of glitter, it wouldn’t be enough to offer opaque coverage in a single layer. The formula was somewhat buildable from semi-sheer to medium, but it was most usable as a layering product, whether that was over an eyeshadow, or eyeliner. It could be brushed and gently blended out as a wash of glitter on the lid with fingertips, though I think other shades worked better for that particular purpose. The texture was thin and watery, which made it easy to spread the product out, and it dried down quickly, so it didn’t get into my fine lines as it was drying down. Once it set, I didn’t notice any fallout or migration over the 12 hours I tested it for.",C+
DIOR,ULTRA LIGHT (000),Lipstick,"a pale white with cool undertones and a satin finish. The brand says that this shade can be worn alone for a more dramatic look but can also be used to lighten other shades. It had the same, balm-like texture as other shades,, so it felt smooth, lightly creamy, and had some slip as it glided across my lips. With the lightness of the shade, though, the balminess made it harder to apply evenly and showed slight product that sank into my deeper lip lines. I could see lightly applying this to the center of the lips and gently blending out with fingertips to lighten one’s natural lip color a bit in addition to mixing it with other shades. It had good pigmentation that lasted well for four hours (but nowhere near the 12 hours claimed!), and the formula felt hydrating over time.",C
DIOR,ULTRA NIGHT (111),Lipstick,"a deep black with a cool, plummy base and a satin finish. This shade is also marketed as a standalone shade as well as to be used to darken other shades in the range. It had good color coerage that applied fairly evenly, but I could tell that it wasn’t quite opaque nor totally even along the center of my lips where it didn’t adhere as well. The texture was lightweight, creamy and balm-like without being too slippery or thick on my lips. The texture seemed to “set” slightly and felt clingier but not actually clingy. It wore well for five hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.",C+
MAC,OH NO SHE BETA DON'T,Palette,"a new, limited edition set that contains an eyeshadow quad and a liquid lipstick. One shade in the eyeshadow quad was a total fail, while the other three eyeshadows and the liquid lipstick were decent to good, but at this price point, one would expect no fails.",C
TOO FACED,STRAWBERRIES AND CHAMPAGNE,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium copper with warm undertones and chunky, gold glitter. It had medium coverage in a single layer when patted/pressed onto the skin, which was buildable to mostly opaque coverage using a second layer after the first layer had finished drying down. The liquid eyeshadow was watery and on the thin side, so it felt quite wet going on but did not tingle. It dried down quickly and did not have a chance to get into my fine lines, thankfully. It wore well for over 12 hours as I didn’t see any signs of fallout or migration during that time period.",B
TOO FACED,GUAVA GLITZ,Eyeshadow,"iridescent glitter in a transparent base (clear as far as I could tell). It twinkled lavender, gold, and silver depending on the angle, but it often looked lighter and more pale lavender than gold on me. The consistency was thin, watery, and spreadable with a quick dry-down time that kept it from sinking into my fine lines. It had medium to semi-opaque coverage when pressed/patted onto an area and left to dry, but I recommend using a separate applicator to avoid over-applying product. It seemed to wear well for 12 hours as there was no fallout or migration over time.",B+
TOO FACED,SWEET SPOT,Eyeshadow,"a medium, coppery brown with warm undertones and flecks of chunky, gold glitter. It had semi-sheer pigmentation that was buildable to medium coverage but fell quite short of full coverage. It worked best as a layering product over eyeliner or other eyeshadows. The texture was thin, watery but spreadable, with a quick dry-down time that kept it from creasing prematurely. Once it set, the eyeshadow stayed in place well for over 12 hours without any visible fallout or glitter migration over time.
",B-
TOO FACED,"HONEY, PLEASE",Eyeshadow,"a medium, rosy copper with subtle, warm undertones and gold and silver glitter. It had semi-opaque coverage in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with a second layer (be sure to let the first one dry down!). It had a thin, watery consistency that made it easy to spread across a larger area. The eyeshadow stayed on well for 12 hours without flaking, migrating, or having visible fallout.",B+
DIOR,ULTRA TENDER (325),Lipstick," a soft, peachy-beige with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had a really smooth, creamy consistency that felt more balm-like going on but still delivered rich, opaque pigmentation in a single layer. The lipstick applied evenly and didn’t emphasize my lip lines, and while it felt a little balmy initially, it “set” to a more velvety texture that didn’t have noticeable slip but was still comfortable to wear. It was lightly hydrating while worn over four hours, but it did not wear anywhere near the 12-hours claimed, unfortunately.
",B-
DIOR,ULTRA TOUGH (600),Lipstick,"a deep mauve with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. The color payoff was opaque and applied smoothly and evenly across my lips. It had a lightweight, creamy consistency that felt like an emollient balm initially but had a slight “setting” feel where it clung more to my lips but still remained movable and lightly shiny. It stayed on well for five hours and was hydrating while worn.",B
DIOR,ULTRA LUST (485),Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark pink with soft, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single stroke, which applied evenly and smoothly across my lips without dragging. The color didn’t emphasize my lip lines and felt lightweight on. The consistency felt a touch clingier within a minute of wear, almost like it was setting a bit, but it was still movable/flexible. I had higher hopes that that feeling would translate into longer wear, but it lasted for four and a half hours–not at all close to the 12-hour mark. It was moderately moisturizing while worn, though!",B-
JOUER,ROSE GOLD,Palette,"a new, limited edition duo that features a mid-tone, shimmery coral and a light-medium, satiny pink. Both shades had good pigmentation and applied well to bare skin, though Marigold was slightly better all-around.
",A-
NARS,PATTAYA,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium copper with warm, orange undertones and a sparkling, glittery finish. It was jam-packed with glitter and sparkle, so I found it hard to use it dry without getting a fair amount of fallout. It had semi-sheer coverage applied dry, and it intensified to opaque coverage when applied dampened (which is as described). It didn’t have fallout when applied with a dampened brush, and it was easier to blend out without losing coverage, too. There was slight fallout over the eight hours it lasted for when applied with a dampened brush, but it had much more noticeable fallout over time when used dry.",B-
NARS,RIO DE LA PLATA,Eyeshadow,"a pale gold with warm, peachy undertones and a sparkling, glittery finish. It had sheer to semi-sheer coverage when applied with a dry brush and slight fallout over bare skin; it had less fallout just applied over a primer than I expected, but it was best applied using a dampened brush. Applied with a dampened brush, it had opaque pigmentation with a shiny, sparkling finish that was instantly brightening wherever I put it. It had a touch of fallout over time but held up rather well over eight hours with a wet application whereas dry application had moderate fallout over time.",B-
NARS,TULUM,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium brown with warm, yellow undertones and a matte finish. The pigmentation was fantastic, while the texture was smooth, velvety, and finely-milled without being powdery (nor too firmly-pressed in the pan). It applied evenly, blended out with ease, and stayed on well for eight hours on me.",A
NARS,MEKONG,Eyeshadow,"a deep brown with neutral-to-cool undertones and a matte finish with micro-sparkle on top. The sparkles actually adhered to my skin better than anticipated, though the texture didn’t feel overly dense or cream-like; definitely more of a traditional powder eyeshadow. It had opaque pigmentation with a smooth, velvety texture that wasn’t powdery but was fairly blendable on my skin. It stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me before fading slightly.",A
NARS,FEZ,Eyeshadow,"a medium bronze-shimmered brown with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, soft (without being powdery) consistency that applied evenly to bare skin. The eyeshadow blended out effortlessly and had noticeable shine without emphasizing lid texture–I really feel like the market could use more shades in this finish. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.",A
JOUER,ROSE GOLD,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark, rosy copper with warm, red undertones and a metallic finish. The redder tone of it made this shade less dupable compared to others I thought to compare it to. It had nearly opaque color coverage in a single layer with a smooth, lightweight texture that was creamy, not too thin or too thick, and comfortable to wear. The color spread evenly across my lips and didn’t emphasize my lip lines. It wore well for four and a half hours and was hydrating while worn.
",A-
JOUER,MOLTEN GOLD,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark, bronzy gold with a mix of light and medium gold sparkle. It had sheer coverage–which was as described (“sheer veil”)– that covered my lips evenly and didn’t gather into my lip lines. The consistency was smooth, lightweight, and almost creamy in a way, though it was thinner so it didn’t slide around too easily during wear. It had a shiny finish that made it look stunning from a distance and live up to its “molten” descriptor. I could feel some of the sparkles, though, so if that’s a deal-breaker, beware. It stayed on well for four hours on its own and was lightly hydrating.",A-
YVES SAINT LAURENT,ROSE OR,Highlighter,"a soft, peachy-coral with warm, rosy undertones and a sparkling sheen. There were faint micro-sparkles strewn throughout the powder, and it was rather luminous, though had medium and higher coverage, it seemed to emphasize my skin’s texture a touch. The pigmentation was semi-sheer, buildable but had to be used with a dampened brush to get more semi-opaque to opaque coverage. Unfortunately, the stiffer, more firmly pressed texture made it less blendable dry but very difficult to soften those edges when used wet. It wore well for eight hours on me before it started to fade noticeably.",C+
NARS,ALHAMBRA,Palette,"a soft peach and medium gold both with more metallic finishes, but they were shiny rather than overtly shimmery and seemed to melt when applied to bare skin (in a good way). Both shades were pigmented, easy to use, and lasted for eight hours when I tested them. It was slightly firmer (almost creamier) compared to the previous formula, and I noticed that Alhambra I is slightly lighter/pinker.",A
NARS,ISOLDE,Palette,"two metallic hues–mid-tone copper and warm bronze–that can be popped out of the compact for mixing and matching. Both shades had opaque pigmentation, long-wear, and were easy to apply and blend out on bare skin. Isolde I seemed half of a shade darker (not quite as golden) compared to the original duo, while the texture of both shades was slightly denser (less yielding) compared to the original, though I didn’t notice any actual difference in quality or application.",A
BITE BEAUTY,VIRGO,Lipstick,"a medium-dark red with cool, pinkish undertones and a subtle, muted quality to the color that seemed true to the brand’s description of “grapey-red.” The consistency was smooth, lightly creamy, and dense with a touch of tackiness, which helped it apply evenly without sliding around while worn. It had opaque pigmentation that lasted well for over six hours, and it was moisturizing while worn.
",A+
WET 'N' WILD,BRONZE DYNASTY,Bronzer,"a muted, medium brown with warm, rosy undertones and a golden sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that applied evenly to bare skin and blended out fairly well. The consistency was soft and smooth to the touch with a moderate density that gave it more of a powder-cream hybrid feel overall. It applied best with a denser brush, and I liked buffer brushes as they seemed to distribute the bronzer well to bare skin and blended out the edges more readily than fluffier brushes. There was a natural sheen on my skin that was noticeable but did not accentuate my skin’s natural texture. It stayed on well for eight hours on me before I noticed slight fading.",B
MAC,BOY ABOUT TOWN,Palette,"a new, limited edition set that contains an eyeshadow quad and a liquid lipstick. Nothing in the kit was anything to write home about; the eyeshadow quad was surprisingly disappointing as I struggled to blend and diffuse the colors on my lids. The liquid lipstick was decent but lacked opacity (based on the claims of the formula).",C+
MAC,SPRINGSHEEN,Blush,"a medium, pink-coral with golden shimmer. It had medium, buildable pigmentation–and it was listed as “Sheertone Shimmer” for its official finish–but it was easy to apply two to three layers and get near-opaque coverage. The texture was smooth to the touch, dense and a little on the firmer side, though I didn’t have any issues picking up product with a standard blush brush and moderate hand. The finish was noticeably shimmery but did not emphasize my skin’s natural texture. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before it started to fade noticeably.
",A-
OFRA,CLOUD 9,Highlighter,"a soft, pale vanilla with a pink-to-peach shifting pearl. It had opaque pigmentation with a luminous sheen–it was far more subtle than I expected compared to past experiences with the brand’s highlighters. If I applied another layer, it did intensify the shine/shimmer, but I could easily see this working for those who prefer a light-to-moderate finish in their highlighters. The consistency was smooth, lightly creamy, and picked up well with a brush and diffused easily across my cheek bones. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before fading noticeably.
",A
MAC,DAZZLEGOLD,Highlighter,"a bright, light-medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a glittery finish. It had a transparent base, which was as described, and lots of gold pearl, sparkle, and larger flecks of glitter. It had “coverage” with respect to the shimmer/glitter that adhered and stayed on my cheekbones. The texture was dense and smooth to the touch (almost felt like a firm cream), and despite being quite glittery, it picked up well with my brush and actually blended out (without disappearing). It stayed on well for eight hours with minimal migration over time.",A
WET 'N' WILD,WINTER FALLS IN LA,Highlighter,"a pale, warm white with a pearl that shifted from green to blue paired with a metallic finish. The consistency was soft, smooth, and blendable without being too firmly not too softly pressed in the pan. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that applied evenly to bare skin and diffused easily along the edges. The highlighter gave a noticeable sheen on my skin but did not accentuate my skin’s natural texture. This shade lasted well for seven and a half hours on me before fading noticeably.",B+
WET 'N' WILD,YOU'RE DRAGON ME DOWN,Bronzer,"a medium-dark brown with strong, warm yellow undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good color payoff in a single layer, while the texture was dense, smooth to the touch, and almost felt like a powdery cream texture to me. The denser texture required a denser brush to pick up product evenly and also to disperse and blend out the bronzer on my skin. It didn’t take too much effort to even out and diffuse the edges, but it was less workable if I applied it over foundation that wasn’t matte or mostly dried down. Most powders do just fine that way but I’ve seen some that are more reactive, and the latter works better over just-powdered or matte skin. This shade lasted for eight hours on me before it started to fade.",B+
TOO FACED,RAZZLE DAZZLE BERRY,Palette,"a new, permanent palette featuring seven shades across different finishes and depths. It is a pink/plum/purple themed palette. Two shades–Razzle and That’s My Jam–feature a much more cream-based formula, which is denser, smooth, and applied best with synthetic brushes. The palette came together with enough effort, but it was a weaker showing.",B
TOO FACED,PLUM CRAZY,Lipgloss,"a deep berry with subtle, cool undertones and fine, violet and fuchsia sparkle. It had semi-sheer coverage that did not apply as evenly as it could have, though I was surprised it didn’t pull into my lip lines more noticeably. The gloss felt a bit thinner than other shades in the range, though it was still smooth and spreadable with some tackiness present. It wore well for five and a half hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",B
TOO FACED,WHO GIVES A FIG,Lipgloss,"a blackened plum with subtle, cool undertones and a mix of violet and red micro-sparkle. This was one of the less shimmery/sparkly shades in the range, and it only had semi-opaque pigmentation from the underlying base color. The texture was lightweight, smooth, and lightly tacky without being heavy or tacky, but it did settle into my lip lines noticeably. It stayed on well for five hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.",B-
TOO FACED,BLUE YOU AWAY,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark bluish-teal with cool undertones and fine blue and teal pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied decently, but it could have spread more evenly across my lips. There was slight product that settled into my deeper lip lines, but the mirror-like finish made it hard to tell from a normal viewing distance. It had a smooth, spreadable consistency with some tackiness but was lightweight and comfortable to wear. The color lasted well for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",B
MAC,SUNBASQUE,Blush,"a medium copper with warm, rusty undertones and fine, gold and copper pearl. It had semi-sheer (as expected, based on the “Sheertone Shimmer” finish), buildable pigmentation–up to semi-opaque in three layers–with a drier, dustier texture that didn’t feel particularly promising by touch, but it applied better than anticipated! I remember it being smoother years ago, but memories get fuzzy when a decade passes (I think Sunbasque might have been my second blush purchase, pre-blog era!). The blush applied evenly to bare skin, blended out effortlessly, and sat well on my skin without emphasizing my skin’s texture but still producing a noticeable sheen–more shine than overt shimmer. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before fading slightly.",A-
MAC,DAZZLEPINK,Highlighter,"a light-medium peach with pink-to-peach shifting glitter. As described, the base was transparent, but there was plenty of “coverage” in the form of sparkle and flecks of flatter glitter particles. This translated into a noticeably glittery, highly reflective finish that was sparkly but not dirt-like at some angles (an issue with some glitters) due to the flat shape. The powder felt smooth, dense and more cream-like, but it picked up well with a tapered, highlighting brush and adhered evenly to bare skin. It wore well for eight hours with minimal migration/movement of the glitter over time.",A
COLOUR POP,ORIGAMI,Eyeshadow,"a medium gold with strong, warm yellow undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. The pigmentation was mostly opaque in a single layer with a smooth, watery consistency that was thin and wet-feeling as soon as it touched my skin, but it didn’t sheer out or turn patchy when I diffused the edges and spread it across my lid area. It didn’t blend out easily after it had set, though, which gave me about 10 to 15 seconds of playtime. It wore well for 10 hours without flaking or creasing on me.",A
COLOUR POP,SHORT CIRCUIT,Eyeshadow,"a deep, reddish copper with subtle, warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had opaque color coverage in a single layer, though it wasn’t nearly as metallic as I expected–it even seemed to soften further after it set on me. The consistency was smooth, thin, and definitely felt water-based as the product felt cool on my skin but did dry down quickly (about 10-15 seconds) and set to a transfer- and crease-resistant finish that lasted for over 10 hours.",A
COLOUR POP,VENTURA,Eyeshadow,"a pale, iridescent lavender with cool undertones and a sparkling sheen. It had medium to semi-opaque pigmentation, but it seemed to have a chalkier, almost white base that was most present after it had dried down. The texture was wet to the touch and yielded a cooling sensation on my skin, but it dried down and set within 15 seconds. Once set, the eyeshadow stayed on well for 10 hours without moving or creasing.",B+
COLOUR POP,WE JAMMIN',Eyeshadow,"a pale, white gold with subtle, warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. It had one of the most reflective finishes within the shades released in the formula, and it was extremely brightening (and possibly too intense for brow bone highlighting for most preferences but lovely on the lid and inner tearduct!). The pigmentation was fantastic and applied evenly without sheering out or becoming patchy when blended along the edges–just make sure to do your blending as it’s drying down (about 10-15 seconds). It wore well for 10 hours without fading or creasing on me.",A
TOO FACED,TOTALLY SMASHED,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and silver and fuchsia sparkle. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a smooth, slightly thicker consistency compared to other shades, and it was moderately tacky so it wasn’t quite as comfortable overall. It had good pigmentation that spread evenly across my lips and didn’t emphasize my lip lines. it wore well for five and a half hours and was lightly hydrating while worn.",A-
TOO FACED,FRUIT PUNCH,Lipgloss,"a deep berry with cool undertones and flecks of fine fuchsia pearl along with larger pink and fuchsia sparkle. It had rich color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips. The gloss had a moderate tacky texture, but it was smooth and lightweight, which made it easy to spread and comfortable to wear. It sat well on my lips and stayed on nicely for almost six hours. The formula felt lightly moisturizing over time.",A
TOO FACED,RUBY RIPE,Lipgloss,"a bright, pinky-red with cool undertones and fine red and fuchsia pearl. The gloss had a smooth, spreadable texture that wasn’t too thick or too thin, though it was noticeably tacky (which not everyone enjoys). It had opaque pigmentation in a single layer that adhered well to lips and applied evenly without gathering in my lip lines. The color lasted well for six hours and was hydrating while worn.",A+
COLOUR POP,BUNGALOW,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark emerald green with subtle, warm undertones and a cooler-toned shimmer/sheen. It had semi-opaque with a more emollient base, which made it harder to build up coverage. If I ensured the first layer was fully dry, I could get slightly better pigmentation with a second layer, but it almost seemed to re-hydrate the first layer so it was hard to get truly opaque, even coverage. The texture felt cool and watery initially but set within 30 seconds of application. It was blendable only as long as it was drying down, but once it set, it was locked in place and additional blending was more likely to result in product flaking off/the area becoming patchy. It wore well for 10 hours before starting to crease faintly on me.",B+
COLOUR POP,FOXES,Eyeshadow,"a rich, molten gold with strong, warm orange undertones and a metallic sheen. It was incredibly vibrant, which was what made the shade standout against other similar-hued shades; there was more depth and a more reflective finish. The consistency was wet to the touch, thin, and definitely felt like it was water-based, but it applied with rich, opaque coverage using a flat, synthetic brush and did not look patchy or sheer out. The key was to use a lot less than I thought I’d need, as a little went a long way with this shade (and to some degree, the formula in general). When I used just what I needed, the color dried down within 15 seconds and didn’t feel difficult to work with, but it needed to be blended out quickly as it wasn’t blendable after it dried down. It was still going strong after 10 hours of wear.",A
COLOUR POP,HALF MOON,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark plum with strong, warm red undertones and pink-to-blue shifting pearl. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, while the texture was smooth, lightweight, and watery and felt cool when initially applied. It dried down within 15 seconds of application, but you’ll want to apply less than anticipated as over-applying led to longer dry down times and was more likely to crease as it dried down. I recommend working quickly to diffuse and blend out the edges as it was harder to blend out once it set. It wore well for 10 hours without fading, creasing, or flaking.",A
COLOUR POP,ONCE AND FLORAL,Eyeshadow,"a deep, reddish-copper with subtle, warm undertones and warmer pink-to-orange shifting pearl. It had a soft sheen once it dried down on my lid but did not seem intensely metallic. It was richly pigmented and had a smooth, watery consistency that felt cool to the touch but dried down and set fully within 15 seconds on my lid. This particular shade did seem to dry down and emphasize my lid texture a bit, though, so it was crucial to apply less than I needed to avoid that. I noticed that some of the product lifted/flaked off if I tried to blend out the edges after it had dried down. It stayed on nicely for 10 hours without any further flaking and no creasing.",A-
TOO FACED,STROBEBERRY,Palette,"a new, permanent cheek duo that features a warm pink highlighter and a deeper pink blush. The two shades worked well together, applied evenly, blended out nicely, and lasted for eight and a half hours. The pigmentation was medium to semi-opaque, but the formula was billed at buildable, so it was more in line with expectations.",A-
TOO FACED,GRIN AND BARE IT,Lipgloss,"a light-medium pink with strong, warm undertones, moderate pearl, and a glossy sheen. The consistency was smooth, spreadable, and comfortable to wear with light tackiness but no heaviness, so it didn’t feel glue-like. The color coverage was good, though not opaque, and there was some product that gathered in my lip lines, which wasn’t as noticeable at a normal viewing distance as it was in close-up photos. It wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating over time.]",B+
TOO FACED,HOME SLICE,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium-dark pink with subtle, warm undertones and faint gold pearl. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a creamier quality (and look) compared to the other shades; the pigmentation and creaminess overwhelmed a lot of the golden shimmer, so it did not appear metallic or sparkly. The color applied evenly for the most part but pulled into lip lines a bit more noticeably. The texture was smooth, lightly tacky, but it did feel a but more slippery on my lips. The color stayed on well for four and a half hours and was moisturizing while worn.",B+
TOO FACED,SHOW ME YOUR COCONUTS,Lipgloss,"a medium, peachy brown with warm, orange undertones and fine pearl. The color payoff was opaque in a single layer, while the gloss was smooth, lightweight, and spreadable with moderate tackiness (but not enough to feel glue-like). The product applied evenly, though there was a touch of gloss that sat in my lip lines. The higher-shine finish made this less noticeable from a normal distance. It wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating while worn.",A
WET 'N' WILD,QUEEN'S LAND,Bronzer,"a medium brown with strong, warm orange undertones and a golden sheen. The shimmer was quite fine, so the more I buffed and blended out the bronzer, the more luminous and glowing it appeared (without being overtly shimmery). It had good color coverage in a single layer, which built up to full coverage with less than a half of a layer on top. The consistency was dense, almost like a powdery cream, and it applied best with a small, buffing brush (I used Sonia G. Face Two). It was fairly blendable, but the very edge took a bit more effort to diffuse, and I did notice that it did not play as well with still-drying or dewier foundations (compared to bare skin/matte skin). It wore well for eight hours on me before it started to fade noticeably.",B
TOO FACED,PINEAPPLE PARADISE,Palette,"a new, permanent pairing of a gold highlighter and mid-tone, warm brown. I’ve always been a fan of satin finishes in cheek colors, so I loved how the bronzer sat on my skin once blended out–natural but not metallic. Both shades were more pigmented than not, but the brand described them as having “buildable pigment” and they’re somewhat buildable but would require using a lighter hand (true of very pigmented products in general) to achieve more semi-sheer coverage. They were easy to apply and lasted for eight and a half hours on me.",A-
TOO FACED,YUMMY RUMMY,Lipgloss,"a deep, plummy brown with warm, red undertones and flecks of gold sparkle and finer gold and copper pearl. The gloss had rich color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips without emphasizing my lip lines. It had a lightweight, moderately sticky consistency that was comfortable to wear and easy to work with. This shade stayed on well for six hours and was lightly moisturizing while I wore it.",A
TOO FACED,DREAMSICLE,Lipgloss,"a medium pink with warm undertones and fine, gold, peach, and pink pearl. It had more of a shiny, metallic finish with finer pearl over larger sparkle/glitter compared to some of the other shades. It had good pigmentation, though not quite full coverage, with a smooth, lightweight texture that applied fairly evenly and was easy to spread across my lips. There was slight product that gathered in my lip lines, though I didn’t think it was noticeable from a normal viewing distance (likely in part because of the shine and pearl). It wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating while worn.
",A-
TOO FACED,TAKES TWO TO MANGO,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium orange with warm undertones and fine, gold pearl and larger gold sparkle throughout. The consistency was smooth, lightweight, and comfortable to wear as the product spread easily across my lips and didn’t slide around too readily (it was moderately tacky). It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer with a bit of product getting into my lip lines but wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance. This shade lasted well for five and a half hours and was moisturizing while worn.",A-
MAC,GOLD FX,Highlighter,"a pale, white gold with warm, yellow undertones and a luminous sheen. On lighter skin tones, this could be easily worn on its own, though on my complexion (light to light-medium), it would work best paired with a blush or bronzer as I could see the white base coming through on my cheeks (lightening them). It had sheer, buildable pigmentation, as described, and could be layered easily and did not emphasize my skin’s natural texture or pick up my complexion products when I tried it on top. The liquid highlighter had a thin, watery consistency that spread and mixed easily but wasn’t too runny that it became difficult to get precision application. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,LA NUDITE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium rosy beige with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had good color coverage, though not quite opaque, with a smooth, velvety texture that was incredibly lightweight without feeling slippery–almost waxy as it glided easily across lips but didn’t slide around while worn. I did not find that the formula was particularly smoothing with this shade, and there was a touch of product that sat in my deeper lip lines, though it wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance. It wore well for four hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,NOTORIOUS,Lipstick,"a bright, medium red with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a smooth, firm (but not stiff) texture that felt waxy as it glided across my lips, yet it yielded excellent, even coverage in a single stroke. The lipstick was ultra lightweight, comfortable to wear, and sat well on my lips. It stayed on well for six hours, left a faint stain behind, and was moisturizing while worn.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,LA WOMAN,Lipstick,"a deep, raspberry pink with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was nearly oapque in a single layer, while the texture was smooth, velvety, and glided on with ease, but it didn’t feel slippery or traditionally creamy. This shade lasted well for six hours, left a pinkish stain behind, and was hydrating over time",A
YVES SAINT LAURENT,CORAIL RIVE GAUCHE,Blush,"a soft coral with warm undertones and a golden sheen. The texture was incredibly stiff to the touch, which made it difficult to pick up product on a brush (even with fingertips!) and apply to skin. It was harder to blend and apply the color wet as it seemed not to transfer much from brush to skin. I scraped off layers of product using the end of the brush (the handle part, not the brush head!) to get it to show up on my cheeks. It’s a shame as the finish was luminous with faint micro-sparkle and fine pearl, so it looked nice once I managed to get enough pigment onto my cheeks and worked at it to buff out the edges. It lasted for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.",D-
WET 'N' WILD,HALO WALKERS,Highlighter,"a light-medium blue with subtle, cool undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. The texture was a bit looser with larger, chunkier sparkles, which were more visible on the skin (so you’ll want to love yourself some glitter in your highlight!). It had a sparkling, metallic sheen that didn’t emphasize my skin’s natural texture, and it read more icy white (cool, bluish white) than light-medium blue when applied and diffused on my cheekbones–very appropriate for the Ice theme of the launch. It applied fairly evenly and blended out without too much effort, but the formula wasn’t as good as some of the past MegaGlo Highlighters have been. It wore well for eight hours on me before it started to fade noticeably.",B
WET 'N' WILD,DRAGON SCALES,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette that features a warm, shimmery gold; soft, warm-toned brown; olive green; and deep forest green. I liked the color concept, though I was surprised to see how shimmery the “browbone” shade was–I think a satin or pearl finish would have worked out better to balance out the finishes in the quad. Though they did not wear great on me, they were fairly pigmented and easy to use, so if you’re someone who uses a primer normally, it might still be a good option.
",B
BOBBI BROWN,RAZZBERRY,Lipstick,"a medium-dark plum with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It was intensely pigmented with a smooth, moderately dense consistency that felt more velvety as it went on, though it felt incredibly lightweight on my lips despite having more substance to it. The color applied evenly and sat flatteringly on my lips. It wore well for seven and a half hours and left behind a stain behind. While it didn’t feel drying while worn, it clung to my lips more noticeably after six hours of wear (or after a meal).",B
BOBBI BROWN,VIBRANT VIOLET,Lipstick,"a bright, deep magenta with cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good color coverage, though it needed a second layer for true opaque coverage. The lipstick was smooth, dense but not so firm that it became painful to apply. It distributed color evenly in a single layer, didn’t emphasize my lip lines, and was comfortable to wear as it was very lightweight. The color stayed on well for seven and a half hours and left behind a strong stain. The formula was neither drying nor hydrating, though it clung to my lips a bit more noticeably after five hours of wear.",B
MAC,ROSE GOLD FX,Highlighter,"a medium peach with warm undertones and a fine, gold and pink pearl. It had sheer to medium, buildable color coverage with a thin, watery consistency that had enough substance that it spread well over skin without lifting base products or sheering out too easily. It still mixed well with liquid foundations or moisturizers for all-over glow. I didn’t notice that this changed the tint of my foundation, just made it dewier in finish. This shade was very “my-skin-but-better” when applied on top of my bare skin or over foundation as it blended in with my actual skin tone. It seemed to have slightly finer pearl compared to some of the other shades and didn’t have quite the same level of shine. This shade stayed on well for eight hours on me.",A-
MAC,SILVER DUSK,Highlighter,"a soft beige with subtle, warm undertones and flecks of sparkle and finer pearl strewn throughout. I found that it had larger sparkle in it than Golden Bronze, though the effect was similar on the skin: glowing, luminous, but not metallic or in pore-emphasizing territory. There were a few bits of sparkle on my skin, which I know some love and some loathe.

The powder had a soft, silky consistency but didn’t disperse too readily into the air (sometimes those loose powders can be too airy in a way), so it was easy to apply more or less depending on how intense I wanted the finish to be. I didn’t feel like it was a product where I had to apply a lot of layers to get to intense shine but I was just as easily able to achieve a subtle glow if preferred. As it was beige, it didn’t really add “color” to my skin, though I could see the lighter base brightening the area I applied it to. It went on evenly, blended out almost on its own, and lasted well for eight hours.",A
WET 'N' WILD,THE NIGHT'S QUAD,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette that featured a light taupe, yellow beige, medium black, and frosted silver. It wasn’t one of the brand’s best efforts–the textures were either dry or powdery, prone to sheering out, less blendable, and had poorer wear.",B-
BOBBI BROWN,BITTEN PEACH,Lipstick,"a bright pop of pink-coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. It wore down to a matte finish within two hours of wear, but it was more in the “velvet matte” category than true, flat matte (think the typical liquid lipstick). It had opaque pigmentation in a single layer with a denser, slightly firmer texture that took a couple of uses before it glided easily across my lips. It didn’t drag, but I did find myself using more pressure than normal. There was a touch of product that sat in my deeper lip lines, though it wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The biggest downside was that it did not last anywhere near 12 hours–five hours and didn’t make it through a meal well. The formula was comfortable to wear as it felt very lightweight, and it was non-drying.",B-
BOBBI BROWN,NUDE REALITY,Lipstick,"a soft, medium pink with strong, warm undertones and a satin finish. There was a soft sheen to it that took a couple of hours to wear down to a true matte finish (or one could blot and go matte from the get-go). The lipstick had a smooth, lightweight texture that was dense, almost velvety over creamy, as it was firmer and took more pressure to apply but I wouldn’t describe it as tugging or dragging at all. The color applied evenly but there was slight product that gathered in my deeper lip lines. It wore well for four and a half hours and was comfortable and not at all drying over time.",C+
BOBBI BROWN,TAWNY PINK,Lipstick,"a muted, medium mauve with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. The lipstick was smooth, velvety, and just creamy enough not to tug or drag across my lips. It delivered opaque pigmentation in a single layer that went on evenly, though there was a bit of product that pulled into my deeper lip lines. I did not find it too noticeable in person until after a few hours of wear as the color wore away. This shade stayed on nicely for five hours and was neither drying nor hydrating over time.",B-
MAC,BRONZE FX,Highlighter,"a medium, coppery-brown with warm, golden pearl. It had buildable pigmentation from semi-sheer to mostly opaque (two to three layers) that sat well on bare skin without emphasizing my skin’s natural texture. This particular shade gave me subtle color and tint, so it would likely to be very my-skin-but-better on medium to tan complexions in particular. The consistency was lightweight, thin, and watery without being too runny or prone to sheering out to barely-there coverage. I didn’t have any trouble applying it to my cheek bones as a standalone highlighter and getting a moderate shine and some color. This shade stayed on nicely for eight and a half hours on my skin.",A
WET 'N' WILD,GLOW WATCHER,Highlighter,"a pale, bluish-silver with subtle, cool undertones and a metallic sheen with slightly larger bits of sparkle strewn throughout. The powder had a fairly smooth, lightly dusty consistency that made it easy to apply and blend out on my skin, which can be key when working with a less conventional highlighting shade. It had a moderate sheen but did not emphasize my skin’s natural texture. I felt like this “warmed up” noticeable on my skin tone and looked more like a very light white in practice, particularly when paired with other products (like blush or bronzer). It had good color coverage that stayed on well for seven and a half hours on me.",A-
KKW BEAUTY,CLASSIC,Palette,"a warm-toned, neutral palette with a mix of mattes and shimmers (though only three shimmers). While the colors may feel overdone to those who have already enjoyed quite a few palettes over the last few years, the palette performed well, so a high-performing product is always welcome in my book! I was impressed by the mattes as they had a “thicker” consistency that made them more pigmented but still very blendable and easy to build up if preferred.",A-
MAC,JAMIE GENEVIEVE,Lipstick,"a medium peach with soft, warm yellow undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer that applied smoothly without dragging on my lips. The color applied evenly but pulled away along my lip lines a bit. The lipstick had a lightweight, creamy texture with slight tackiness but adhered well for four and a half hour wear. It was neither drying nor hydrating over time.

This shade is available in the UK now and has a global launch of November.",A-
MAC,PATRICIA BRIGHT,Lipstick,"a deep brown with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. The consistency was smooth, lightweight, and creamy with moderate slip that made it comfortable and easy to apply in a single, fluid motion. It had rich color coverage that applied evenly and stayed on well for five hours. The formula felt neither drying nor hydrating over time.

This shade is available in the UK now and has a global launch of November.",A
YVES SAINT LAURENT,BRONZE GOLD,Highlighter,"a light-medium copper with warm, red undertones and a golden, metallic sheen. It had medium, buildable pigmentation (three layers for nearly opaque coverage) with a stiffer, firmer consistency that was harder to pick up with my brush. It blended out fairly readily when applied dry, but when I applied it with a wet brush, it was more challenging to blend out as the product adhered strongly wherever it was initially applied. I was able to buff out the edges for a luminous finish that did not emphasize my skin’s natural texture in the end, but it was a surprise that I had to work at blending out the color at all. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.
",B-
MAC,GOLDEN BRONZE,Highlighter,"a soft, peachy brown with warm undertones and a fine, golden pearl that yielded a moderate glow. It was glowing without emphasizing my skin’s natural texture, and it did had color to my skin tone–it looked a bit like a highlighting bronzer on my skin tone and would be more my-skin-but-better on medium-tan and deeper complexions.

The consistency was silky, smooth, and easy to blend, and it had enough weight to the mix that it didn’t fly everywhere when I initially picked it up, though you’ll want to tap off excess into the pot or cap if you tend to be heavy handed. It had good pigmentation, but a lighter hand or picking up less product made it more buildable if one preferred. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.",A
MAC,SPOIL YOURSELF,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium-dark pink with warm undertones and a pearly, glossy finish. It had good color coverage in a single layer, which spread evenly across my lips and stayed out of most of my lip lines, though it pulled into a few of them (mostly visible on the upper lip). The gloss had a smooth, spreadable texture that was moderately sticky but comfortable to wear over the five hours it lasted for. The formula felt neither drying nor hydrating on me.",A-
MAC,SUGAR POPPY,Lipgloss,"a light-medium, cotton candy pink with cool, blue undertones and fine blue and pink pearl. It had semi-sheer to medium color payoff in a single layer, which applied evenly but settled into my lip lines noticeably (one of the worst offenders in the range). The texture was lightweight but more medium in thickness with some tackiness, which helped it stay on better (four hours of wear). It was lightly hydrating while worn.",B-
COLOUR POP,SIX IN THE CITY,Eyeshadow,"a medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and flecks of gold sparkle over a mostly matte finish. The texture was smooth, sponge-like, and a bit drier than most Super Shock Shadows, and I did find the base was more prone to emphasizing my lid texture due to that drier, almost more clay-like feel. It applied better with fingertips than brushes, and the latter I am typically able to use with most Super Shock Shadows. It wore well for nine hours with some fallout over time.
",B+
COLOUR POP,6AM,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium coral-orange with warm undertones and flecks of soft orange sparkle. The base seemed more matte, which resulted in a drier consistency that was harder to apply evenly as the sparkles seemed to break up the base and give a patchy appearance when applied with a brush. I was only able to smooth and even out the coverage if I pressed my fingertip down with moderate pressure. It had opaque pigmentation that stayed on well for nine hours with slight fallout over time.",B
COLOUR POP,QUICK SIX,Eyeshadow,"a rich, coppery red with warm undertones and flecks of gold and pink. The consistency was dense, spongy, and drier to the touch (but not actually stiff/dry) compared to some of the more shimmery Super Shock Shadows. It had opaque pigmentaiton that applied evenly to bare skin and blended out easily along the edge, though there were some sparkles that dropped off the lid during blending. It wore well for 10 hours on me without fading or creasing.
",A
COLOUR POP,RUNNIN' THRU THE SIX,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, bluish-teal with faint pearl over a matte finish. It looked mostly matte in practice. The texture was smooth, lightly creamy, so I had no trouble getting opaque coverage in a single layer but was still able to diffuse and blend along the edges like a powder eyeshadow. It showed no signs of fading or creasing after 10 hours of wear.",A+
COLOUR POP,SIXTH SENSE,Eyeshadow,"a medium gold with moderate, warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied somewhat evenly on bare skin, but it was harder to build up due to the more emollient quality of the texture. It lasted well for 10 hours with slight fall out over time.",B+
COLOUR POP,THE SIX,Eyeshadow,"a deep, bronzy gold with warm, rusty undertones and a golden sheen. It was like a mix of brown, gold, and copper altogether, which made it harder to dupe compared to the other shades launched alongside it. The consistency was smooth, lightly emollient but not too slippery, which made it easy to apply and blend out while still yielding rich color payoff in a single layer. This shade stayed on well for 10 hours without creasing or fading.",A+
SEPHORA,STONE,Eyeliner,"a deep gray with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had a smooth, waxy consistency that gave it a touch of creaminess without any wet-feel. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single stroke, which was easy to apply as it never tugged or dragged on my lower lash line. This shade lasted well for 10 hours on me before it started to thin slightly.",A
SEPHORA,T-REX,Eyeliner,"a medium-dark green with subtle, warm undertones and a metallic sheen. The color coverage was nearly opaque in a single layer, and it was easily built up to opaque coverage applied in shorter, slightly overlapping strokes or with a second layer. The eyeliner was incredibly smooth, lightly creamy, and comfortable to apply across the water line and lower lash line. It wore beautifully for 10 and a half hours on me.",A
SEPHORA,WATERFALL,Eyeliner,"a dark, bluish-teal with cool undertones and a metallic sheen. The pigmentation was good, just shy of opaque coverage, and was easily built up to full coverage with less than half of a layer on top. The texture was lightly creamy, smooth, and easy to apply in a fluild layer as it never dragged or tugged. It stayed on well for 10 and a half hours on me.",A
MAC,POLAR FLEECE,Lipgloss,"a pale pink with subtle, cool undertones and pink and silver pearl. It looked significantly darker applied to my lips, and I triple checked the shade because it was so different… and also ridiculously similar to Party Sparkle, even when worn side-by-side! The consistency was lightweight, more medium in thickness with some tackiness, but the gloss itself felt smooth and spread fairly well across my lips. There was a slight bit of product that gathered in my deeper lip lines, while the color coverage was more semi-sheer than “megawatt.” It wore well for four hours and felt non-drying.
",B-
MAC,RUBY PRINCESS,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium purple with warm undertones and a pearly, metallic sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a smooth, light-medium thick consistency that was tacky but comfortable to wear and spread easily across my lips. The gloss helped smooth out my natural lip lines rather than fill them. It lasted nicely for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A
MAC,SWEET AS COCOA,Blush,"a muted, medium-dark plum-brown with faint gold sparkle over a satin finish. Though this particular shade was labeled a “Sheertone Shimmer,” I wouldn’t describe it as sheer in terms of coverage; medium to semi-opaque coverage that was then buildable from there. The consistency was drier, slightly firmer in the pan, so if I used a lighter hand, I could get less coverage, but this is generally true of most powder product and less so that it is inherent in the formula. It was, though, “just enough shimmer” that gave it more of a natural sheen–glowing but not overtly shimmery–once buffed and blended on my cheeks. I didn’t have any trouble diffusing the edges of the blush, which I worried about initially. The color lasted well for eight and a half hours on me.",B+
MAC,BEAM TIME,Eyeshadow,"a medium copper with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. This was the least sparkly shade that I tried, and it had a stronger, more metallic sheen with less larger sparrkle in it. It was also more semi-opaque in a single layer, though it could easily be sheered out (or applied with less product) for sheerer results. I was also able to dab on a second layer to get full coverage. It had a smooth, thin texture that wasn’t quite as watery as other shades, and it applied evenly, blended out nicely, and dried down fast enough that it didn’t settle into fine lines/lid lines. The color lasted well for nine hours without creasing or yielding fallout.
",A-
MAC,EVERY DAY IS SUNSHINE,Eyeshadow,"a pale, pinky-beige with warm gold, silver, and pink sparkle. The consistency was thin and watery, but it spread fairly evenly on my skin for a sheer, even layer of shimmer/sparkle. It dried down fast enough that it didn’t pull into my fine lines but gave me enough time to buff the edges with a small eye brush. This shade worked well for brightening the inner tearduct/corner or layering over most eyeshadows to add a little bit of sparkle. It wore well for eight hours with minimal fallout and no creasing.
",A
MAC,LOVE YOURSELF,Eyeshadow,"a medium pink with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. It had sheer color coverage, as described, that was buildable to mostly opaque coverage with to three layers. The texture was noticeably thicker and emphasized my lid texture, but sparkled prettily from a normal viewing distance that it wasn’t a deal-breaker for me, plus it didn’t flake off over time. The liquid eyeshadow was wet to the touch, watery, and thin, but it dried down quickly but still gave me a few seconds to diffuse and soften the edges. It stayed on well for eight hours with slight fallout but no creasing.",A
MAC,PANTHERTIZED,Eyeshadow,"a black base with violet and green sparkle/pearl. It had sheer coverage, which seemed to be in line with the brand’s description (“wash” of color), but the sheer black base was uneven and splotchy–almost like powdery bits on the lid. I would recommend using this shade to layer over deeper shades, like a matte black eyeshadow or deep purple, to add sparkle/shine. The consistency was more watery than the other shades I tried, and I found a brush to give me the most control over where and how much applied to my lid. On me, it had slight fallout after eight hours of wear but no creasing.",B
MAC,IT'S JUST CANDY,Lipgloss,"a bright, pinky-red with lots of fine pink and red pearl with a few bits of sparkle. (I really just wanted to go with the obvious “candy apple red” description here.) The texture was smooth, light-medium in thickness but lightweight, and had moderate tackiness. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered fairly evenly, though in the close-up, I can tell it did not go on quite as evenly as other shades in the formula have for me. This shade stayed on well for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",B+
MAC,JUST HUSTLIN',Lipgloss,"a darker, beige base with iridescent shimmer and pearl–lots of cooler-toned pearl in violet, aqua, and blue. It brought out a lot of pink tones in my natural lip color–came out looking pinker than I expected as the base was semi-opaque–with a moderate amount of pearl. It had a smooth consistency that applied evenly and spread well with moderate tackiness. I appreciated that the gloss helped minimize my lip lines and helped my lips appear smoother overall. It wore well for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
MAC,PARTY SPARKLE,Lipgloss,"a pale pink with cool undertones and a pearly, metallic sheen. It looked more like a medium pink applied, as it brought out the pink tones in my natural lip color, which came through noticeably due to the medium coverage level. The gloss had a smooth, moderately thick consistency with noticeable tackiness, though it didn’t feel heavy to me. The color applied fairly evenly but didn’t smooth out my lip lines quite as well as other shades have in the same formula (but from afar, I didn’t notice any settling). It stayed on well for four hours and was non-drying.",B
MAC,VIOLET FX,Highlighter,"a pale lavender with a cool, pink pearl sheen. It had semi-sheer, buildable pigmentation, so it had a subtle, violet sheen on bare skin when applied all-over and layered underneath foundation but could still be worn as a standalone highlighter on the high points of the face and be visible. The liquid highlighter’s consistency was lightweight, thin, and watery with some slip, which helped it adhere well to bare skin without breaking up my foundation. It sat well on bare skin or dabbed on top of liquid foundation, as it had a natural sheen that wasn’t overtly shimmer. It wore well for nine hours on me before fading slightly.",A+
MAC,AUTUMN RUSSET,Lipgloss,"a medium copper with warm, reddish undertones and fine gold, pink, and copper pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which was slightly buildable, but it allowed my natural lip color to come through and resulted in a rosier tone to it than I think the color actually had on its own. The consistency was smooth, moderately sticky, and comfortable to wear, and the gloss didn’t well up in my lip lines. It wore well for four hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A-
MAC,DANCE ALL NIGHT,Lipgloss,"a medium pink with subtle, cool undertones and a metallic, lightly glossy finish. The gloss had semi-opaque pigmentation with a smooth, light-medium thick consistency that was moderately tacky (took a few minutes to get there) but applied evenly across my lips and didn’t emphasize my lip lines. It stayed on well for four hours and was non-drying.",B+
MAC,GOLDIELOXXED,Lipgloss,"a medium bronze with warm, orange undertones and a glossy, metallic finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage in a single layer, which resulted in letting my natural lip color come through noticeably and made the color appear rosier. The gloss had a light-medium thickness but felt lightweight and comfortable to wear with a moderately sticky texture that was comfortable to wear and easy to spread across my lips. It wore well for four hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",A-
SEPHORA,MIDNIGHT BLUE,Eyeliner,"a blackened navy blue with a sparkling finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The texture was fairly smooth, though I could tell it was a more glittery eyeliner, and didn’t drag or tug on my lower lash line when I tried to apply it in a fluid stroke. It stayed on well for 10 hours before fading/thinning noticeably.",B+
SEPHORA,PEACOCK BLUE,Eyeliner,"a bright, medium blue with subtle, cool undertones and a pearly sheen. The pigmentation was nearly opaque in a single layer, and it just needed a little bit more on top in places to achieve full coverage. The eyeliner had a smooth, lightly creamy texture that glided across my lash line without tugging but did not feel too creamy or slip into my fine lines. It wore well for 10 hours on me before showing signs of wear.",A-
SEPHORA,SANGRIA,Eyeliner,"a medium-dark plum with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had decent pigmentation, but it noticeably darkened when layered, so it actually transitioned from plum to blackened plum with two to three layers. The consistency was a touch drier, but it wasn’t stiff or overly firm and didn’t tug on my lash line when I applied it in a single stroke. It was most even when I applied one layer, as three layers made it appear a touch patchy if I looked closely (it’s eyeliner; we’re talking millimeters of thickness!). This shade stayed on well for 10 and a half hours on me.",B
MAC,HARMONY,Blush,"a muted, medium-brown with subtle, warm rosy undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was smooth, velvety, and more blendable than I ever recall this shade being in the past–very pigmented, but soft enough that I could use a lighter hand to apply less product and build up coverage if preferred. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.",A-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,PERFECT-O,Eyeshadow,"a bright, yellow-leaning beige with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had rich color coverage but was somewhat powdery in the pan, which led to slight fallout during application, though it had good adhesion to bare skin and was more pigmented than other similar-colored shades with this type of texture. It did seem to look more white-based when I applied it to my brow bone and didn’t play as well as with other shades due to that stronger white base coming through. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading.
",B
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,PRIM-O,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium peachy-beige with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. The consistency was smooth to the touch, dense and almost cream-like, but I didn’t struggle to pick up product with my brush nor did I have issues getting it to apply evenly to my lid. (I also tried this shade as a cheek highlighter here.) It was extremely metallic and very brightening wherever it was applied. It stayed on well for nine hours on me before starting to fade slightly.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,BRAV-O,Eyeshadow,"a golden bronze with warm underto nes and a pearly sheen. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, while the texture was smooth, lightly creamy, and blendable without being too loosely nor too firmly pressed in the pan, which mitigated concerns about fallout while still ensuring even adherence to bare skin. This shade lasted beautifully for nine and a half hours on me before it started to fade a bit.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,O MG,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark copper with warm undertones and a pearl finish. It had good pigmentation, which was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The texture was smooth with slight slip, as it was dense and not at all powdery, but it wasn’t stiff to work with and picked up well with a brush. The color applied fairly evenly, but I noticed it was best applied in a pressing motion than a sweeping one, otherwise the color did not adhere as well. On me, it lasted for nine hours before fading slightly.",B+
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,O YEAH,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, plummy brown with subtle, warm undertones and a pearl sheen. It was intensely pigmented with a smooth, almost cream-like texture as it was dense but not stiff, and it didn’t have any powderiness in the pan. The eyeshadow applied well to bare skin and blended out with ease. It wore well for nine hours before I noticed some signs of fading.",A
BAD HABIT,SUPERNOVA,Palette,"a mix of mattes and shimmers across pink/red-toned shades–from plum to copper to magenta–with taupe and brown grounding shades and a pop of rich, violet purple. Most of the shades were pigmented, blendable, and easy to use with wear time between seven and eight hours. There were a few shades that needed to be built up or used with a dampened brush to make them perform well.",B+
TOO FACED,THAT GIRL,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark plum with strong, warm undertones and gold and plum sparkle and finer pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly to my lips, though I noticed it didn’t adhere as well toward the center of my lower lip. The consistency had moderate slip, was lightly creamy, and comfortable to apply and to wear, despite the amount of shimmer/sparkle in it. It wore well for five hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.
",B+
TOO FACED,HOT FLASH,Lipstick,"a reddish-burgundy with cool undertones and fine, ruby red and fuchsia pearl. It had rich color payoff in a single layer that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips. The texture was lightweight, smooth, and creamy with some slip but not enough to feather or feel slippery while worn. It lasted well for six hours, left a faint stain behind, and was hydrating over time.",A+
TOO FACED,TF 20,Lipstick,"a deep, raspberry pink with cool, blue undertones and pink and red sparkle and pearl. It had intense color coverage in a single layer. The texture was lightweight, smooth, and creamy without being too thick or too thin, so it applied without dragging on my lips but adhered evenly and stayed in place for over six hours. It left a stain behind and was moisturizing while worn.",A+
WET 'N' WILD,AIR,Highlighter,"a pale pink with strong, warm undertones and a sparkling sheen. It had medium coverage, which was buildable to mostly opaque coverage with two to three layers. The powder was soft, more loosely pressed to the point where it seemed a little drier/dustier in the pan, but I didn’t notice any of that in practice as I tapped on the highlighter on my cheek bones. It applied evenly and diffused beautifully along the edges, and as I blended the powder onto my skin, it looked “melted” and yielded a smooth sheen that did not accentuate my skin’s texture. It wore well for eight hours before it started to fade on me.",B+
SEPHORA,ALOHA,Eyeliner,"a deep red with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The texture was smooth, creamy, and had moderate slip and felt a touch wet initially, but it dried down fast enough that it didn’t feather or get into my fine lines. It wore well for 10 and a half hours on me before it started to thin noticeably.",A-
SEPHORA,COCONUT,Eyeliner,"a soft peach with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had opaque pigmentation in one stroke, which was creamy and smooth without being too thin or too thick. The eyeliner skated across my waterline and lower lash line with ease. It lasted for almost eight hours on my water line and closer to 11 hours on my lower lash line.",A
SEPHORA,LAVENDER FIELDS,Eyeliner,"a soft, medium bluish-gray with silver sparkle. The texture was waxy enough that it didn’t drag, but it had chunkier sparkler and a sheerer base, which made the texture of the sparkle more noticeable when I applied it to my lower lash line. It had sheer coverage, and it did not build up well, due to the waxiness. The eyeliner stayed on well for nine hours well with minimal migration from the sparkles.",D-
SEPHORA,MALIBU,Eyeliner,"a medium, reddish plum with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in one layer, which was buildable to opaque coverage with a second layer. The texture was smooth, thin without being too waxy, and glided across my skin without tugging. It wore well for 10 and a half hours on me before I noticed that it looked a bit thinner.",A-
MILANI,SOFT AND SULTRY,Palette,"a mix of neutrals, taupes, and deep gray/black hues. It has “smoky eye” written all over it. For someone who regularly uses eyeshadow primer and prefers to build up some of their mid-tone shades, I think it would work just fine, but my experience was that several of the matte shades were a little too powdery to remain pigmented in practice, had some fallout, and overall, the formula used in the palette was shorter-wearing than average. Used over primer, they lasted longer (12 hours), but they did show fading/creasing sooner than better formulas, even over primer.",B
TOO FACED,BIONIC,Lipstick,"a medium-dark green with cooler teal sparkle and pearl. It looks better from afar as the high-shine finish from all of the shimmer and sparkle camouflages a good amount of the patchiness, but the lipstick did apply terribly–patchy, uneven, and sank into lip lines, likely a result of the rather emollient consistency. It had semi-sheer coverage that did not build up to full coverage when I tried. The color stayed on well for four hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",D+
TOO FACED,MISS THING,Lipstick,"a light-medium, peachy gold with warm, orange undertones and mulit-colored pearl and glitter. It had semi-sheer coverage, which did not build up beyond medium coverage. The texture was very glittery and seemed to have more glitter than base color. Despite the patchier application, it looked quite pretty from far as it was metallic, sparkling, and reflective. I could see it working better over lip liner or a matte lipstick for adding sparkle, though it had enough sparkle to distract from the application woes that I’ll reach for it again. It lasted for three hours and was moisturizing.",D+
TOO FACED,HOOCHIE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium brown with neutral-to-warm undertones and finer, multi-color pearl and micro-sparkle. It wasn’t nearly as metallic nor as shiny compared to the other shades in the range, though it had better pigmentation and applied more smoothly. The consistency was lightweight, smooth, and creamy enough to glide across my lips without tugging but stayed in place well. It wore well for four hours and was moisturizing while worn.",A-
WET 'N' WILD,EARTH,Highlighter,"a pale gold with warm, yellow undertones and a luminous sheen. It had rich color coverage with a soft, lightly dusty texture that felt more loosely pressed but didn’t look dusty or dry on my skin. The highlighter applied evenly and almost appeared blended without having to do anything as the powder seemed to melt on my skin. It produced a noticeable glow that sat well on my skin and did not emphasize my skin’s natural texture. It wore well for eight hours on me before I noticed signs of fading.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,THE BIG O,Eyeshadow,"a soft, peachy-brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. The texture was a smidgen dusty with this shade, though it had good pigmentation and adhered well to bare skin without sheering out too readily. I didn’t have any trouble blending out the edges, and it didn’t seem to turn the other, deeper matte shades grayish when I blended it into them. It lasted well for eight and a half hours on me.",B+
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,DADDI-O,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium brown with warm, yellowish undertones and a matte finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, while the consistency was smooth and velvety without being powdery–substantial enough that I had no trouble applying it to bare skin. It blended out with ease and stayed on well for nine and a half hours on me before fading slightly.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,O MERCY,Eyeshadow,"a muted, deep red with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had a smooth, silky texture that was more firmly-pressed in the pan, so there wasn’t any powderiness, but it wasn’t stiff to work with. I was able to pick up product well with a brush, and it yielded nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer. The eyeshadow blended out easily and stayed on well for nine hours.",B+
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,DYNAM-O,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, bluish-gray with cool undertones and faint sparkle over a matte finish. It had good pigmentation, which was buildable to opaque coverage with two layers. The texture felt smooth to the touch without being powdery, but it didn’t adhere to my lid as evenly as I expected as it seemed particularly prone to grabbing onto any natural oils on my skin, so it was a bit harder to blend out the edges and really get even coverage without a primer. On its own, it lasted for eight and a half hours on me.",C+
MILANI,PURE PASSION,Palette,"a warm-toned neutral palette that leans plum/copper with a mix of shimmers and mattes. The shimmers performed quite well–nicely pigmented, blendable, and easy to use–while the mattes were blendable, some were powdery and sheered out or needed a primer underneath to work well. I did find that most shades wore a bit shorter than average on their own, and even over primer, they showed noticeable fading/creasing after 12-14 hours of wear (I don’t normally see significantly signs of wear with primer).
",B+
TOO FACED,TRAMPULA,Lipstick,"a medium-dark bluish-purple with cool undertones and multi-colored pearl and larger sparkle and glitter. This was one of the worst shades in the line-up as it only had semi-sheer coverage, applied patchily, and the product gathered in my lip lines. It would work better over a lip liner or a deep lipstick as a layering product. The lipstick texture had a lot of slip and felt thinner, almost a bit oily, though it didn’t drag or tug when applied. It lasted for four and a half hours and left a faint, pink stain behind. The formula was lightly hydrating over time.",F
TOO FACED,TOO TOO HOT,Lipstick,"a deep red with subtle, cool undertones and multi-colored pearl (mostly ruby) and slightly larger, fuchsia sparkle. It had a more metallic sheen than overtly glittery finish, which made it even smoother and creamier with opaque color coverage in a single layer. The texture was lightweight, emollient without being too slippery, and comfortable to wear over the five and a half hours it stayed on for. The color left a slight stain behind and was moisturizing while worn.",A
WET 'N' WILD,WATER,Highlighter,"a pale, sky blue with subtle, cool undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. It had good color coverage that was buildable to full coverage with half of a layer on top of the first. The texture was soft, more loosely pressed and somewhat dusty in the pan with slightly chunky sparkle/shimmer within it. This one was a bit harder to blend out and diffuse the edges of on my skin; it applied less evenly initially and took some doing to get a decent spread of coverage across my cheek bones. The finish was beautiful, though, as it was reflective and luminous without emphasizing my skin’s natural texture. On me, the highlighter wore well for seven and a half hours before it started to wear away.",B
BAD HABIT,MYSTICS,Palette,"10 eyeshadows with six shades designed to be wet or dry with a brush and four shades designed to be used with fingertips. The latter four weren’t described to be used wet/dry, but it is the type of formula I’d expect to use either way, so for reference, I swatched those dry/wet. I don’t recommend using the matte shades wet as it seemed to make them harder to use–more prone to patchiness and difficult to blend out.

The matte eyeshadows were extremely powdery and felt thin, which made them have a ton of fallout when applied, have poor adhesion to the lid, and skip when blended as the color adhered unevenly and often disappeared when I tried to blend the color out. They had poor wear and lasted six to seven hours at best.

The Baked Powder shades were the easier shades to work with in the palette, but they had a drier, more loosely-pressed texture that made them more prone to fallout both during application and later on during wear, but they were pigmented, adhered evenly overall, and stayed on for seven to eight hours before creasing. The more shimmery Pressed Powders were dry, almost gritty in texture, which resulted in uneven application applied dry and they had to be used with a dampened brush just to be workable. These were harder to blend out and had some fallout as they dried down. They wore for six to seven hours on me.

I would say that the quality of the Bad Habit palette in general was disappointing — not worth the upcharge (worst palette I’ve tried from them) for their “Luxe” formula, which were some of the worst eyeshadows I’ve worked with this year.",C-
MAKEUP GEEK,APPLE PIE,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, coppery brown with warm, red undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation that was buildable to opaque coverage in one and a half layers. The texture was soft, slightly dusty but applied evenly and blended out nicely on the lid. It wore well for seven and a half hours on its own.
",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,AUTUMN BREEZE,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark teal with cool undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage with two layers. The consistency had a lot more slip than is typical for the brand, so it made the base more prone to applying unevenly if it wasn’t applied with fingertips. I also noticed that the finish seemed to fade from metallic to pearl within a few minutes of application. It lasted for seven and a half hours on me.

This shade will be available August 23rd.",B
MAKEUP GEEK,GRUNGE,Eyeshadow,"a dark, taupe-brown with neutral-to-warm undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was dusty and a little thin, but it had opaque pigmentation that applied well and blended out without too much work, though it was a bit patchy initially. It stayed on well for seven and a half hours before fading noticeably.

This shade will be available August 23rd.",B
MAKEUP GEEK,HAYRIDE,Eyeshadow,"a light brown with warm, yellow undertones and a matte finish. The texture was slightly powdery in the pan, but it managed to yield semi-opaque, buildable coverage. It worked best as a blending/transition shade or brow bone color than an all-over the lid shade, though, as it tended to sheer out a bit in practice. The color wore well for seven hours on me before it faded to my eye.

This shade will be available August 23rd.",B
PAT MCGRATH,GUINEVERE,Lipstick,"a deep red with warm undertones and a satin finish. The color coverage was opaque in one layer (if it was possible to apply half of a layer, that might be all one really needed!), and the color applied evenly and smoothly without settling in my lip lines. It had a smooth, velvety consistency that was creamy without being slippery or “wet.” This particular shade seemed to camouflage my natural texture as well. On me, the lipstick stayed on well for seven hours, left a faint stain behind, and was hydrating while worn.
",A+
PAT MCGRATH,DEEP ORCHID,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark berry with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque, as it didn’t seem to apply quite as well along the inner area of my lips (was slightly under full coverage whereas other areas seemed fully covered). The consistency felt lightweight despite having a thicker feel to it, and the lipstick was creamy enough to glide on without tugging but not so much that it felt slippery while worn. It was comfortable to wear over the seven hours it lasted for, and it felt lightly moisturizing while I wore it.",A
TOO FACED,MARCIA MARCIA MARCIA,Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium fuchsia pink with cool, bluish undertones and iridescent sparkle and shimmer. It seemed like a mix of pink, teal, and fuchsia sparkly bits that caught the light and reflected it back with a high-shine finish and lots of sparkle. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and didn’t emphasize my lip lines. The consistency was smooth, creamy without being heavy and had moderate slip, which made it comfortable to wear, though it didn’t seem too slippery (but definitely didn’t grip as much as the average lipstick). It wore well for five hours and left a faint stain behind and was hydrating over time.",A-
TOO FACED,PIXIE STICK,Lipstick,"a rich purple with warm, pink undertones and purple, violet, and bluish sparkle and glitter. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly, but there was a bit of product that sunk into my lip lines. I did not find it noticeable in person due to the shinier finish and how much the sparkles/glitters caught the light. It had a smooth, lightweight consistency with moderate slip, which helped it spread easily across my lips and feel comfortable to wear. This shade stayed on well for five hours, left a soft pinkish stain behind, and was moisturizing while worn.",B+
NATASHA DENONA,CAMEL,Palette,"a new, neutral palette that features three matte finishes and two shimmery shades. It’s a warmer-toned palette, though it had more muted, yellow undertones across the mattes that made it less typical. Frankly, the tones seemed exactly like what I’d expect to see from palette called “camel!” The five shades worked well together, and I felt like it was easy to get a very diffused and blended crease/transition area with the gradient of mattes. The two shimmers are quite different, so they can create their own gradient by blending the two together. The only “downside” to the palette was that Dune was described as sheer and wasn’t, so that was why the rating dropped.",A-
WET 'N' WILD,FIRE,Highlighter,"a light-medium copper with warm, orange undertones and a luminous sheen. The consistency was soft, drier to the touch with some dustiness in the pan, but it applied beautifully to bare skin with even application, good adherence, and diffused with ease along the edges for a seamless glow. The effect was particularly “lit-from-within” (as the brand promised) as the powder seemed to “melt” on my skin. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.",A
FENTY BEAUTY,DIAMOND BALL-OUT,Highlighter,"a brilliant, medium-dark silver with a sparkling, metallic sheen. Applied more as an eyeshadow, it took on a mid-tone depth, as opposed to when it was sheered out, it looked lighter and brighter–but it was still noticeably silver. The consistency was smooth, dense without being overly firm nor was it too thick, so it was easy to pick up just a smidgen of product on a fluffy, highlighting brush to apply a hint of product on cheekbones as a highlighter but could just as easily be applied with an eyeshadow brush for full color coverage on the lid. It was an incredibly reflective, high-shine highlighter on cheeks, and it blended out well on my skin. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before it started to fade.

This is the brand’s first charity product; 100% of every purchase of this highlighter goes to the Clara Lionel Foundation, which is Rihanna’s non-profit that “funds education, health, and emergency response programs around the world.” I like that the brand has made the Killawatt formula friendly for cheeks and eyes, so for those who want to support the cause, it’s still conventionally “wearable” as a silver eyeshadow, but I tried to showcase it as more “wearable” as a highlighter–it’s all about what you pair it with, I think, and I recommend using a light hand and building up to the intensity and coverage level desired. I was surprised that it paired well with bronzer!",A
DOSE OF COLORS ,NUDE CHICA,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, muted pink with warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, while the liquid lipstick had a smooth, fluid, and thin texture that wasn’t watery, so it spread well across my lips but didn’t feel heavy or take too long to dry down. The color stayed on well for five and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating on me.
",A
DOSE OF COLORS ,PEACHII,Lipstick,"a medium-dark peach with warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. The color coverage was opaque in a single application and went on evenly. It had a lightweight, smooth texture that was thin but not watery, though it seemed to sit in my lip lines a bit more as it was drying down compared to other shades, so it looked a bit “cracked” when I smiled. It wore well for five hours and was non-drying.",A-
DIOR,BRONZE GLOW (004),Highlighter,"a medium peach with warm undertones and a golden sheen. (Or, if you prefer, a very light copper with a reddish undertone.) It had rich color coverage paired with a smooth, moderately dense texture that wasn’t too firmly pressed in the pan that it was stiff to work with or hard to pick up product with a brush. Instead, it wasn’t powdery but sat really well on my skin and yielded a luminous finish that was glowing but not emphasizing of my skin’s natural texture. The highlighter wore well for eight hours before fading slightly.",A
BAD HABIT,ARTISTRY,Palette,"a mix of soft and warm-toned neutrals with a few deeper, earth-toned/neutral-hued shades as well. There was a mix of mattes and shimmers with the shimmers being more frosted/less metallic. I was impressed by the overall quality of the shades and formulas, as they performed on par with most powder eyeshadow formulas. The formula used in this particular palette was soft, a little dusty, but they applied evenly, blended out well, and had good pigmentation for the most part. They lasted between seven and eight hours on their own and looked good after 12-hour wear over a primer.",A-
PAT MCGRATH,EXECUTIVE REALNESS,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark plum with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. The color coverage was fantastic–full coverage in a single layer–that applied evenly and smoothly without tugging or dragging on my lips. It had a velvety, lightly creamy texture that was thicker but not heavy or difficult to work with, and the color seemed to smooth out most of my lip lines. This shade lasted for over seven hours on me, left a moderate pinkish stain behind, and was lightly hydrating.",A+
PAT MCGRATH,EXTRAVAGANZA,Lipstick,"a deep magenta with cool, blue undertones and a cream finish. It had more shine than most of the MatteTrance shades, though it naturally wore down to a more matte finish within two hours of wear. The texture was lightweight, creamy, and smooth with a touch more slip compared to other shades in the same formula. It had opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and did not streak, but there was a bit of product that sat in my deeper lip lines, though it wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance. It wore well for over seven hours, left a fuchsia stain behind, and was moisturizing while worn.",A
LAURA MERCIER ,PEACH,Blush,"a medium pink-coral with golden shimmer and a pearl finish. It had semi-sheer, buildable pigmentation (up to opaque coverage with three layers) that applied fairly evenly and blended out without too much effort. The consistency was smooth to the touch but firmer and thinner, which made it less ideal to work with, as it had a tendency to absorb natural oils on my skin (making it harder to blend out/appear patchy). It lasted for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.",B
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,GLITZ ALRIGHT,Eyeliner,"a muted, medium plum with warmer, brownish undertones and a glittery finish. It had semi-sheer coverage, which was buildable to semi-opaque coverage with two to three layers (or, preferrably, applied in short, overlapping strokes). The texture was still smooth and creamy, but it just didn’t have the intensity and oomph of other shades. The wear was good, though, and came in at a solid 11 hours before it started to thin slightly.",B-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,GLAM JAM,Eyeliner,"a deep red with subtle, warm undertones and flecks of silver sparkle and fine pearl. It had opaque pigmentation with a creamy, smooth consistency that was easy to apply as it glided across my lash line without tugging. The color distributed evenly as I went–no need to layer–and didn’t feather or move around while it set. It lasted well for 12 hours with minimal fading, thinning, and I didn’t notice any fallout/migration.",A+
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,GLITTERBUG,Eyeliner,"a deep brown with neutral-to-warm undertones and a fine sparkle. It did not seem to be particularly sparkly–wouldn’t have classified it as a Glam Glitter finish as compared to a shimmer finish, really–but it was richly pigmented and had a very creamy, almost slippery, texture that was easy to glide across my lash line for opaque, even color application in a single stroke. It wore beautifully for over 12 hours without fading or thinning on me.",A+
MAKEUP GEEK,BLUE MY MIND,Eyeshadow,"a rich, medium blue with cool undertones and a metallic sheen. The consistency was incredibly dense, slightly thick, and cream-like–a denser texture than most of their Foiled shades. It had opaque color coverage, and surprisingly, it applied well with a brush as well as fingertips, and it wasn’t a challenge to blend. It wore well for eight hours on me before creasing faintly.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,LEAFING SO SOON,Eyeshadow,"a light green with warm, golden shimmer and a frosted finish. It had sheer coverage with a drier, dustier texture that was hard to work with. I could only salvage this shade by applying it with a dampened brush and using four to five layers, and it always seemed to look a bit faded/less shimmery within a few minutes of application. After the initial application, it started to be more noticeably faded at the seven-hour mark.",F
MAKEUP GEEK,PINK OF ME,Eyeshadow,"a medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a frosted finish. It had good color coverage that was buildable to opaque coverage with two layers. The texture was drier and dusty in the pan with slight fallout during application. The eyeshadow stayed on well for seven and a half hours on me.",B
MAKEUP GEEK,SUMMER LOVIN,Eyeshadow,"a medium orange with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation with a soft consistency that just a touch dusty in the pan, but it blended out well and did not sheer out too readily. This shade wore well for seven and a half hours on me before I noticed signs of fading.",B+
URBAN DECAY,NOISE,Lipstick,"a deep, fuchsia pink with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had buildable coverage from semi-sheer to full coverage in two to three layers. The texture felt clay-like in the pot–movable but not wet–and applied as a thin, more powder-like layer of product that clung noticeably but didn’t actually feel drying over time. This shade emphasized my lip texture slightly but from afar, it wasn’t noticeable. The color applied evenly and blended easily across my lips. It wore well for six hours, was non-drying, and did not seem to break down with water.",A-
URBAN DECAY,WAVELENGTH,Lipstick,"a medium purple with warm, pink undertones and a matte finish. It had buildable pigmentation that ranged from sheer to semi-opaque. The color applied fairly evenly, but the finish emphasized my lip lines and lip texture, which gave my lips a drier, slightly shriveled appearance. The product felt clay-like in the pot, where it was movable as a whole but did not feel wet or creamy. On my lips, it was more like a thin powder. It lasted for four and a half hours, and it did not seem to break down when I drank water.",B
DIOR,ROSE GLOW (005),Highlighter,"a medium pink with warmer undertones and a metallic sheen. Of the six shades that released, this had the strongest finish–definitely metallic–and while I didn’t feel it emphasized my skin’s natural texture, this would be the one I’d be wary of if you find highlighters are prone to that on your skin. The powder had a soft, smooth consistency that was dense without being stiff to work with, so I had no trouble picking product and getting opaque coverage in one layer, if I wanted, but the denser texture meant I could simply use a lighter touch and build up coverage if that was more desirable. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before fading a touch.",A
TOO FACED,THEN AND NOW,Palette,"exactly what I’d expect from the brand to celebrate their 20th anniversary. From the types of colors to the finishes to the color scheme and to the packaging, it’s so on-brand that it really seemed fitting for this particular milestone. I thought the concept was interesting–taking their original 10 eyeshadows and then updating them–but what I’ll say about that is I think I’d rather have seen them update the original shades (better formulations, slight tweaks for a modern interpretation) and then pairing them with 10 shades worked with them. Instead, the palette offers a distorted mirror image of the original 10, and I felt like it made the palette a little less cohesive than it should be for having 22 shades (I was definitely longing for some more satin/matte, deeper shades).

Overall, the quality was better than expected; better than the average for Too Faced and their limited edition palettes compared to the last few years (though I’ve seen some improvement over the last year here). There are several glittery shades, which suffer from your typical glitter eyeshadow problems, like glitter not binding with the base, fallout (during and after application), and so on. If you’re someone who often users fingertips or dampened brushes (or a glitter adhesive), I suspect you’ll be just fine working with this palette. Also, the palette is rather over-sized, so keep that in mind for organization and traveling purposes, but it certainly contains a ton of product for your money.",B
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,ICED,Eyeliner,"a silvery white with cool undertones and a pearl finish with faint silver sparkle on top. It wasn’t very glittery (not “packed” with glitter), though. The texture was lightly creamy, smooth, and comfortable to apply as it didn’t tug or drag on my lash line. This shade stayed on well for 11 hours on me before starting to thin noticeably on me.",A-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,ALL THAT GLITTERS,Eyeliner,"a light-medium gold with subtle, warm yellow undertones and a glittery finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a lot of fine sparkle and glittery bits in it. The base seemed almost translucent, so it was harder to build up coverage to my eye, though it was noticeable on my lash line. The texture was smooth, creamy, and comfortable to apply in a single stroke across my skin. The glitter dispersed well as I drew the line, which was nice to see. It lasted well for 12 hours with minimal movement, fading, and glitter migration.",A-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,GLITZ BLITZ,Eyeliner,"a medium-dark copper with warm, rosy undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-sheer coverage with a smooth, lightly creamy texture that glided across nicely along my lash line without tugging. It was buildable to mostly opaque coverage with two to three layers. The eyeliner stayed on nicely for 11 hours before starting thin slightly.",B-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,GEMSTONED,Eyeliner,"a deep, blue-leaning teal with flecks of multi-colored pearl and larger gold and blue glitter. It was intensely pigmented with a smooth, creamy texture that skated across my skin with ease and delivered rich, even coverage that stayed on all day long. It had minimal fading after 12 hours of wear, even on my waterline, with no discernible fallout.
",A+
PAT MCGRATH,ELSON 2,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark orange-red with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, which applied evenly and smoothly across my lips without tugging. The lipstick had a lightweight, velvety consistency that was comfortable to wear but adhered well, too. There was a smidgen of product in my deeper lip lines from the initial application, though it wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance, and it seemed to smooth out as it wore down to a matte finish (within an hour). It stayed on well for seven hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.",A
PAT MCGRATH,FORBIDDEN LOVE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark red with cooler undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a lightweight, creamy consistency that felt velvety and dense without being firm, so it applied without tugging on my lips but did not slide around while worn. I noticed that this particular shade had a bit more slip compared to most shades in the MatteTrance line, though. The lipstick stayed on well for eight hours and left a strong stain behind, while the formula was lightly hydrating over time.",A
DIOR,PINK GLOW (002),Highlighter,"a very light pink with warmer undertones and a metallic sheen. This shade had a slightly stronger sheen compared to others in the formula, though most can be used more sheerly for a less luminous finish or built up for greater shine. This highlighter was intensely pigmented with a smooth, blendable consistency that was firmly pressed in the pan, so there wasn’t any powderiness, but it yielded well to my brushes for good product pick up . The powder applied evenly to bare skin and blended out with almost no effort at all and didn’t seem to accentuate my skin’s natural texture. The color lasted well for eight and a half hours on me before it started to fade a bit.",A
DOSE OF COLORS ,AESTHETIC,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark copper with warm, red undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was smooth, fluid without being runny, and spread easily across my lips for even application that didn’t gather in my lip lines and dried down quickly (but gave me enough time to maneuver along the edges of my lips). It was intensely pigmented and stayed on well for over six hours. The formula felt neither drying nor hydrating on me.",A
DOSE OF COLORS ,FRESA,Lipstick,"a bright, coral-red with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, while the texture was smooth, fluid, and a little thin–almost streaky when I initially applied it, but it seemed to self-level and smooth out when drying down. This shade lasted well for over six hours on me, left a stain behind, and was a touch drying toward the end of wear.",A
DOMINIQUE COSMETICS,LEMONADE,Palette,"a fun, summer palette that features six shimmery shades and four matte shades. The mattes were particularly impressive, while the shimmers were good with one being a slight miss for me (but workable). The majority of the eyeshadows had good pigmentation, were blendable, and lasted for eight hours.

Worth mentioning, this palette was originally released a couple of months ago, but there were numerous complaints with respect to a couple of the shimmers being very stiff/too firmly pressed, and the brand responded (quite quickly, actually) by going back and tweaking the press of the shimmer shades and then sending out replacement palettes to everyone who had ordered this palette (without requiring anyone to send their original palettes back). The shimmers in the replacement version were definitely softer and more yielding than the original palette. I was impressed by that level of customer service, though, and it was communicated very well throughout, from the initial information to follow-ups on ETAs and shipping notifications.",A-
URBAN DECAY,FREQUENCY,Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium-dark coral-red with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had buildable coverage from medium to full in three layers. The texture felt dense, clay-like (movable but not wet), and applied as a very lightweight, powder-like product on my lips. The color distributed evenly across my lips and didn’t seem to sit in my lip lines or emphasize my natural texture. This shade lasted well for six hours and didn’t seem to break down with water.",A
URBAN DECAY,HALO,Lipstick,"a light pink with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had sheer coverage that built up to medium with three to four layers. The texture was clay-like, where I could push it around, but it had a drier, more velvety feel to the touch. The lipstick applied as a thin, lightweight layer but this shade emphasized every bit of texture I had on my lips, and I could not get the color to apply evenly or build up to full coverage. It lasted for three hours and was non-drying, though it felt clingy while worn.
",D
LAURA MERCIER ,CHAI,Blush,"a medium, rosy mauve with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had sheer, buildable coverage–up to semi-opaque with three layers–with a thin, stiffer texture that was harder to pick up evenly with a brush and more challenging to apply and diffuse on my skin as the color didn’t spread or diffuse well. I found that it darkened noticeably after application, which can be an issue with thinner, matte powders. This shade stayed on well for eight hours on me before I noticed fading.",C+
URBAN DECAY,TONGUE TIED,Lipgloss,"a deep fuchsia pink with cool undertones and lighter pink and fuchsia sparkle. It had medium coverage that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips without settling into my lip lines. The gloss had a smooth, gel-like texture that wasn’t sticky and thin enough to feel lightweight but still comfortable. It stayed on well for four hours and was lightly moisturizing.",A
URBAN DECAY,APHRODISIAC,Lipgloss,"a medium brown with strong, warm orange undertones and sparkle that shifted from pink to teal. It tinted my natural lip color to appear warmer, peachier, and it delivered a moderate amount of shimmer/sparkle. It was an easy-to-wear gloss that didn’t pull into lip lines and made my lips appear smoother and plusher. It was described as “sheer,” so the coverage was as anticipated. The consistency was lightweight, smooth, and almost creamy initially with little tackiness. It wore well for three and a half hours and was hydrating while worn.",A
URBAN DECAY,GHOSTED,Lipgloss,"a nearly translucent base with multi-colored glitter. (The brand described it as a “sheer lavender,” and my eye can just barely see a purplish cast to the gloss when swatched.) The base brought out the pink tones in my natural lip slightly, but I don’t expect it to alter the natural lip color much since it was so sheer. There was noticeable sparkle, but it was sparser on my lips than it appeared in the tube. The texture was lightweight, smooth, and gel-like, which made it sit well on my lips but prone to wearing down within two and a half hours. I did feel the glitter in it after an hour of wear. The formula was lightly moisturizing over time.",B+
PAT MCGRATH,FLESH 5,Lipstick,"a deep, reddened plum with warm undertones and a satin finish. It was intensely pigmented with smooth, opaque color coverage in a single layer. It applied evenly and never tugged or dragged on my lips. The texture was smooth, velvety, and thick without being heavy and didn’t emphasize my lip lines. This shade stayed on well for seven hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A+
PAT MCGRATH,FEVER DREAM,Lipstick,"a medium-dark coral-red with warm undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, while the texture was smooth, velvety and creamy enough to glide on easily without feeling slippery while worn. The lip color wore down to a more matte finish within an hour of wear, and it seemed to smooth out the color, too, as there was a smidgen of product in my deeper lip lines after the initial application (though it wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance). It wore well for six and a half hours and was moisturizing while worn.",A
DIOR,NUDE GLOW (001),Highlighter,"a soft, light peach with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It was richly pigmented with a soft, smooth texture that was dense and more firmly-pressed, which ensured there was no dustiness, but it seemed a little more yielding to a brush compared to the other shades, so this was very easy to apply and blend out on my skin. The highlighter applied evenly to bare skin, didn’t emphasize my skin’s natural texture, and lasted for a solid eight and a half hours on me.",A
URBAN DECAY,APHRODISIAC,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette that features three mattes and three shimmers. Though, at a glance, it looked like it would work well together, but in practice, I struggled to apply the colors cohesively without the colors muddying together. It could have been, in part, due to the overall quality of the shades, which wasn’t impressive. The palette launches exclusively on Ulta today.",B-
PAT MCGRATH,CHRISTY,Lipstick,"a medium pink with strong, warm undertones and a cream finish. (It took two hours or so for the finish to look more matte.) It was intensely pigmented with a smooth, velvety texture that had slight slip but was dense and more substantial without feeling heavy on my lips. The lipstick applied evenly across my lips and never tugged on them. The color stayed on well for five hours and was moisturizing while worn.",A
PAT MCGRATH,BEAUTIFUL STRANGER,Lipstick,"a muted, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had opaque pigmentation with a smooth, velvety texture that was a little thicker than the average lipstick but it didn’t feel slippery or slide around on my lips after I applied it. The color went on evenly, but there was a bit of product that sank into my lip lines, though it didn’t worsen (it seemed to smooth out within three hours of wear as the slip wore away). This shade lasted well for six hours and was hydrating over time.",A
DOSE OF COLORS ,SOL MATE,Highlighter,"a medium-dark gold with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. The consistency was soft, smooth, and blendable with intense color coverage in a single layer. It was denser and more cream-like to the touch but picked up easily with a tapered highlighting brush–I was able to use a lighter hand for more medium coverage, too. The highlighter applied evenly to bare skin, blended out with ease, and sat well without emphasizing my skin’s natural texture. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me.

P.S. — Mine arrived broken but Dose of Colors will replace it.",A
DOSE OF COLORS ,BARELY THERE,Lipgloss,"a soft, light-medium peach with warm undertones and a cream finish with barely-there, fine gold pearl. The consistency was lightweight, comfortable to apply and to wear, as it was smooth without being thick or tacky. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly along the edges of my lips, but there was a faint amount of streaking and noticeable color in my lip lines–the latter not a big surprise given the lighter, creamier color choice. It lasted for three hours and was lightly hydrating.
",B-
DOSE OF COLORS ,BILLO,Lipgloss,"a sheer, slightly beige-tinted base with a moderate amount of gold micro-glitter. It had a good level of shine and the glitter dispersed well across my lips. There was something to the base, though, as I could see a smidgen of product in my deeper lip lines (looked almost like a milky beige). The texture was lightweight, non-sticky, and smooth overall, but I could feel some of the glitter when I pressed my lips together. It wore well for three hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",B+
URBAN DECAY,ECHO,Lipstick,"a medium-dark plum with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had buildable coverage from sheer to opaque in three layers. The texture felt clay-like in the pot, movable but not wet or creamy (like you might expect a potted lipstick to feel). It was thinner and felt like powder when patted onto my lips, and it felt a little clingy to me (which I didn’t enjoy, but it wasn’t actually drying) and did emphasize my lip texture a bit. It wore well for five hours and definitely survived drinking water.",B+
URBAN DECAY,FADE,Lipstick,"a medium, rosy brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. The pigmentation was buildable from sheer to mostly opaque coverage in three layers. The lipstick had a velvety, dense, and clay-like texture in the pot, which translated to a thin, more powder-like, very lightweight feeling on my lips. I found it felt a bit clingy, though it didn’t dry out my lips over time. The color applied evenly and blended out well, but the finish emphasied my lip lines a bit. It stayed on well for four and a half hours but water didn’t seem to break it down.",B+
CHANTECAILLE ,SUNLIGHT,Highlighter,"a soft orange with a sparkling, golden sheen. It had medium coverage, which was buildable to semi-opaque coverage, with fine shimmer that managed to sparkle and reflect light well but did not read glittery on my skin. The texture was drier to the touch and didn’t feel as “luxe” to the touch as I would expect at this price point, but it looked fantastic applied and blended out with ease in practice. It’s more like a highlighting bronzer (for some skin tones) than strictly a highlighter. The brand doesn’t offer much insight into coverage, only with respect to the finish (“beachy glow”). It wore well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.

P.S. — Please note the compact size/product size, as it is smaller than most highlighting products on the market.",B+
DOSE OF COLORS ,ILUVSARAHII,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette that includes six eyeshadows–three shimmers and three mattes (well, one is mostly matte!). It gave me beachy, summer vibes, and the six shades worked well together, and I could see at least a handful of other ideas from the shades. The shimmers and mattes blended well over and with each other, which isn’t always the case with more frosted, metallic shimmers like the ones in this palette.",A-
COLOUR POP,LUMIERE,Lipstick,"a medium mauve with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, lightly creamy texture that was lightly tacky on my lips. The color applied evenly across my lips without tugging. It wore well for five hours with a slight amount of product that pulled into my lip lines over time. The formula was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",A
COLOUR POP,LUMIERE 2,Lipstick,"a muted purple with warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. It was intensely pigmented with a fluid, creamy consistency that worked best if I wiped a bit of the product off from the lip of the tube before applying or else it was almost “too pigmented.” The liquid lipstick dried down within 30 seconds to a mostly matte finish which appeared “cracked” a bit when I smiled. The color stayed on well for over six hours but was slightly drying over time.",B+
ANASTASIA,ROSE GOLD,Highlighter,"a rich, reddish-copper with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It was intensely pigmented with a smooth, spreadable, and gel-like texture that was easy to apply to bare skin and diffuse with fingertips or brushes. Over complexion products, it blended out best with a brush, which didn’t lift up my base, but fingertips seemed to be more prone to slight lifting (and normally, fingertips are my preferred tool for liquid highlighters). It had a stronger, more metallic sheen that didn’t smooth out my skin texture but did not accentuate it either (right on the line–if you have more texture, you may find it emphasizing!). It wore well for eight hour son me before fading slightly.",A-
CHANEL,QUINTESSENCE (440),Blush,"a medium pink with warmer undertones and a mostly matte finish. There was faint pearl I could see more in the pan than I could see in the swatch, and I didn’t notice any of it on my cheeks! It had medium, buildable pigmentation–and the brand markets their blushes as buildable–with a very finely-milled powder that was slightly powdery in the pan. It applied evenly and diffused well without having to work at it. The finish was definitely matte on my skin, and it did not seem to darken over time (which is an issue with some matte powders). On me, it wore well for eight hours before fading noticeably.",A-
DOSE OF COLORS ,BATHE,Highlighter,"a medium, rosy copper with warm undertones and a high-shine, metallic finish. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, creamy texture that was dense but not difficult to pick up product with using a brush. The powder applied evenly to my cheek bones and diffused easily without losing intensity. The finish was very shiny and reflective but did not seem to accentuate my skin’s natural texture. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me.",A+
NARS,WANTED,Palette,"a new, Ulta-exclusive six-shade set of lip glosses in shades of pink and brown. They have an autumnal vibe to me without being vampy, which I’d say makes them more “wearable” for more people. There are some repeats here, so anyone who’s picked up the singles or sets in the past may want to check their stash for duplicates. The quality was good, but a couple of shades weren’t quite as good as this formula can get.",B+
DIOR,HOLOGRAPHIC GLOW (006),Highlighter,"an iridescent blue-to-violet sheen with very finely-milled pearl that gave a noticeable shine on my skin and subtle, cooler tint. I find this type of highlighter works particularly well paired blushes in shades of pink, berry, and plum (though play around, it can create quite the transformative shift!). The consistency was dense, a bit firm to the touch, but very smooth and finely-milled. It was easiest to apply it using a moderate hand and a standard, tapered highlighting brush and build it up from medium coverage to semi-opaque pigmentation. This shade stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me before fading noticeably.",B+
NATASHA DENONA,LILA,Palette,"a fun color story, and for as edited as it is, actually came together cohesively for me. I would have liked to have seen the shimmery purple be a little creamier/thinner so it would layer better with the mattes more readily. The medium, warmer plum hue could have been more blendable over bare skin.",B+
HOURGLASS,AURA,Eyeshadow,"a medium copper with warm, rosy undertones and a sparkling sheen. It had sheer coverage applied in a single layer, and it was buildable to medium coverage in two to three layers. I tried to achieve opaque coverage with this shade and needed four layers and a dampened brush. My guess was that the drier, more flaky texture in the pot resulted in a consistency that was harder to pick up, apply, and blend out. It lasted for seven and a half hours on me with slight fallout over time.",C
HOURGLASS,BLAZE,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark copper with warm, rusty red undertones and a sparkling sheen. It had medium coverage applied in one layer, which was buildable to opaque coverage with a second layer. The texture was smoother, lightly creamy, and thin without being too thin or too slippery on my skin, so it applied evenly and blended out well without losing its intensity. There was a touch of fallout when I blended it out on my lid, and then there was a little more after eight hours of wear.",A-
HOURGLASS,FOIL,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium copper with strong, warm golden undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. It had a stronger reflective quality to it than other shades, partially because it was one of the lighter/brighter hues, too. The texture was fairly smooth, lightly creamy, but it felt more like a powdery than a cream to me (almost like it was a little dried out already). It had medium coverage applied in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with two to three layers. I found this applied best with a dampened brush over fingertips or a dry brush. It wore well for eight hours with slight fallout over time.",B+
HOURGLASS,REFLECT,Eyeshadow,"a soft, rosy copper with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-sheer pigmentation in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with two to three layers. The consistency was smooth, lightly creamy, and thin without being clingy or difficult to apply or blend out along the edges. The color stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me and didn’t seem to have any fallout.",A
HOURGLASS,SMOKE,Eyeshadow,"a medium taupe with warmer undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. The eyeshadow had semi-sheer pigmentation in a single layer, which built up to full coverage with two to three layers. It had a smoother, lightly creamy texture that applied evenly to bare skin and blended out with little effort. On me, it lasted well for eight and a half hours before fading slightly. This shade had a minimal amount of fallout present at the end of wear.",A-
URBAN DECAY,AMPLIFY,Lipstick,"a deep, slightly muted, red with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had buildable coverage from sheer to opaque depending on application and how much one applies. The color applied evenly across my lips and didn‚Äôt accentuate the texture of my lips or gather in my lip lines. The consistency was dense, velvety, and felt like a powder when the product met my lips, which felt ‚Äúdry‚Äù as a result, though the formula didn‚Äôt feel drying over time. It was very lightweight and stayed on well for six hours.",A
URBAN DECAY,BOOM,Lipstick,"a deep berry with subtle, cool undertones and a faint pearl over a more matte finish. It had buildable coverage from sheer to semi-opaque that applied evenly across my lips. The texture was very lightweight, thin, and powder-like once on my lips, though the lip product itself was more like clay in the pan/pot‚Äìmovable but dense. It did accentuate my lip texture, though, and gave my lips a more shriveled appearance. The color stayed on well for five hours, was non-drying, and seemed to be waterproof as it didn‚Äôt come away on my glass or break down by drinking water.",B+
ANASTASIA,PENNY,Highlighter,"a bright, medium, copper with warm, orange undertones and a metallic sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, but the fluid consistency made it possible to apply less for sheerer coverage if preferred., The texture was spreadable on bare skin and over liquid foundation, though I found stippling brushes to be more forgiving when I worked with this shade on top of base products to ensure no lifting of my base while moving and blending the highlighter out. It blended out fairly evenly, but it could have been a bit easire to work with overall. The finish was moderate in shine‚Äìa little dewy but it dried down so there was no tackiness left behind‚Äìand not as overtly metallic as Patina. The color lasted well for seven and a half hours on me.",B
ANASTASIA,LUNA,Lipgloss,"a light-medium gold with subtle, warm undertones and flecks of silver, white gold, and gold pearl and larger sparkle. As expected based on the brand‚Äôs description of the new shade, it had sheer to semi-sheer color coverage with a moderate amount of sparkle paired with a glossy finish. There was a slightly milky quality to the underlying base, but it did not settle as badly in my lips as some of the other shades from the fall shades. The texture was smooth and lightweight, almost creamy, and comfortable to spread over my lips and to wear. This shade wore well for three hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",B
ANASTASIA,SUNSCAPE,Lipgloss,"a soft, medium coral with warm undertones and pink and gold sparkle and finer shimmer. It had medium coverage, which was more than the other four shades in the range and more than described, but I think the higher coverage might have helped this look better on the lips as a standalone gloss. It settled slightly into my lip lines, but the shimmer, sparkle, and shine made it hard to notice it in person from a normal viewing distance. The gloss did not streak along the edges and had a smooth, mostly non-sticky texture. It lasted for three hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.",B-
ANASTASIA,VENUS,Lipgloss,"a soft, yellowed peach base with multi-colored flecks of sparkle and pearl. It had sheer coverage, just as expected based on the brand‚Äôs description, and had a moderate amount of sparkle/shimmer that gave the lips a reflective, shiny finish. The gloss applied evenly, but some of the base color settled into my lip lines, though wasn‚Äôt as noticeable from a normal viewing distance as the shininess helped hide it. The consistency was smooth, lightweight, spreadable, and mostly non-sticky, which made for comfortable wear over the three hours it stayed on well for.",B
COLOURED RAINE,PURP SMURF,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium purple with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It was slightly drier in consistency with a thinner feel, which made it on the dusty side. I found it had a tendency to cling to any dryness/texture on my lid, so I had to really buff and blend it out, and even then, there was slight patchiness. This particular shade would work better over primer and possibly over a translucent powder. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. This shade stayed on well for nine hours but left a faint stain behind, which disappear following my morning shower.",B
COLOURED RAINE,VIBEZ,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark lavender with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. The color coverage was nearly opaque in a single layer, which was definitely buildable to fully opaque coverage with less than half of a layer on top. The texture was slightly dusty in the pan, but the color applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin. I didn‚Äôt have any issues diffusing and blending out this shade. On me, it wore well for eight and a half hours and didn‚Äôt seem to stain.",A-
COLOURED RAINE,BOSSED UP,Eyeshadow,"a rich magenta with cool, blue undertones and a matte finish. There was almost imperceptible micro-shimmer in it (I couldn‚Äôt see it in person, only in the close-up photos I took), which seem to be included to improve blendability in some matte shades. It was richly pigmented with a soft, slightly powdery texture, but it blended out well on my skin and lasted for nine hours. This shade stained very slightly on me, but it came off after my morning cleanse the next day.",A
COLOURED RAINE,CUTE,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium lavender with warm, pink undertones and a matte finish. The texture was soft, somewhat powdery, but it blended out easily and applied evenly to bare skin. The eyeshadow sheered out a bit when I tried to work with it as a lid shade, but it didn‚Äôt turn patchy or darken too noticeably without primer. The color stayed on well for eight hours on me before it started to fade noticeably.",B+
MAC,PINK,Palette,"contains two full-sized lipsticks and one full-sized lipgloss. The two lipsticks were good, while the lipgloss was more cream-based and pulled into some of my lip lines, which may or may not be a deal-breaker for you. The set has a value of $54.50, which makes it worthwhile if you think you‚Äôll enjoy at least two of the shades (but really, preferably all three!).",B+
BITE BEAUTY,LEO,Lipstick,"glittery mix of gold and copper sparkle and micro-glitter. It didn‚Äôt seem like it had much color, but it seemed to turn my lips a coppery-brown shade along with adding a fair amount of sparkle and micro-glitter. As a result, it ended up appearing deeper and more pigmented applied than swatched and in comparison to other sparkling golds Bite‚Äôs released in the past. It had semi-sheer, buildable coverage (to about medium coverage) with a fairly smooth, emollient texture that was thinner and less creamy compared to the standard Amuse Bouche shade. I didn‚Äôt find it gritty during application, and I only started to feel the sparkles in the last hour of wear (but to me it never felt rough/gritty/otherwise bothersome). This shade lasted for four hours and was lightly hydrating.",B
DIOR,GOLDEN GLOW (003),Highlighter,"a medium gold with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It had opaque pigmentation with a smooth, dense consistency that was firm to the touch (no powderiness!) and was best used with a moderately dense highlighting brush (I used a slew of tapered ones with the formula just fine). The highlighter applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin, blended out with ease, and didn‚Äôt emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. It seemed a smidgen lighter than the shade in the previous formula, but on my skin, it was hard to tell. This shade lasted well for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.",A-
COLOUR POP,ASTROLOGY,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium gold with subtle, warm undertones and a highly-reflective, metallic sheen. It‚Äôs like a ‚Äúcooler‚Äù gold, but it doesn‚Äôt lean silver or get into pewter territory, so it still read warm-toned overall. It had rich, opaque pigmentation in a single layer, and a little went a long way, which I preferred to apply using a small, flat synthetic brush as it gave me more control over how much and wear it applied. The eyeshadow blended out nicely without losing its coverage. The texture was smooth, almost like a mousse but rather thin (but not watery!) and dried down fast enough not to settle into my lines but gave me enough time to work with it. On me, it stayed on well for over 10 hours.",A+
COLOUR POP,CONSTELLATION,Eyeshadow,"a medium, rosy copper with subtle, warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good pigmentation in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with less than half of a layer on top. The liquid eyeshadow had a smooth, thin consistency that was a bit more emollient than Astrology but was easy enough to apply, blend out, and wait to dry without it creasing before it finished drying down. The eyeshadow wore well for 10 hours without fading or creasing on me.",A
COLOURED RAINE,SQUAD,Eyeshadow,"a deep green with cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It was richly pigmented and had a soft, blendable texture that was a little drier to the touch, but it applied evenly and was easy to diffuse. It wore well for eight and a half hours before it started to fade.",A
COLOURED RAINE,LEVEL UP,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium green with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good color coverage that was opaque after two layers. The texture was drier and more firmly-pressed in the pan compared to other shades, so it could have blended a bit more readily, though it wasn‚Äôt too troublesome to work with. It stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me.",B
COLOURED RAINE,YACHT LIFE,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark blue with cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. The pigmentation was opaque, while the texture was drier and a bit thinner, which made it harder to work with on my lid as it was harder to diffuse and blend out. On me, it lasted for just over eight hours on me before I noticed fading.",B
COLOURED RAINE,DRIP DROP,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium blue with cool undertones and a mostly matte finish. The consistency was somewhat powdery, so I would recommend tapping away excess and applying prior to any base products. It had good color payoff that sheered out a touch when I applied it to my lid, but it was buildable (and even easier to work with over primer). This shade wore well for eight hours on me before it started to fade.",B+
COLOURED RAINE,NEO BLUE,Eyeshadow,"a bright, cobalt blue with cool undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage with less than half of a layer on top. The texture was slightly dusty and a bit drier than I‚Äôd expect, but I didn‚Äôt have any trouble applying or blending out this shade on my skin. The color stayed on well for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.",A-
COLOURED RAINE,JET SET,Eyeshadow,"is a medium-dark periwinkle with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had medium coverage, which was harder to build up as the color had a tendency to sheer out to the more powdery consistency. I found it most workable when I used it to diffuse some of the deeper purples/blues in the collection, and then it worked nicely, but as a lid shade, it would likely need a white base to perform true-to-pan. This shade lasted nicely for seven hours on me before starting to look a bit patchy.",C+
MAC,NUDE,Palette,"contains two full-sized lipsticks and one full-sized lipgloss. These sets are always a good value ($54.50), so if the colors are up your alley and you‚Äôre in the market for lipstick and gloss, they can be a great option. This particular set is very pink-toned‚Äìmore pink than ‚Äúnude‚Äù‚Äìand as long as it‚Äôs not a deal-breaker that the gloss is milky and settles into line, then the lipsticks are decent.",B
NATASHA DENONA,LIGHT-MEDIUM (02),Highlighter,"a soft peach with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable coverage with an intense, high-shine finish that probably could have been seen from space. The consistency of the powder was soft, smooth, and dense without being stiff or too thick to work with, so the powder applied evenly and blended out with little effort. Sometimes with denser powders, especially ones as metallic and shiny as this one, is that they can read thick and textured on the skin, but this was quite smooth. It didn‚Äôt hide texture, but it didn‚Äôt seem to add it either, which was most apparent in person as it almost smoothed out the appearance of my skin as light bounced off of my cheekbones. This shade stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me.",A-
COLOURED RAINE,SAUCE,Eyeshadow,"a deep red with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with less than half of a layer on top. The texture was slightly grainy, drier to the touch, but I didn‚Äôt have any issues with the actual application (where it matters) as the powder applied evenly and blended out very easily. It wore well for nine hours and stained my skin slightly, though it seemed to wash off the next morning.",A
COLOURED RAINE,PARTY DRIP,Eyeshadow,"a vivid, medium fuchsia pink with strong, cool, blue undertones and a matte finish. It looked more blue-based when applied than it initially appeared in the pan. It had rich color payoff that applied evenly to bare skin and blended out well, though the powder darkened about a shade and a half on my lid, even over primer. The texture was fairly soft, but it was a little on the drier side. This shade lasted for eight and a half hours on me and didn‚Äôt seem to stain my skin.",A
COLOURED RAINE,SPLASH,Eyeshadow,"a rich, medium-dark orange with warm, red undertones and a matte finish. It had opaque color coverage in a single layer, while the consistency was fairly smooth, a touch dry, but it applied evenly to bare skin and blended out well. The color stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me.",A
COLOURED RAINE,UNBOTHERED,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark coral with warm, pink undertones and a mostly matte finish. The color payoff was fantastic, while the texture was soft, smooth, and blendable without being too powdery nor too firmly pressed in the pan. The eyeshadow wore well for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.",A
COLOURED RAINE,CRUSHIN',Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium coral with warm, orange undertones and a matte finish. It had excellent pigmentation with a soft, fairly smooth, but moderately powdery texture. I struggled to get this shade to apply evenly on my skin with full coverage, even when I tried over eyeshadow primer. It was easier and more functional used to diffuse and blend out other shades in my crease rather than as a lid shade. I also noticed it had a tendency to darken a bit on my lid, which seemed to ‚Äúeat‚Äù this shade within seven hours of wear.",B-
COLOURED RAINE,LEMON DROP,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium yellow with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had rich pigmentation with a soft, moderately powdery consistency that had a tendency to sheer out and go on a bit unevenly, especially as the powder darkened a bit after a few minutes on my lid. I noticed it still darkened noticeably when I used it over a primer, too. The eyeshadow stayed on well for seven hours on me before it started to look patchy. Like Crushin‚Äô, it seemed better to use this in the crease and blended out where opacity wasn‚Äôt quite as much of a concern and there were less visible texture/lines (compared to my lid).",B
MAC,ALOOF,Lipstick,"a soft, light pink with medium, warm undertones and a soft sheen. It had medium, buildable pigmentation that applied fairly evenly in a single layer; the sheerer coverage was expected due to the Lustre finish. The texture was lightly creamy with slight slip and light tackiness, so it felt more emollient but did not slide around on my lips. There was a touch of product that sat in my lip lines from the get-go, though it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from afar. This shade lasted for three hours and was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",B-
MAC,CHINTZ,Lipstick,"a deep bronze with subtle, warm red undertones and a metallic sheen. It had medium coverage, which was somewhat buildable, but this shade worked best to add shine and shimmer over one‚Äôs natural lip color or to layer over another shade. The lipstick was lightweight with slight slip but not enough to feel wet or slide around. It was comfortable to wear and stayed on well for four hours. The formula was lightly hydrating over time.",B
MAC,FLORABUNDI,Lipstick,"a brighter, medium lavender with strong, warm pink undertones and a frosted sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips without tugging. The texture was lightweight, thin but not clingy, and had a touch of slip without being slippery. It wore well for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",A-
MAC,MOXIE,Lipstick,"a deep fuchsia with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, while the texture was dense but not too firm, so I was able to apply it in a single, fluid stroke without the lipstick dragging on my lips during application. The texture was lightweight and wore down to a matte finish within an hour of wear. It stayed on well for over six hours, left a fuchsia stain behind, and was a touch drying after four hours of wear.",A
MAC,TANARAMA,Lipstick,"a light gold with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied decently, but it could have been more even overall. There was a touch of product that gathered in my lip lines, which became more noticeable as the lipstick wore on. The consistency was lightweight, thin with enough slip not to tug but didn‚Äôt slide around while it was on. This shade lasted for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B-
ANASTASIA,ESTELLA,Lipgloss,"a soft, peachy beige base with multi-colored flecks of sparkle and pearl. It‚Äôs one of five new glosses that‚Äôs designed to be sparkling and for layering (‚Äúaren‚Äôt created to deposit pigment/color, they deposit dimensional light catching pearls‚Äù), so the sheer to semi-sheer coverage was as expected.",B-
ANASTASIA,FREYA,Lipgloss,"a medium yellow with warm undertones and multi-colored sparkle and finer pearl. Again, it‚Äôs sort of a one-off of their gloss formula, as it‚Äôs specifically designed to be sheer and add lots of shimmer rather than color coverage. It had sheer to semi-sheer pigmentation with a moderate amount of sparkle‚Äìenough that it was noticeable and effective but didn‚Äôt feel like a coat of metallic lacquer. The gloss was lightweight, smooth, and mostly non-sticky, so it was comfortable and lightly moisturizing over time. The downside was how noticeable the product pulled into every single lip line and just sat there. On me, it lasted for three hours, and in the last hour, I felt some of the texture from the sparkles.",C+
NATASHA DENONA,FAIR (01),Highlighter,"a soft, peachy beige with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It seemed almost sparkling but did not have noticeable sparkle or glitter particles in it. I thought it was a little less shiny compared to the other two shades released in the formula, though it didn‚Äôt emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture and was still highly reflective and yielded an over-the-top glow. The highlighter had rich color coverage paired with a smooth, lightly creamy texture that was more powder than cream but had some of the ease of cream with the blendability and coverage of powder. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before it started to fade noticeably.",A
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,BAR OF GOLD,Palette,"contains three, powder highlighters including the brand‚Äôs original Bar of Gold shade, along with two other gold-inspired shades. All three shades performed well‚Äìpigmented, blendable, long-wearing‚Äìand were easy to use. They aren‚Äôt particularly unique or different among the slew of powder highlighters on the market, but if your stash isn‚Äôt filled to the brim with shades like it, the trio is well worth a look.",A
COLOUR POP,THE ZODIAC,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette that features an array of shimmers, mattes, neutrals, and pops of color. There were a couple of shades that were misses in the palette, but most were good, so if The Aquarius and The Pisces weren‚Äôt the shades you were drooling over, you aren‚Äôt as likely to find the palette lacking.",B
COLOUR POP,SCORPIO MOON,Lipstick,"a medium mauve with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, lightly creamy texture that glided across my lips without tugging and delivered even coverage in a single stroke. There was a very, very slight amount of product I noticed get into my deeper lip lines, but it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance. It wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A
COLOUR POP,WHAT'S YOUR SIGN,Lipstick,"a medium-dark peach with warmer undertones and a satin finish. The color coverage was opaque in a single layer, while the texture was lightweight, lightly creamy, and smooth with good glide. This particular shade seemed to have a touch more slip than most of the Lux Lipsticks, but it wasn‚Äôt actually slippery. There was a slight amount of product that gathered in my deeper lip lines, but it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance; however, the lipstick, overall, was less smoothing of my natural texture than other shades (including Scorpio Moon above). It stayed on well for four and a half hours and was non-drying.",A-
OFRA,GLOW GOALS,Highlighter,"a light-medium copper with strong, warm undertones a metallic sheen. It was soft, slightly dusty in the pan, but it was blendable and adhered evenly to bare skin. It had nearly opaque pigmentation could easily be built up to full coverage with less than a half of a layer on top. It had a strong, metallic sheen on my cheek bones, but it did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture and looked very smooth due to how reflective it was. The color stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me.",A
MAC,TERRY BARBER EYE SEE,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette exclusive to Selfridges. The palette‚Äôs shades were picked by Terry Barber, the director of makeup artistry at MAC and someone who has been with the company for 25 years. The color story is incredibly well-done with a good mix of shimmers and mattes along with light, mid-tone, and deeper shades. As a long-time fan and follower of MAC‚Äôs releases, the shades chosen are quintessential MAC eyeshadow shades. All 15 shades are lovely to work with and either consistent or better than the last version I have purchased.",A
ANASTASIA,VIOLET,Lipstick,"a deep purple with subtle, cool undertones and a flat, matte finish. It was slightly muted, which made it less dupable compared to other purple liquid lipsticks I‚Äôve come across. It had rich color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly in a single layer. The consistency was smooth, fluid, but not too runny or thin, so I didn‚Äôt have issues applying it to my lips. The liquid lipstick dried down within 30 seconds, but it did have a clingier dry down that emphasized the texture of my lips. This shade stayed on well for six and a half hours but was slightly drying over time.",A-
ANASTASIA,PATINA,Highlighter,"a rich, deep copper with warm, brown undertones and fine, golden pearl. It had an intense shine on my skin, which did emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture when worn at medium or higher coverage. The consistency was smooth, fluid without being too thin or watery, and was easy to spread across my bare skin with fingertips or a brush. When I applied it over liquid foundation, it was better applied with a stippling brush as fingertips lifted up my base slightly (but nowhere near as badly as I experienced when this formula first launched). This shade stayed on well for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
L'OREAL,GLEAMING PLUM,Lipstick,"a medium-dark berry with subtle, cool undertones and a soft, pearly sheen. It had sheer coverage, which did not build up well, though it at least applied more evenly than Splendid Blackberry! The lipstick had a smooth, balmy consistency that was thin but not clingy. This shade lasted for three hours, stained very faintly, and was somewhat moisturizing while worn.",D+
L'OREAL,SPLENDID BLACKBERRY,Lipstick,"a deep purple with subtle, cool undertones and a natural sheen. It had sheer coverage, so the color ended up looking warmer on me due to my natural lip color coming through more noticeably. The texture was more slippery, too, so it slid around a bit too fluidly during application. It did not apply evenly and spidered across my lip lines in every direction. The color lasted for three hours, left a faint stain behind, but was lightly hydrating over time.",F
ANASTASIA,NORVINA,Palette,"a new, limited edition 14-shade palette with a mix of shimmers and mattes. I found the palette still leaned a little warmer, but more of the tones in the palette were pink or plum rather than a lot of strong orange. Shades like Rose Gold and Dazzling seemed ‚Äúcooler‚Äù than common takes on the same color, but it‚Äôs by no means a purple-driven palette.",B+
L'OREAL,POLISHED TANGO,Lipstick,"a medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a luminous sheen. The color coverage was semi-opaque, which applied evenly but gathered in my lip lines slightly, though while the shine was around, it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance. It had a lightweight, moderate slip, and was comfortable to apply and to wear. This shade stayed on well for three hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",B-
L'OREAL,LACQUERED STRAWBERRY,Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with subtle, warmer undertones and a luminous sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation paired with a balmy, moderately emollient texture that was thin but not clingy. The lipstick applied evenly and smoothly without tugging, and the color didn‚Äôt seem to emphasize my lip lines. It wore well for four hours and was somewhat moisturizing while worn.",B+
L'OREAL,LAMINATED FUCHSIA,Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with subtle, cool undertones and a luminous finish. The consistency was lightweight, balm-like, and smooth, so it was comfortable to apply as it didn‚Äôt drag or tug on my lips. It seemed a bit thinner than other shades and emphasized my lip lines somewhat, though the deeper hue and shine made that harder to see at a normal distance. It lasted for just over four hours but was hydrating over time.",B
NATASHA DENONA,BRONZE (03),Highlighter,"a bright, sunshine yellow gold with warm undertones and a shiny, metallic finish. It was intensely pigmented‚Äìa little went a long way‚Äìwith an equally intense shine. This particularly shade stood out from some of the more typical gold highlighters we see because it had a much stronger, deeper yellow tone to it. The powder had a smooth, dense consistency that was slightly creamy but still felt and performed like a powder highlighter. I had no trouble picking up the product on a brush and applying it to my skin. It blended out easily along the edges and stayed on well for nine hours on me.",A+
HOURGLASS,FALL 2018,Palette,"contains three, warm-toned blushes‚Äìpeach, coral, and mauve‚Äìthat have a subtle, natural-to-luminous finish. The marbling effect found in the formula can result in variation in color between versions, but all three seemed to have more of the lighter portions that ended up in lighter colors compared to the permanent versions I‚Äôve reviewed in the past. I‚Äôm curious if readers who picked one up have noticed theirs are lighter as well. Other than the color difference, the quality was the same‚Äìsoft, smooth, blendable, and easy to work with. FYI, there‚Äôs about $76.00 worth of Ambient Lighting Blush in the palette.",A
NARS,UNDRESSED II,Palette,"a new, limited edition set of four, full-sized lip colors that‚Äôs exclusive to Nordstrom. Two of the shades are part of the permanent range, which I‚Äôve noted below. The set contains $52 worth of lip gloss and $52 worth of liquid lipstick for a total value of $104, so it‚Äôs a great deal if you like the formula and shades included.",A-
COLOUR POP,THIMBLE,Highlighter,"a soft, light gold with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation when applied with fingertips and medium, buildable coverage when applied with brushes. The highlighter had a smooth, lightly spongy texture that felt wet to the touch but applied and acted more like a powder as soon as it was placed onto the skin. This shade had a noticeable sheen but didn‚Äôt emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. It wore well for over 10 hours on me.",A+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,IRIS BRONZE,Palette,"an exclusive eyeshadow quad (warm-toned neutrals) and two deluxe-sized lipsticks (both exist in the permanent range). The set is sold out online but may still be available in-stores. A normal eyeshadow quad runs $88.00 for 0.35 oz., and the quad included in the set contains 0.29 oz. (but seemed about the same in physical size), while each deluxe-sized lipstick contains 0.03 oz. of product. With that in mind, the set contains $72.91 worth of eyeshadow and $16.50 worth of lipstick for a total value of $89.41.",B+
NARS,UNDRESSED I,Palette,"a new, limited edition set available exclusively at Nordstrom. It includes two Velvet Lip Glides and two Powermatte Lip Pigments; two shades are part of the permanent range (noted below). The set contains $52 worth of lip gloss and $52 worth of liquid lipstick for a total value of $104, so it‚Äôs a great deal if you like the formula and shades included.",B+
OFRA,BLIND THE HATERS,Highlighter,"a rich, medium-dark copper with warm, brown undertones and a metallic sheen. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, soft, and lightly creamy texture that was blendable and easy to apply. It was dense and not at all powdery, but I didn‚Äôt have any trouble picking up product with a tapered highlighting brush. The powder sat well on my skin without emphasizing my skin‚Äôs natural texture, though I wouldn‚Äôt say I have a lot of texture. It had a high-shine finish that reflected light beautifully. This shade lasted well for eight and a half hours on me before fading slightly.",A
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,"GLOWING, PRETTY",Palette,"includes five cheek colors and one setting powder (Medium). While I can understand the inclusion of a finishing powder‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt understand it so much in a release where there‚Äôs just one palette to choose from, since the finishing powder is flesh-toned and not translucent. In larger cheek palettes, there are often shades that may or may not work for a single skin tone, but everything about this palette seemed geared toward fair to light skin tones. I did not find that the powders felt as smooth or as finely-milled as the brand‚Äôs standalone blushes , bronzers/contours, and highlighters.",B+
L'OREAL,DEWEY PETAL,Lipstick,"is a light, bubblegum pink with cool, blue undertones and a glossy sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly but did pull into my lip lines. The lipstick was creamy with moderate slip, which gave it more shine, but likely was why (along with the milkier color) it was more prone to settling in my lip lines. This shade lasted well for three and a half hours but was hydrating while worn.",B
L'OREAL,GLAZED PINK,Lipstick,"is a soft, light-medium pink with subtle, cool undertones and a luminous sheen. It had semi-sheer coverage, which wasn‚Äôt very buildable. The consistency was lightweight, moderately emollient but not too slippery on my lips, and comfortable to apply and to wear. The lipstick did not apply as evenly as other shades, and the product also settled in my lip lines noticeably. It lasted for three hours and was hydrating over time.",C
L'OREAL,LUMINOUS CORAL,Lipstick,"is a soft, medium coral with warm undertones and a soft sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied decently, but it could have yielded more even results. There was a touch of product that gathered in my lip lines, but it wasn‚Äôt too noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The texture was lightly creamy with some slip but did not feel heavy or slide around too readily while I wore it. The color stayed on well for four hours and was moisturizing to me.",B
MAC,PINCH ME,Blush,"is a medium, rosy copper with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque color payoff in a single layer, though the firmer, denser texture worked well with a lighter hand to achieve more buildable coverage if preferred. It was, however, much more pigmented than expected based on the finish (Sheertone). The texture was soft, velvety, and much smoother than past versions I‚Äôve tried of this shade, which made more blendable and easier to work with. On me, it wore well for eight and a half hours before fading noticeably.",B+
NABLA,NOCTURNE,Eyeshadow,"is a medium black with neutral undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation paired with a slightly dusty, drier formula, but it seemed to blend out without too much effort, so I think those who prefer more buildable black eyeshadows would have no trouble with this shade. It lasted well for seven hours on me before fading noticeably.",B
NABLA,RUST,Eyeshadow,"is a deep copper with strong, warm undertones and a frosted sheen. The color payoff was fantastic, while the texture was smooth, lightly creamy, and blendable with excellent adhesion to bare skin. I had no trouble applying or blending this shade out. It stayed on well for eight hours before it started to fade on me.",A
NABLA,SANDY,Eyeshadow,"is a soft brown with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had opaque pigmentation in a single layer that applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin. The consistency was soft, lightly creamy, and dense enough to adhere well without a primer. The color wore well for eight hours on me.",A
NABLA,SENSUELLE,Eyeshadow,"is a soft pink with warmer undertones and flecks of gold and lavender sparkle. It had sheer coverage applied dry and semi-sheer coverage applied with a dampened brush. The texture was on the chunkier side and quite dense and stiff in the pan, so it was a struggle to use it well. I noticed that it became stiffer with subsequent use, too, as the first time I applied it on my arm, it had much greater coverage. This shade didn‚Äôt have a strong base color, so it seemed to have a moderate amount of fallout by the fifth hour of wear.",F
NABLA,SUGAR,Eyeshadow,"is a barely-there peach with warm, golden undertones and a frosted finish. It had sheer coverage and looked significantly different applied than it did in the pan (where it appeared as light-medium pink). The texture was drier and stiffer with a thinner feel, which all likely contributed to the lack of coverage and color trueness. This shade faded noticeably by the sixth hour of wear, though there wasn‚Äôt much to it.",D-
MAC,MOCHA,Blush,"is a medium pink with warm undertones and a matte finish. The texture was soft, velvety, and smooth without being too dense or too stiff in the pan, though it was a thinner texture and firmer feel compared to most powders these days. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that applied fairly evenly and blended out nicely. The color stayed on well for eight hours before it started to fade on me.",B
COLOUR POP,SHOWTIME,Highlighter,"is a soft, pinky-lavender base with flecks of larger sparkle and some pearl. It had less of a metallic sheen on my skin as it just had a bit of a pearly sheen. It had medium, buildable pigmentation applied with a brush and semi-opaque coverage applied with fingertips. The texture was spongy but drier to the touch, so it didn‚Äôt feel quite as smooth as other shades within the formula. There was a very suble to shift from pink to violet on my skin, but it was hard to see even in person, close-up, and contorting myself to find it. The cream highlighter applied fairly well and blended out nicely on bare skin but wasn‚Äôt quite as easy to work with over foundation. It wore well for nine hours on me before it started to fade noticeably.",B+
LORAC,PRO PALETTE 4,Palette,"is the newest in the Pro series featuring a rosy, neutral theme with an assortment of matte and shimmer shades. It‚Äôs permanent and will eventually make its way to Ulta, but it is currently available at Kohl‚Äôs and is on sale for $35.20. I was pleasantly surprised with how well this applied and wore (without primer), as I‚Äôve struggled with some of the brand‚Äôs recent Mega Pro Palettes. The eyeshadows‚Äìparticularly the matte shades‚Äìwere very soft and a little powdery but more substantial so there wasn‚Äôt tons of fallout and shades remained pigmented in practice. Most of the eyeshadows were pigmented, blendable, and easy to work with; a few weren‚Äôt opaque but had buildable coverage but no total misses in the palette.",B+
L'OREAL,ENAMEL RED,Lipstick,"is a rich red with cool undertones and a natural sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a lightweight, lightly emollient texture that was smooth and balm-like, which made it comfortable to apply and to wear. The color applied evenly and lasted well for five hours. It left a faint stain behind and was hydrating over time.",A
L'OREAL,GLASSY GARNET,Lipstick,"is a soft, medium-dark berry with subtle, cool undertones and barely-there pearl paired with a luminous sheen. It had nearly opaque color coverage in a single layer that was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The lipstick was lightweight, thin without being clingy, and balm-like so there was some slip but not enough to feel like it slid around while worn. It stayed on nicely for five hours, left a faint stahin behind, and was moisturizing while worn.",A
OFRA,GLAZED DONUT,Highlighter,"is a bright white with subtle, warm undertones and a metallic sheen. The color coverage was opaque in a single layer, though the texture was soft and yielding, so a lighter hand (or less-dense brush) could be used for more buildable coverage if preferred. The powder was soft to the touch, almost cream-like, dense without being stiff, and blendable on my skin. It wore well for almost nine hours on my cheekbones before fading noticeably.",A+
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,THE PRETTY PINK,Palette,"includes a creamy, pink-coral and muted, deep coral lipsticks paired with a matte, dusty rose pencil. The lipsticks were decent to good, while the lip pencil worked well (and was consistent with the individual pencil I had from before). I tried to layer the three together, but I didn‚Äôt feel the lighter lipstick (Blushing Dream) did much to the color of the deeper lipstick (Rose Kiss).",A-
NABLA,TRIBECA,Eyeshadow,"is a rich, dark brown with subtle, warm undertones and a frosted sheen. It was intensely pigmented with a smooth, lightly creamy, and moderately dense consistency that applied evenly on my lid with good adhesion on bare skin. The color wore well for eight and a half hours on me before visibly fading.",A
NABLA,ENTROPY,Eyeshadow,"is a medium taupe with warmer undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good color payoff that was buildable to full coverage with less than a second layer. It had a smooth, lightly creamy texture that was denser in feel but not thick, which made it easy to work with as the color applied evenly to bare skin but still blended out with minimal effort. The color stayed on well for eight hours on me.",A-
NABLA,VIRGIN ISLAND,Eyeshadow," is a brighter, medium blue with subtle cool undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. It applied similarly whether I used it dry or with a dampened brush, but using a dampened brush ensured smoother, more even application and less initial fallout. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was buildable with a second layer. The texture was soft, denser but still more loosely-packed in the pan, which is why using a dampened brush (or fingertips) seemed to be a must. This shade lasted well for eight hours with slight fallout over time but was one of the better shades, with respect to fallout, within the Top Coat formula.",B-
NABLA,CAMELOT,Eyeshadow,"is a deep, taupe-brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The consistency was slightly dusty in the pan, but it blended out beautifully on the skin and wasn‚Äôt prone to sheering out or having fallout during application. It wore well for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
NABLA,NARCISO,Eyeshadow,"is a soft brown with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had excellent color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin with slight dustiness in the pan, so I‚Äôd recommend tapping off excess to avoid some fallout during application. The consistency was soft and blendable, so it worked well as a transition shade or applied on the lid. It lasted for just over seven and a half hours on me before fading noticeably.",A-
L'OREAL,BURNISHED BLUSH,Lipstick,"is a medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It had good pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The consistency was lightweight, balm-like with an emollient quality but a thinner feel. The color applied evenly across my lips and didn‚Äôt emphasize my lip lines, which can be an issue with some of these types of formulas. This shade wore well for three and a half hours and was hydrating while worn.",A-
L'OREAL,SPARKLING ROSE,Lipstick,"is a medium pink with strong, warm undertones and a luminous sheen. The color did not apply as evenly as other shades in the line-up, and I noticed a bit more product in my lip lines as well, though it wasn‚Äôt too noticeable from a normal viewing distance. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that stayed on well for three and a half hours. The formula felt hydrating while I wore it.",B
L'OREAL,SHINING PEACH,Lipstick,"is a soft, light-medium peach with warm, pink undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation and appeared lighter on my lips than just swatched or in the tube. The texture was balmy, lightweight, and thin without being clingy or prone to wearing away quickly. I was really impressed by how well the lipstick applied‚Äìeven with very little product in my lip lines (and definitely wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance)‚Äìfor such a light color. It lasted for three and a half hours on me and was moisturizing over time.",B+
MAC,BLUSHBABY,Blush,"is a muted, medium pink with warmer undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-sheer, buildable pigmentation (to mostly opaque with three layers) with a smooth, firmer, and denser consistency. The texture didn‚Äôt feel dry (and did feel more finely-milled than my older version of the same shade), so it blended out with little effort on my skin. The color stayed on well for eight hours before fading noticeably.",A-
NYX,TANTILIZING,Eyeshadow,"is a brighter, light-medium orange with subtle, warmer undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a soft, lightly dusty texture that was blendable and easy to work with, though I‚Äôd still recommend a primer as a must-have with this shade to get the most intensity and vibrancy. It wore well for seven hours on me before it started to fade noticeably. (Also, the label itself is spelled ‚ÄúTantilizing,‚Äù though ‚ÄúTantalizing‚Äù seems like what it should be.)",B
NYX,THE NEXT MORNING,Eyeshadow,"is a soft, medium aqua with cool, blue undertones and a matte finish. It was moderately powdery with a chalkier base, which made it prone to sheering out and having poor adhesion to bare skin. It was somewhat better over primer, but it required lots of layers to keep it looking semi-opaque (I could not get opaque coverage) and looked noticeably dulled within five hours of wear (even over primer).",D-
NYX,TRYST,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium, taupe brown with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good color coverage that was buildable to opaque pigmentation with a second layer. The consistency was soft, a touch dusty, but blendable and easy to work with over bare skin (and of course, over primer). The eyeshadow stayed on well for seven and a half hours on my lid.",B+
NYX,UNDERNEATH IT ALL,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium brown with warm, golden undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which applied evenly to bare skin and blended out nicely without losing its coverage. The texture was soft, smooth, and a smidgen dusty but not prone to fallout. It wore well for seven and a half hours on me before it started to fade noticeably.",A-
NYX,UNDRESS ME,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium lavneder with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had medium coverage that was buildable over a primer but dismal over bare skin as the consistency was moderately powdery and drier, so it did not adhere well and had a tendency to get ‚Äúeaten‚Äù by my lid. Without primer, it lasted for four to five hours at best, and with primer, it was closer to eight hours before I noticed fading.",D-
NABLA,DAPHNE NO. 2,Eyeshadow,"a medium plum with warm, brown undertones and a pearly sheen. It had rich color coverage paired with a smooth, moderately dense texture that was lightly creamy and blendable on my skin. The color adhered evenly to bare skin and lasted for just over eight hours on me.",A-
NABLA,SNOWBERRY,Eyeshadow,"a medium pink with strong, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had opaque color coverage that adhered well to bare skin with even application. The consistency was soft, a smidgen powdery but quite blendable and not prone to sheering out or having fallout during application. It lasted just over eight hours on me.",A-
NABLA,UNRESTRICTED,Eyeshadow,"a deep, reddish-plum base with a green-to-gold shifting pearl. It was one of the more unique shades I‚Äôve come across lately and within the Nabla range. It had rich color payoff that applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin, while the texture was dense, lightly creamy, and blendable. The color stayed on well for eight and a half hours before I noticed slight fading.",A
NABLA,DANAE,Eyeshadow,"a medium, golden brown with warm undertones and a sparkling finish. It had good pigmentation both wet and dry, though dampened application helped the product bind better and minimized initial fallout. The texture was denser, lightly emollient, and thinner. It applied fairly easily to bare skin but had some fallout if I applied it dry, and regardless, there was some fallout over the eight hours it wore for.",B-
NABLA,WATER DREAM,Eyeshadow,"a soft, peachy beige with warm undertones and a sparkling finish. It had sheer coverage applied dry and mostly opaque coverage applied wet. The texture was denser but thinner with some noticeable grit/texture from the amount of sparkle in it. I would not use this dry without a tacky base underneath as the fallout was tremendous and caused my eyes to water until I removed it. I had better wear when I just used it with a dampened brush and applied it to my lower lash line to avoid having fallout that caused watery eyes (so I could at least test for longevity). It lasted for seven hours but had moderate fallout over time (even applied with a dampened brush).",C
L'OREAL,GLOSSY FAWN,Lipstick,"a light-medium brown with warm, rosy undertones and a luminous sheen. The texture was balm-like with moderate slip but didn‚Äôt slide around too much on my lips. The color applied evenly with good color coverage, though not quite opaque and this shade was a bit more slippery so it did not build up well. There was a smidgen of color that gathered in my lip lines but wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance. It lasted well for three hours on me and was hydrating on me.",B
L'OREAL,DAZZLING DOE,Lipstick,"a light brown with subtle, warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It was almost like a taupe but light enough that I felt like it was likely better categorized as brown, but it gave such a gray cast at times that I really wanted to say taupe! This shade had good color coverage that was buildable to opaque pigmentation with a second layer. The consistency was lightweight, emollient without being too slippery, and comfortable to wear, though there was a touch of product that slipped into my lip lines. It wore well for three and a half hours and was moisturizing while worn.",B+
L'OREAL,VARNISHED ROSEWOOD,Lipstick,"a muted, medium pink with warm, rosy undertones and a luminous finish. The color coverage was nearly opaque, while the lipstick felt balmy, lightly creamy, and emollient but not slippery. It applied evenly and didn‚Äôt gather in my lip lines. On me, it stayed on well for four hours and was hydrating over time.",A
OFRA,BALI,Highlighter,"a soft, light-medium peachy gold with strong, warm orange undertones and a golden sheen. This was one of the least metallic highlighters I‚Äôve seen from OFRA‚Äìit was still shiny but less shimmery/frosted, so it would be more forgiving compared to other shades on those with more textured skin. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation paired with a soft, but rather dusty, texture, which was unlike the other shades in the formula, as those have denser, more cream-like textures. The highlighter applied evenly and blended out with little effort on my cheekbones. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.",B+
COLOUR POP,PARASOL,Highlighter,"a soft, golden copper with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had opaque pigmentation applied with fingertips (as described) and more medium, buildable coverage when applied with a brush. The consistency was smooth, felt slightly wet to the touch, and had an ultra-light feel on the skin. I had no trouble patting on the color with fingertips for even, diffused application that lasted well for 10 hours on me. This shade is a repromote/returned shade.",A+
CHANEL,QUIET REVOLUTION (312),Palette,"a new, permanent smoky color combination featuring a cool mauve, deep blue-teal, bright blue, and cooler taupe/neutral gray. I found that using the shades together resulted in a rather muddy look, and I had some trouble applying the deeper taupe shade over other shades as it caused the others to lift and resulted in a patchy appearance.",B
YVES SAINT LAURENT,ROSE MIX (412),Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with subtle, warm undertones and a lightly glossy, cream finish. It appeared a bit darker on my lips than it did initially swatched, and the color it stained my lips was even deeper and darker than that. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that did not apply evenly and sank into my lip lines from the get-go. I tried to apply it a few different ways and still could only achieve subpar results each time. The texture was watery and lightweight initially, became tackier and a touch thicker within a few minutes, but it did not self-level or even out for me. The glossiness and lighter color wore well for five hours but the stain stayed present for another two hours from there. The formula was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",C-
YVES SAINT LAURENT,ROUGE REMIX (402),Lipstick,"a bright, medium red with subtle, warm undertones and a glossy, cream finish. It had good color coverage in a single layer, though I wouldn‚Äôt say it was opaque. The consistency was lightweight, watery, and had a lot of slip/wetness initially, but then it thickened a bit and felt somewhat sticky. This shade applied a lot more evenly than others I tried, though there was still room for improvement. It stayed on well for six hours and left behind a strong, red stain that lingered from there. The formula felt slightly moisturizing to me over time.",B
YVES SAINT LAURENT,ROUGE VINYLE (401),Lipstick,"a deep red with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips. The consistency was lightweight and fluid, and it felt wet initially but then seemed to get a bit tacky and thicker, though not heavy or glue-like at all. This shade applied beautifully, particularly compared to some of the others I tried in the same formula, and it smoothed out my lip lines. It lasted well for six hours and had a strong stain that wore for another two to three hours. It seemed to keep my lips hydrated for the most part.",A-
NYX,MAKE ME BLUSH,Eyeshadow,"a muted red with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. I noticed that while it was definitely matte, this particular shade seemed to let my natural skin come through a bit more noticeably so it wasn‚Äôt as flat as other shades in the range. It had good color coverage that applied evenly and blended out easily, though it tended to sheer out a bit without a primer. This texture was soft, a little dry, but it wasn‚Äôt problematic to work with. On me, it lasted well for seven hours on me.",B
NYX,MAYBE LATER,Eyeshadow,"a soft, yellowed brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. It was intensely pigmented with a soft, smooth, and velvety texture that was a touch powdery in the pan but applied evenly to bare skin and maintained its intensity/coverage. The color wore well for seven and a half hours on me before I noticed some fading.",A-
NYX,NOT TODAY,Eyeshadow,"a medium brown with warm, red undertones and a matte finish. It had good color coverage that was buildable to full coverage with two layers. The eyeshadow was slightly dusty in the pan, but it was soft and smooth enough that it remained blendable and easy to work with over bare skin. I noticed slight fading with this shade after seven and a half hours of wear.",B+
NYX,SHAMELESS,Eyeshadow,"a deep, blue-leaning teal with cool undertones and a matte finish. It was richly pigmented with a soft, smooth texture that was a little firmer in the pan compared to other shades (but not powdery or dusty). The eyeshadow applied evenly to bare skin and blended out fairly easily. It wore well for eight hours before fading slightly on me.",B+
NYX,SKINNY DIP,Eyeshadow,"a medium, rosy mauve with warmer undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-sheer pigmentation that was buildable to semi-opaque coverage without a primer but was a shade I wouldn‚Äôt bother to use without a primer as it was just prone to fallout, sheering out, and required far more effort than was worth it. With primer, it was more mangeable and would work well enough as a transition and crease shade. The color stayed on well for six hours on me.",D
NABLA,NEREIDE,Eyeshadow,"a soft taupe with neutral-to-warm undertones and a sparkling finish. It had sheer coverage applied dry and more opaque coverage applied with a dampened brush, but the texture became extremely stiff and harder to work with after one use (that‚Äôs why there are multiple swatches!). I really had to jab at the pan‚Äôs surface for subsequent use, and it did not apply as evenly or stay on the lid as well as it could have. I had fallout while wearing it, and I tried wearing this shade twice, but it caused enough fallout that my eyes were stinging/burning and watering nonstop (something I noticed with a few of the Top Coat shades, so I might be sensitive to something in them). I could not wear this in its entirety for longevity, but based on other shades, I expect the base shade to last around seven hours but it had quite a bit of fallout over time.",D
NABLA,RADIKAL,Eyeshadow,"a deep, olive green with warm undertones and a matte finish. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, velvety consistency that was more substantial than their other mattes, so it had better opacity and adhesion to bare skin and did not require primer. It blended out easily and lasted well for eight hours on me.",A
NABLA,ON THE ROAD,Eyeshadow,"a rich, medium brown with warm, red undertones and a pearly sheen. The eyeshadow had opaque color payoff in a single layer, which applied evenly and smoothly on my bare skin. The consitsency was soft, moderately dense but not stiff, and blendable on my lid. It stayed on nicely for eight hours before it started to fade noticeably.",A-
NABLA,LUDWIG,Eyeshadow,"a deep, reddish brown with warm undertones and a satin sheen. It had rich color coverage with a smooth, dense texture that was applied best with a flatter brush and pressed onto the lid for even, opaque coverage. It took a bit more effort to diffuse and blend out the color. The eyeshadow lasted nicely for eight hours before I noticed signs of it wearing away.",B+
NABLA,JUNO MOON,Eyeshadow,"a medium plum with subtle, warmer undertones and a frosted finish. It had good color payoff that was buildable to opaque pigmentation with a second layer. The eyeshadow had a soft, smooth consistency that wasn‚Äôt too firmly nor too softly pressed in the pan, so it wasn‚Äôt a challenge to work with. It stayed on for eight hours well before there was any noticeable fading.",B+
YVES SAINT LAURENT,EXPLICIT PINK (405),Lipstick,"a bright, medium magenta pink with strong, blue undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which wasn‚Äôt buildable as the formula did not layer well at all (just seemed to make it even more splotchy). The texture was thin and very fluid, which made spreading it easy, at least. The color did not apply evenly, despite trying three different ways/attempts to get it to go on well, but the formula did not self-level and streaked very easily‚Äìif I pressed my lips together, it moved so much of the product around. This shade stained my lips a deep raspberry red. It wore well for five hours before it started to look more like the deep red stain than the brighter pink it was initially, and it was slightly hydrating overall.",D+
YVES SAINT LAURENT,ROSE HAPPENING (403),Lipstick,"a vibrant, deep pink-coral with warm undertones and a lightly glossy, cream finish. It had good color coverage, but the application was dismal, and I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to get the product to apply evenly. The only way to salvage the color was to blot away most of the product and just live with the stain (which was more like a warm red on me). The texture was lightweight but fluid and had a lot of slip, but it also felt wet for awhile, and it did not self-level like some of the Glossy Stains have for me. The coral hue lasted for four to five hours, and the stain came through and was visible for another two hours after that. The formula seemed to be a touch hydrating overall.",C-
FENTY BEAUTY,MOROCCAN SPICE,Palette,"a new, 16-pan palette that features an array of shimmers and mattes with pops of color and warmer neutrals. Per the brand, they are ‚Äúrichly-pigmented‚Äù and have a ‚Äúrich, velvety-smooth‚Äù texture that ‚Äústays put without creasing.‚Äù At some point, the brand mentions ‚Äúrich, velvety-smooth‚Äù and ‚Äúbuildable‚Äù in the same sentence, but they show opaque swatches and refer to high pigmentation at least twice in their spiel, along with the eyeshadow being long-wearing (without mention of the newly-released eyeshadow primer, except under ‚Äúhow to‚Äù).",B
COLOUR POP,DOUBLE DOWN,HIghlighter,"a soft, very light gold with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good pigmentation that was medium and buildable when applied with a brush and more opaque when applied with fingertips (as described). The texture felt smooth, lightly spongy, and slightly wet to the touch, which made it easy to apply and diffuse on the skin without it lifting the base or emphasizing my skin‚Äôs natural texture. This shade was one of the more reflective shades I‚Äôve come across in the brand‚Äôs range. The color stayed on well for 10 hours on me.",A+
GLOSSIER,PUFF,Blush,"a soft, light-medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a natural finish. It had sheer, buildable pigmentation‚Äìup to mostly opaque when applied in three layers‚Äìthat sat beautifully on my skin. Though the blush wasn‚Äôt shimmery, it appeared to have a natural finish and let my skin shine through. I was impressed by how well the color sat on bare skin and didn‚Äôt emphasize my pores or skin texture. The consistency was lightweight, thin and airy with a watery-gel feel to the touch, which made it easy to spread and hard to overdo. It lasted nicely on my cheeks for eight hours before I noticed any fading.",A
BECCA COSMETICS,ENDLESS,Palette,"contains two highlighters and a bronszer inside a single pan. The top highlighter (Moonstone) is rather small and is harder to apply individually, while the other two shades can be applied with smaller face brushes individually. All three shades had good pigmentation, longevity, and blendability, and naturally, they could be swirled together.",A
FLESH BEAUTY,PROMISE,Highlighter,"a soft copper with warm, rosy undertones and a luminous sheen. The consistency was smooth to the touch, blendable without being too powdery or dusty in the pan, and lightly creamy with moderate density but no thickness or stiffness. It had opaque color payoff that applied evenly to bare skin and blended out easily along the edges. The highlighter gave my skin a noticeable glow but wasn‚Äôt metallic and did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. This shade stayed on well for eight hours before it started to fade slightly.",A
NARS,CALL ME,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. It had rich color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips and dried down to a mostly transfer-resistant finish (there was a smidgen of tackiness when I pressed my lips together, but the color did not lift up). The color stayed on well for six and a half hours and was non-drying.",A
NARS,SOMEBODY TO LOVE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, rosy plum with warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. This did not dry down to a fully matte finish (some shades in the formula do, some seem to take far longer to get to matte, as in hours, not minutes) for awhile. The consistency was lightweight, fluid, and spread evenly and smoothly across my lips with full color coverage in a single layer. The lip color was comfortable and had some stretch after it did its initial dry down (mostly matte, mostly transfer-resistant, but if I pressed my lips together, I could tell it was not fully set‚Äìit did not seem to lift up color, though). It lasted well for six hours and was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",A
NARS,SPIN ME,Lipstick,"a deep, reddish burgundy with warmer undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was very thin and almost watery, which made it harder to apply, especially around the edges as the color was too fluid. I also had some translucency, so I would recommend a second layer (more in places than across all of the lips) for better coverage. This shade stayed on nicely for seven hours and was non-drying.",B
MAC,MARGIN,Blush,"a soft, peachy copper with warm undertones and a frosted sheen. It had good color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin. The powder was soft, smooth to the touch, and dense but not too stiff to pick up easily with a brush. The more I buffed and blended the powder on my skin, the more luminous and smooth the finish was. The color stayed on beautifully for eight and a half hours on me.",A-
NYX,I HAVE A HEADACHE,Eyeshadow,"a soft, yellowed beige with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation with a soft, velvety texture and slight powderiness‚Äìso make sure to tap off excess‚Äìand applied best with a slightly denser brush and a pressing and patting motion, then sweeping to blend and spread it across the skin. It wore well for seven hours before fading noticeably on me.",B
NYX,KISS THE DAY,Eyeshadow,"a light yellow with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It was richly pigmented with a soft, lightly powdery consistency that applied surprisingly well to bare skin for such a light, matte shade. There was a touch of fallout and could cause deeper shades to get a little gray, so I preferred to apply this prior to crease shades if I was using it on the brow bone (and then going back in later on to intensify or diffuse as necessary). It lasted well for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
NYX,LAP DANCE,Eyeshadow,"a soft peach with warm, orange undertones and a matte finish. The pigmentation was opaque, while the consistency was soft, smooth, and blendable with just a touch of powderiness that was confined to the pan as it didn‚Äôt sheer out too readily nor have issues with fallout. This shade stayed on nicely for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
NYX,LATE NIGHT LINGERIE,Eyeshadow,"a deep plum with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had medium, buildable pigmentation with a more powdery, slightly grainy texture that had some fallout when I worked with it over bare skin. This type of formula seemed to improve significantly over primer, as it gave the powder something to grip onto compared to bare skin. The color blended out fairly well on me, though. It wore well for seven hours on me before fading noticeably.",C
NYX,LEATHER AND LACE,Eyeshadow,"a soft pink with subtle,w arm undertones and a matte finish. It had good color coverage with a soft, smooth texture that was a smidgen dusty in the pan. It applied well to bare skin and only sheered out a touch, but I would prefer to pair this with primer for better adhesion and longevity, as the eyeshadow only lasted for seven hours on me without.",B+
NYX,LEATHER AND STUDS,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark blue with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had medium, buildable pigmentation (up to semi-opaque without primer, mostly opaque with primer) with a powdery texture that made it more prone to sheering out and had some fallout when I tried to build it up in layers. I would recommend using this with a primer, as it held on better and more evenly with less fallout and better color coverage. It stayed on well for seven hours on me before I noticed fading.",B-
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,LIGHT/MEDIUM (3),Highlighter,"a light-medium, orange-leaning gold with warm undertones and a luminous, glowing sheen. This shade definitely had more depth than Fair or Light (both of which were more close in depth), so for all-over use and mixing, it should be most appropriate for light to medium skin tones. I‚Äôm light to light-medium, and it warmed up my natural skin tone but not in a way that felt like I had just self-tanned, so I could get away with using this shade all-over for a slightly warmer look overall.",A
BITE BEAUTY,BLACK COFFEE,Lipgloss,"a deep plum with subtle, warm undertones and barely-there micro-shimmer. It had semi-sheer coverage that applied smoothly but sank into my lip lines with moderate shine. From afar, the shine helped to minimize the appearance of the color settling into my lip lines but not entirely, so one‚Äôs tolerance for that will really come into play. The consistency was smooth, lightweight, and a touch tacky but not heavy or uncomfortable to wear. It wore well for five hours and was very hydrating while worn.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,DIRTY CHAI,Lipgloss,"a soft, medium coral with warm, rosy undertones and barely-there, gold micro-pearl. The gloss applied smoothly and evenly across my lips, and the plush, smooth consistency seemed to minimize the appearance of many of my lip lines. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that stayed on well for five hours and was moisturizing over time.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,FLAT WHITE,Lipgloss,"a medium, peachy beige with subtle, warmer undertones and a milky, cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly streak-free, but the color did settle into some of my deeper lip lines. The texture was smooth, lightweight, and just a touch tacky, so it didn‚Äôt feel overly slippery but was very comfortable to wear. It wore well for four and a half hours and was hydrating while worn.",B+
GLOSSIER,HAZE,Blush,"a rich berry with cool, blue undertones and a natural finish. Don‚Äôt let the vibrancy and depth of the shade scare you, if you‚Äôre not one for intense blush, because the formula is designed to be sheer and sheer it was. The color coverage was sheer but buildable, so if one wanted more intense and more opaque coverage, three layers put me in that range. The cream blush had a more liquid-like texture‚Äìlike a watery gel‚Äìthat spread nicely across my skin and didn‚Äôt lift up my base products (and also sat well on bare skin). This shade wore well for nine hours before starting to fade a bit.",A+
MELT COSMETICS,TWENTY SEVEN,Palette,"a new, limited edition warm-toned palette with eight mattes and two sparkly shades. The mattes were quite nice‚Äìpigmented, blendable, long-wearing‚Äìbut the two shimmers left something to be desired. The worst part is just that the shimmer shades are not particularly unique or different and yet so disappointing compared to the numerous dupes available. Shimmery golds, bronzes, and coppers seem like shades that any brand at any price point can push out good variations of‚Ä¶ and yet Melt manages to disappoint with them.",B+
MAC,PLUM FOOLERY,Blush,"a soft, medium plum with warm undertones and a satin sheen. It appeared more shimmery when swatched than it did once buffed and blended on my cheeks, as it seemed to take on more of a satin-to-natural finish‚Äìglowing but not overtly shimmery or frosty. It had semi-opaque coverage (it‚Äôs supposed to be sheerer, though) that was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The texture was soft, smooth, and a bit dense, but it wasn‚Äôt stiff to work with. The color applied fairly evenly to my skin, though it could have blended slightly more readily. It wore well for eight hours before I noticed any fading.",B+
NARS,RED DISTRICT,Lipstick,"a rich, deep red with neutral-to-cool undertones and a glossy shine. It had good color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips without settling in my lip lines. It was one of the best-applying cream finish shades in the range. The texture was smooth, light-medium in thickness with light tackiness, but it was very comfortable to wear. The gloss wore well for six hours and was lightly moisturizing on me.",A
NARS,SANTO DOMINGO,Lipstick,"a medium, rosy mauve with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage with a high-shine finish. The texture was lightly tacky, smooth, and spreadable, but it seemed to look ‚Äúbubbly‚Äù on my lips where it was just never smooth and opaque. There was also a bit of product in my lip lines, too. This shade lasted well for four and a half hours on me and was lightly hydrating over time.",B
NARS,VALENCIA,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink-coral with a warm undertone and a creamy, shiny finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly and didn‚Äôt have as much of the ‚Äúbubbling‚Äù issue I experienced with some of the other cream finish shades (like Santo Domingo above). The texture was a bit thicker and noticeable on my lips, though it didn‚Äôt feel like glue, and it had some tackiness. The color stayed on well for six hours and was moisturizing over time.",A
FLESH BEAUTY,GLAZE,Blush,"a medium copper with warm, rusty red undertones and a luminous sheen. It was intensely pigmented with a smooth, velvety texture that was dense without being stiff or too thick, which made it incredibly blendable on my skin. The color went on evenly, diffused easily along the edges, and the finish helped it sit well on skin with a soft sheen that didn‚Äôt emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. This shade stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me before fading slightly.",A
NABLA,FOSSIL,Eyeshadow,"a soft taupe with neutral-to-warm undertones and a matte finish. It had excellent pigmentation with a soft, lightly dusty texture that was on the drier side but applied fine to bare skin and blended out with only a little bit of sheering out (better over primer). It wore well for seven hours on me before fading noticeably.",B
NABLA,INTERFERENCE,Eyeshadow,"a medium, purple-leaning taupe with subtle, cool undertones and a pearl finish. It had good pigmentation, but the consistency was on the drier side and it did not adhere as evenly to bare skin so it took more blending and effort to get even, opaque coverage on my lid. This shade stayed on well for seven and a half hours on me.",B-
NABLA,LILAC WONDER,Eyeshadow,"a light, pinky lavender with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a firmer, thinner consistency that did not apply as evenly onto the lid as it should have. The eyeshadow was somewhat better over primer but was more workable with a dampened brush over primer; on its own, I felt like I was packing it on over and over again. It lasted for just over seven hours on me.",C+
NABLA,MELLOW,Eyeshadow,"soft, golden brown with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a soft, slightly dusty texture, but it was easy to apply and blend out on my lid. This shade wore well for just over seven and a half hours on me before I noticed some fading.",A-
NABLA,MOONRISE,Eyeshadow,"medium-dark, purple-leaning taupe with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was good, though not opaque, while the texture was slightly stiff to work with, so the color did not appear as smooth or apply as evenly onto my lid without primer or some good buffing and pressing to get it to even out. The color stayed on nicely for seven and a half hours before fading a bit.",B
BITE BEAUTY,FRENCH PRESS,Lipgloss,"medium, reddish brown with subtle, warm undertones and barely-there pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly on my lips with a lightweight, lightly tacky texture that sat well on my lips and felt comfortable. There was a very small amount of color that sat in my lips but wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The gloss lasted well for five hours on me and was hydrating over time.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,SALTED CARAMEL,Lipgloss,"a medium peach with warm undertones and fine, micro-pearl with a high-shine finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that covered the lips without streaking, but the milky quality of the gloss seemed to allow it to settle into my lip lines. The shine distracted from the settling somewhat but not entirely when I looked at my lips from a normal viewing distance (rather than magnified). The consistency was lightweight, lightly sticky but smooth and spreadable. It was comfortable to wear, as the formula felt hydrating, and it wore well for four and a half hours on me.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,VANILLA LATTE,Lipgloss,"a light-medium peach with strong, warm yellow undertones paired with a shiny, glossy finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that did not apply evenly and gathered very noticeably into my lip lines. For me, this was one of the worst applying shades in the range. The texture was lightweight and smooth with a touch of tackiness, but it never felt glue-like. It stayed on well for four hours and was quite moisturizing.",B-
GLOSSIER,BEAM,Blush,"a soft, light-medium coral with warm, orange tones and a natural finish. It had sheer, buildable color coverage (semi-opaque with three layers) that sat particularly well on my skin, as it seemed to have a natural finish despite not being dewy or wet in feel. The consistency was thin, like a watery gel, and easy to spread across my cheeks for a natural stain-like appearance. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before fading noticeably.",A
COLOUR POP,SOL,Palette,"the brand‚Äôs newest release for summer that features nine vibrant, warm-toned hues across matte and shimmery finishes. Notably, three of the shades are Pressed Pigments, which is your tip off that they are not safe for eye usage. It‚Äôs a deeper, richer, and more red/coral-toned take compared to Yes, Please (see a comparison between Sol and Yes, Please here). The palette was full of pigmented, long-wearing, and easy-to-use eyeshadows; no complaints here with respect to quality. Whether this one captures your heart is really a matter of how deep your stash is at this point given the numerous warmer palettes we‚Äôve seen over the last few years, but if you haven‚Äôt yet dipped your toes in, this might be a fun one to play with (assuming the Pressed Pigment warning doesn‚Äôt bother you).",A-
FLESH BEAUTY,CERTAIN,Highlighter,"a soft pink with strong, warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It had opaque pigmentation that applied easily to bare skin with even, smooth coverage that diffused with minimal effort along the edges for a seamless glow. The texture was soft to the touch, smooth, and lightly creamy without being too dense or heavy. It wore well for eight hours on me before I noticed slight fading.",A
MAC,FLEUR POWER,Blush,"a vibrant, medium-dark pink with subtle, warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. It was richly pigmented with a soft, velvety texture that was more substantial than most of the brand‚Äôs more matte finishes, though this shade was technically a satin (which read more ‚Äúnatural matte‚Äù on my skin). The intense blush applied evenly to bare skin and blended out well with minimal effort. It stayed on well for eight and a half hours.",A
FLESH BEAUTY,FEVER,Blush,"a vibrant, coral-red with warm, orange undertones and a soft, matte finish. It had good pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage with a second layer‚Äìa little went a long way, though to tint the skin as it was a deeper, more vibrant hue to begin with, so lighter skin tones will likely want to use a very light hand when working with it. The texture was smooth to the touch but firmer and a bit denser, though not really stiff, just a thinner consistency. I expected it to be harder to blend out on my skin, and while the color itself seemed to spread well on my skin, the color looked patchy and almost like it was sitting in my pores. It lasted for eight and a half hours on me.",C+
NABLA,DREAMY,Palette,"a warmer-toned, neutral palette with pops of purple and berry. It‚Äôs not quite as orange or yellow-toned as some neutral palettes as it leans more pink/coral to my eye. Most of the shades were quite good, and when working with the palette as a whole, I didn‚Äôt have any trouble; in fact, it was easy to use and came together well on the eye.",A-
NARS,ABRUZZO,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark plum with subtle, warm undertones and a shimmery finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly across my lips as it spread easily. There was a faint amount of product that settled into some of my deeper lip lines, but it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance as the finish was quite shiny and reflective. The consistency was smooth, light-medium in thickness, and lightly tacky. It wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating on me.",A-
NARS,AT FIRST SIGHT,Lipgloss,"a clear base with a subtle amount of larger gold sparkle and finer pearl. It translated to a sheer, ‚Äúwhite gold‚Äù on my lips, and by the brand‚Äôs description, it was designed to be clear. I wish it had packed with more shimmer in it, which I think would distinguish it from a slew of other, barely-shimmered, translucent glosses. The consistency was smooth, lightly tacky but spreadable and comfortable to wear. The gloss stayed on well for four hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A-
COLOUR POP,MAR,Palette,"one of two newly released powder eyeshadow palettes released by the brand for their summer collection. If you‚Äôre someone who likes a lot of mattes, you may find this combination to be too shimmer-heavy. I liked most of the shades, and I felt like I could come up with some color combinations, but it did take some thinking to blend the cooler shades with all the very warm-toned hues in the palette. I would have loved to have seen less beach, more sea in this color scheme; like a shifting, shimmering blue, frothy silver, kelp green, dirty pewter for sand, and so on.",A-
COLOUR POP,SECRET WEAPON,Lipgloss,"a meidum-dark, reddish-orange with a jelly-like finish. It looked like a glossy stain on the lips due to the semi-sheer coverage, high-shine finish, and lack of shimmer. The color spread well across my lips as the texture was smooth, plush, and almost gel-like without any tackiness. It lasted for three hours on me and was moisturizing to wear. I think the color applied rather evenly but it amplified some of the unevenness of my natural lip color that peeked through (that was what I saw vs. the gloss itself being uneven).",A-
COLOUR POP,IMAGINARIUM,Lipgloss,"a deep, raspberry pink with cool undertones. It had sheer to semi-sheer coverage that applied somewhat evenly, but as it was one of the deeper shades (and therefore seemed more ‚Äúpigmented‚Äù as it altered my natural lip color significantly more than other shades in the range), I could see how the coverage wasn‚Äôt as even in some places. There was also slight color that settled into my lip lines. The glossy shine helped minimize the appearance of the imperfections of application from afar. This shade wore well for three hours and was moisturizing over time.",B
COLOUR POP,PONY UP,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark fuchsia pink with subtle, cool undertones and a glossy finish. It had sheer coverage that gave my lips a noticeable tint, but this one did seem to be harder to apply evenly (and it wasn‚Äôt just the natural unevenness of my actual lip color coming through, at least to my eye). The gloss had a smooth, plush, and comfortable texture that spread easily across my lips. It lasted for two and a half hours on me and was moisturizing while worn.",B
COLOUR POP,PRETTY IN,Lipgloss,"a muted, light-medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a milky, jelly-like finish. It had sheer coverage, which was as described, and had a smooth, lightly creamy texture that was plush but not heavy on my lips. I think that the gloss itself applied fairly evenly, but the unevenness of my natural lips was emphasized due to the pinkish tint of the color itself. This shade stayed on well for two and a half hours on me but was hydrating to wear.",B+
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,FAIR (1),Highlighter,"a soft, very light peach with a fine, pearlescent sheen and lightly dewy finish. My favorite way to use it as a highlighter on top of foundation or mixed in with foundation, though it also worked well fully layered under my foundation or as a standalone highlighter on bare skin.",A
CHANEL,SPLENDEUR ET AUDACE (306),Palette,"consists of a rich copper, mid-tone green, soft black, and dusty blue-teal. The shades work well together, but I expect most will need a complementary palette with other shades to bring everything together (like a transition shade, brow bone shade, etc.). The quality was solid across all four shades with good pigmentation, blendability, and wear.",A-
MAC,GINGERLY,Blush,"a soft, medium peach-brown with warm undertones and a matte finis. The texture was soft, thin but not stiff or firm in the pan, that applied with medium, buildable color coverage (two to three layers for more opaque coverage). The powder blended out with ease on my skin, but I noticed the color deepened slightly over time. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before it started to fade on me.",A-
MELT COSMETICS,BABY GIRL,Palette,"a coral and copper-themed set of shades with two shimmery shades and three matte shades. I liked the shades overall, though one was more of a miss, though I think the set of shades worked better when mixed with a few lighter or more mid-tone shades as using these shades together ended up being very one-note in a way.",B+
CHANEL,MYSTERE ET INTENSITE (304),Palette,"contains a soft brown, coral, black, and deeper berry. I liked the concept more in the pan than on the lid; normally I find Chanel to put together cohesive colors, but the tone of the brown did not work as well with the coral and berry as I expected‚Äìall subjective observations and not part of the actual ratings, as a note. The quality of two shades wasn‚Äôt on-par with most of Chanel‚Äôs newer eyeshadow quads, so the palette left me feeling underwhelmed.",B
COLOUR POP,FEEDBACK,Lipgloss,"a brighter, medium pink-coral with gold flecks of sparkle. It had semi-sheer color payoff in a single layer, while the consistency was smooth, plush, and comfortable to spread out and to wear. It didn‚Äôt feel tacky, and it seemed to smooth out most of my lip lines even though it could have been a bit more even in coverage overall. This shade wore well for three hours and was moisturizing while Iwore it.",B+
COLOUR POP,CHAMPAGNE MAMI,Lipgloss,"a soft, medium pink-coral with fine, peach pearl. It had semi-sheer coverage that applied fairly evenly on my lips with a smooth, lightweight texture that felt like a hybrid cream-gel texture as it was plush and helped smooth out my lip lines. The gloss stayed on well for three hours and was moisturizing while worn.",B+
COLOUR POP,FANTASIA,Lipgloss,"a soft, yellowed peach with fine, barely-there golden pearl with a milky, glossy finish. It had sheer to semi-sheer coverage that applied without streaking, but the milky quality of the color and texture resulted in some product spreading through my lip lines, though not as terribly as I‚Äôve seen in other formulations. The gloss was lightweight, creamy, and non-sticky, so it was comfortable to wear for the two and a half hours it lasted for. It was also hydrating over time.",B
GLOSSIER,MOONSTONE,Highlighter,"a translucent, dewy base with very fine, opal micro-pearl. It didn‚Äôt seem to be white-based, just veering on translucent-to-clear, so it yielded a glossy, wet-look on the skin with subtle pearl. It would work well for someone who has no desire to add color or depth to their look or used to pat over another highlighter to add glossiness without altering the underlying color.",A-
CHANEL,ULTRA FLESH (838),Eyeshadow,"a soft, pink-coral with warm undertones and a pearl sheen. It had opaque pigmentation, but the texture was drier and felt more silicone-heavy to me, which made it harder to apply evenly and even harder to diffuse evenly. The only way I could really get it to blend out was when I used fingertips, but then it was difficult to get any opacity out of the color. It wore well for 11 hours on me before creasing.",B-
CHANEL,VERT METAL (836),Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark forest green with warm, olive undertones and a satin sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable color payoff that applied somewhat evenly but was better as a base or gently sheered out (will be better for someone with a medium or deeper skin tone). The texture was smooth to the touch, dense, and just lightly creamy. It stayed on well for 12 and a half hours on me.",B
COLOUR POP,HERE'S 2 U,Lipgloss,"a subtly, pink-tinted translucent base with pink and gold sparkle. It was a warmer tint to the base, but it didn‚Äôt have much of an impact even on my natural lip color. The texture was lightweight, smooth and lightly creamy without being heavy or tacky, which helped it spread well and feel quite comfortable on the lips. It had a light sprinkling of sparkle, which made it one of those glosses that might be right one one‚Äôs alley, but there are few, noticeable differences between some of the Prismatic shade iterations within the range. It lasted for two hours on me but was very hydrating.",B+
COLOUR POP,ON BOARD,Lipgloss,"subtle, peachy-brown-tinted base with multi-colored flecks of sparkle. It had semi-sheer ‚Äúcoverage‚Äù in the form of sparkle/shimmer, while the tinted base darkened my natural lip color slightly while adding a touch of warmth but the effect will differ from person to person based on whatever their natural lip color is. The texture was smooth and comfortable without being heavy or tacky, and the gloss applied evenly with good shimmer dispersion and didn‚Äôt settle into my lip lines. It stayed on well for three hours and was moisturizing over time.",A-
COLOUR POP,PHEW,Lipgloss,"gold-tinted translucent base paired with multi-colored flecks of sparkle (I saw a more rainbow-like effect overall). It had sheer coverage, as expected based on the finish (Prismatic), but I felt like this had enough sparkle to be noticeable when worn alone without reading 100% glitter but not being too subtle, which some of the other Prismatic finish shades have been (all a matter of preference, though). The texture was lightweight, smooth, and almost creamy as it spread so well across my lips and seemed to plump up my lip lines rather than settle into them. It wore well for two and a half hours on me and was hydrating.",A-
GLOSSIER,STORM,Blush,"medium-dark, reddish plum with subtle, warm undertones and a natural finish. It had sheer, buildable coverage‚Äìup to about medium, where it still retained the translucency of a cheek stain but had more visible color and appeared more true-to-hue applied‚Äìthat sat well on bare skin as well as over a foundation. The consistency was very lightweight and a little airy, but it felt like a thinner gel overall, which helped it spread well across my skin without becoming patchy.",A
MAC,DOLLYMIX,Blush,"bright, light-medium pink with subtle, cool undertones and a soft, pearly sheen. The consistency of my 2018-purchased shade was softer and smoother than past iterations I have‚Äìalmost more slip as a result. It had medium, buildable pigmentation, which seemed in line with the type of finish. It appeared a bit more shimmery built up, but when applied at medium coverage, buffed and blended, it had a more satin sheen‚Äìglowing but not really overtly shimmery. The blush blended out fairly well and lasted nicely for eight hours on me.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,CANCER,Lipstick,"muted, medium mauve with cooler undertones and an almost grayish overtone. The lipstick was noticeably warmer, more like a plummy-mauve on the exterior, but as soon as I swatched it, the interior was grayer and purpler. There were moments where it appeared grayer and other times when it seemed warmer. It had opaque pigmentation with a lightly creamy, smooth consistency that felt a little softer compared to most of the brand‚Äôs lipsticks. It wore well for five and a half hours and was hydrating.",A
MELT COSMETICS,SHE'S IN PARTIES,Palette,"contains four shades ranging from a shimmery pinky-peach, soft mauve, warm, shimmery plum, and deep plum. I think the four shades worked well together as a ‚Äúquad,‚Äù but the quality wasn‚Äôt consistent across the shades, particularly with respect to Last Caress, which was quite sheer.",B
URBAN DECAY,66,Lipstick,"a medium-dark mauve with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It was intensely pigmented with a smooth, velvety texture that glided easily across my lips evenly. The lipstick sat well on my lips and was comfortable to wear. It wore well for six hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A+
URBAN DECAY,MARFA,Lipstick,"available in six finishes, which are primarily distinguished by level of sheen, shimmer content, and coverage. I didn't notice any scent or taste. Mega Mattes are the thinnest and have the most ‚Äúcling‚Äù as they are drier and more matte (but most are semi-matte and not a totally flat matte) and can be drying, though they are longer-wearing.",B
URBAN DECAY,READY,Lipstick,"deep berry with cool undertones and a satin finish with soft pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which was hard to build up. The color was slightly stiffer in the tube, and while it deposited fairly evenly, I noticed splotchiness along the inner portion of my lips, which I couldn‚Äôt seem to fix. It wore well for over six hours but was slightly drying on me.",B
DIOR,WARM NEUTRALS (001),Palette,"includes an eyeshadow primer and eight, powder eyeshadows in a mix of subtly warm and moderately warm-toned hues across shimmer and matte finishes. This was the worst performer between the two variations of palettes that were released (just give me some time to write the other review;thank you for your patience!), though neither were impressive to me.",C
MAC,COCONUT MACAROON,Lipstick,"a soft, pinky-peach with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque color coverage in a single layer, though it wasn‚Äôt the type of texture that worked well for layering as then it felt too heavy, too thick, and too creamy. There was some product in my deeper lip lines. It had a lightweight, moderately emollient texture that felt slippery on my lips for the first hour of wear, and after that, it felt more adhered and almost ‚Äúclingy‚Äù with less glossiness. This shade stayed on well for four and a half hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating. I could smell coconut quite strongly in the tube, but I also got hit with some mint, which was unexpected. I didn‚Äôt notice any taste.",B
MAC,CARAMEL SUGAR,Lipstick,"a deep brown with warm, copper pearl. It had good pigmentation that applied evenly across my lips, though there was a touch of product that gatheredin my lip lines. I didn‚Äôt feel like that was noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The texture was lightweight, creamy and emollient without being heavy or tacky. It took an hour and a half before it felt more ‚Äúset‚Äù on my lips, where the product lost its creaminess and felt a bit thinner and clingier (but not in a bad way). This shade lasted well for five hours and was non-drying. It smelled like a sweet, rich caramel‚Äìnot too sweet‚Äìand had a very slight, sweet taste.",B-
MAC,CREAMY PEACH PIE,Lipstick,"a medium, orange-coral with warm undertones and a soft, pearly sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a smooth, lightly creamy texture that was lightweight and easy to work with. There was a bit of product that gathered in my deeper lip lines, but the reflective finish hid most of that from a normal viewing distance. It started to feel more ‚Äúset‚Äù after an hour of wear, where the creaminess dissipated and the lipstick felt more adhered to my lips. It wore well for five hours and was non-drying. The product smelled like a sweet peach, a little bit synthetic, and didn‚Äôt seem to have any taste that I could detect.",B
MAC,MELBA,Blush,"a soft, muted coral with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage with half of a layer on top. The texture was smooth, velvety, and finely-milled while having a slightly firmer consistency, so there wasn‚Äôt any powderiness in the pan. It applied fairly evenly to bare skin, and it blended out with little effort. The blush stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me, and while some matte shades in the formula darken over time, I didn‚Äôt notice that this one did so.",A-
NABLA,FAHRENHEIT,Eyeshadow,"a slightly muted, medium red with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a soft, lightly dusty texture that was still blendable and easy to work with, just didn‚Äôt feel the best by touch. The color wore well for eight hours on me before fading on me.",A-
NABLA,PETRA,Eyeshadow,"a medium brown with warm, rosy undertones and a matte finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, while the consistency was slightly powdery that resulted in some fallout during application. It applied well to bare skin, blended out nicely, and didn‚Äôt lose its intensity. It stayed on well for eight hours on me before I noticed any fading.",A-
NABLA,PAPRIKA,Eyeshadow,"a soft, medium brown with strong, warm undertones and a matte finish. The texture was soft, velvety, and smooth with good substance and little powderiness (just enough to ensure good blendability!). It had rich color coverage that lasted well for eight hours on me.",A
NABLA,BLUE VELVET,Eyeshadow,"a deep, slightly faded, navy blue with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation with a denser, more substantial texture that was very smooth and velvety. It applied fairly well, but it took slightly more effort to diffuse and even out the coverage on bare skin‚Äìit was less work over a primer, though. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.",B+
NABLA,NEW HEAVEN,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium blue with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was smooth, velvety, and blendable with minimal powderiness but enough substance to adhere beautifully to bare skin without looking faded or sheering out too readily. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that stayed on well for eight hours on me.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,P(R)EACH,Lipgloss,"a light-medium, peachy-coral with warm, orange undertones and a glossy, pearly sheen. It had sheer coverage that applied fairly evenly with minimal settling in my lip lines (but there was some). The texture was lightweight, creamy with a moderate amount of slip, which made it easy to apply, but I could easily over-apply this if I wasn‚Äôt paying attention as a result. The lipstick felt like it was melting against my lips almost immediately‚Äìjust to give an idea of how soft it can feel. It wore well for two and a half hours and was hydrating over time.",B
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,ONE MAUVE TIME,Lipgloss,"a soft, medium mauve with subtle, cool undertones and fine pearl. It had medium coverage, which was more coverage than I anticipated based on the brand‚Äôs description, though I could see many enjoying this level of coverage as it still had that balm-like, emollient feel of the formula. The consistency was very creamy and lightweight, so it glided across my lips with ease. The color stayed on well for four hours and was moisturizing over time.",A-
DIOR,UNIVERSAL (001),Palette,contains two highlighters (first row) and two blushes (bottom row) with all four shades having a shimmery finish that‚Äôs supposed to be ‚Äúeasy-t-blend‚Äù and ‚Äúhighly-concentrated‚Äù that can be ‚Äúworn alone or blended together.‚Äù,A-
MAC,KEY LIME TRIFLE,Lipstick,"a bright, chartreuse green with warm, golden undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, and the very creamy, emollient texture did not bode well for layering as it slid around a lot for the first two hours of wear. Eventually, it ‚Äúset‚Äù and didn‚Äôt slide around, but the product had to wear down (whether through talking, drinking, etc.) for that to occur. The color did not appear streaky along the edges of my lips, but the color did not appear evenly dispersed and some product was in my lip lines. It lasted well for four and a half hours but felt a little drying. This shade smelled exactly like key lime pie: sour, creamy, and graham cracker crust; it did not have any discernible taste to me.",C-
MAC,WILD BERRY FROSTING,Lipstick,"a light-medium blue with cool undertones and a frosted sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied unevenly and sank into most of my lip lines. From afar, the reflective sheen hid a lot of the imperfections, but it was a mess close-up. The consistency was smooth, lightly creamy, and spread easily across my lips, but it just did not want to stay even.",D
MAC,FUNFETTI CAKE,Lipstick,"a pale white with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque color coverage that wasn‚Äôt buildable due to the very creamy, slippery texture that would have just resulted in a ton of product on teeth and in the corners of my mouth. The finish was very reflective, which helped to camouflage a lot of the imperfections in application/lack of opacity. It applied better than I expected, but it wasn‚Äôt perfect by any means. The color lasted for four hours and started to feel ‚Äúset‚Äù after an hour of wear, where it stopped sliding around. It smelled like sweet, vanilla cake but had no discernible taste.",C
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,ORIGINAL,Highlighter,"a soft, champagne gold with warm, peachy undertones and a fine, pearly sheen. It had a luminous, high-shine finish on my skin that didn‚Äôt emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture and was somewhere between radiant and dewy‚Äìmore sheen than glossiness, though. Per the brand, it‚Äôs supposed to have an ‚Äúextreme Hollywood luminous finish ‚Ä¶ that imparts high gloss, brightening and highlighting effects,‚Äù which I‚Äôd completely agree with.",A
MELT COSMETICS,GUN METAL,Palette,"contains two glitter-packed shades, one intensely metallic shade, and one matte. It‚Äôs a hard set of textures to combine and work together, because the glittery shades are incredibly dry, chunky, and very prone to fallout. Even when I tried using an adhesive base with them, there was still fallout while worn, and I did get some in my eye while I wore the palette for testing.",B
NABLA,CLEO,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark gold with warm, brown undertones and a frosted finish. It had good pigmentation with a smooth consistency, but it was a little thinner and I found it harder to pickup evenly with a brush and really had to press and push it on for even application on bare skin. It was somewhat easier over an eyeshadow primer but was easiest to use with a dampened brush, and while the formula is touted as wet/dry, there‚Äôs no indication that it has to be used one way or the other for good results. It lasted for seven and a half hours on me.",B
NABLA,GLITZ,Eyeshadow,"a golden bronze with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, dense texture that applied evenly to bare skin and blended out easily without losing its coverage or shine. This shade wore well for eight hours on me.",A-
NABLA,GLASSWORK,Eyeshadow,"a medium plum with warm undertones and a sparkling finish. Per the brand, it has a ‚Äúsemi-transparent‚Äù base, which accounted for the semi-opaque coverage from this shade. It had a drier, denser texture that was hard to apply dry as it was quite sheer and had a lot of fallout. With a dampened brush, it was more pigmented and less prone to fallout during application. I did have trouble wearing this shade (and several other shades in this range), as there was definite sparkle migration during wear, which did get into my eyes noticeably.",C
NABLA,MADREPERLA,Eyeshadow,"a soft, opalescent beige with a pink-to-violet shift and a satin sheen. The texture was a little drier and stiffer in the pan, and it was thinner on the skin, so it took some pressing and pushing to get good, opaque coverage that was even on the lid. It wore well for seven and a half hours on me.",B-
NABLA,ZOE,Eyeshadow,"a pale green with subtle, warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation with a soft, smooth consistency that was blendable and easy to work with as it wasn‚Äôt too stiff or too dense in the pan. The eyeshadow stayed on well for eight hours before fading on me.",A-
MAC,GUMDROP,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pinky-red with subtle, warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had good color coverage in a single layer with a smooth, lightweight, and moderately creamy texture that had noticeable slip but eventually ‚Äúset‚Äù (after nearly two hours) to a reflective sheen that was more adhered to the lips and did not slide around. The color applied evenly and wore well for six hours on me, and the formula was neither drying nor hydrating. The scent was like a fizzy, fruit punch‚Äìsweet and biting‚Äìand had a very faint sweetness when I tried to taste it.",B+
MAC,STRAWBERRY TORTE,Lipstick,"a rich, ruby red with neutral-to-cool undertones and a soft pearl sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly on my lips, but the texture was more fluid than other shades, which gave it a touch more weight (though not at all heavy) and made it seem over-pigmented as the doe-foot applicator had more product than I really needed for one, even layer on my upper and lower lips. There was a faint amount of product in my deeper lip lines, but it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal distance. After two hours, it ‚Äúset‚Äù and felt a lot less creamy and didn‚Äôt slide around any more, which is why I think the wear ended up being better than a true gloss formula would have been, but it did feel a little clingy to me after that point.",B+
MORPHE,STARDUST,Highlighter,"a cooler, light beige base with pink-to-violet shifting shimmer. There was a noticeable duochrome shift on the skin, though it looked more pink and lavender than beige at most angles. The consistency was smooth, firmer, and thin compared to other shades in the range, but it was soft enough to still pick up well with a highlighting brush and blended out without issue on my skin. It had semi-opaque, buildable coverage and a moderate sheen rather than a frosted or metallic finish on my cheekbones. It didn‚Äôt emphasize my skin‚Äôs texutre at all. The color lasted well for eight hours before fading slightly.",B+
NABLA,DREAMER,Eyeshadow,"a soft, light-medium pewter with soft, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had opaque pigmentation, but the texture was a bit firmer and thinner, which I felt made it a little harder to pick up evenly with a brush. It blended out just fine, so I‚Äôd recommend using a heavier hand with it or an eyeshadow primer underneath to ensure opacity and good adhesion. It wore well for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
NABLA,AURUM,Eyeshadow,"a soft, light-medium green with warm, golden undertones and a frosted finish. It had good pigmentation with a smooth, moderately dense texture that was fairly blendable, but I felt like the shimmer seemed to diffuse and appear less frosted and more satin as I blended it out unless I used an eyeshadow primer or used it with a dampened brush. The color itself blended out nicely along the edges and stayed on well for eight hours on me.",B+
NABLA,ABSINTHE,Eyeshadow,"a deep, plummy brown base with blue-to-teal shifting pearl. It had good pigmentation, but I didn‚Äôt get the same, intense shift that the brand showed on their own website, even when I tried applying it heavily or with a dampened brush. The shift was subtle, but the pearly sheen made it appear different compared to a lot of similar shades in the same hue (most of those are metallic or sparkly). It lasted well for eight hours on me.",B+
NABLA,BABYLON,Eyeshadow,"a faded, medium-dark teal with subtle, cool undertones and a pearly sheen. The texture was denser and stiffer, almost dry to the touch (but not dusty/powdery)‚ÄìI might describe it more like a slightly dried out cream eyeshadow. It had semi-opaque pigmentation but appeared lighter than the pan color, and it had a tendency to fade within seven hours of wear on me.",C+
NABLA,CARAMEL,Eyeshadow,"a soft, yellowed brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation‚Äìwhich I think can totally work, particularly for anyone who tends to work in layers‚Äìso I wish the brand (and other brands!) would embrace buildable pigmentation in some instances. The texture was soft, a smidgen dry, but it was easy to work with and blended out nicely on my lid. The color lasted well for eight hours on me before fading a bit.",B+
NABLA,LUNA,Eyeshadow,"a soft beige with subtle, warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had opaque pigmentation with a smooth, moderately dense texture that wasn‚Äôt stiff nor too softly pressed in the pan, so it applied with good adhesion and blended out with little effort. This shade wore well for eight hours on me.",A-
MELT COSMETICS,DARK MATTER,Palette,"a medium peach, soft brown, rich plum, and deep black. Two shades‚ÄìBlurr and Unseen‚Äìhad sheerer coverage, while two shades‚ÄìEnigma and Dark Matter‚Äìwere fairly pigmented. I think whether the sheerer coverage of the first two shades is a deal-breaker depends more on one‚Äôs skin tone and how one expects to use the set of shades; I could see where some may prefer the softer coverage given the color scheme.",A-
MAC,RASPBERRY CREAM,Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium-dark fuchsia with cool, blue undertones and violet pearl. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a smooth, creamy texture that felt lightweight and applied beautifully to my lips. There was just a smidgen of color in my deeper lip lines, but it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from afar as the shimmer caught the light so well.",A-
MAC,DEATH BY CHOCOLATE,Lipstick,"a deep, reddish-plum with subtle, warm undertones and cooler fuchsia and red pearl. It had good pigmentation that applied evenly across my lips without emphasizing my lip lines too much, though there was slight product that settled there. The metallic sheen helped to camouflage the settling from a normal viewing distance.",B+
GLOSSIER,TOPAZ,Highlighter,"a medium gold with strong, warm yellow undertones and a fine, golden, dewy sheen. Straight from the tube, it had semi-opaque coverage that was buildable, while if I dabbed it on by getting product on my fingertip, it had more sheer to medium, buildable coverage. The texture was lightweight, moderately tacky, and just creamy enough to feel and blend out like a cream highlighter but seemed to stay in place better and was less prone to lifting up base products. The ‚Äúcoverage‚Äù seemed more apparent in person, as my camera picked up more on the dewy glow. The highlighter blended out easily and lasted for eight hours on me‚Äìeven when I tested it over foundation.",A-
DOSE OF COLORS ,SASSY SIENNAS,Palette,"a mix of corals and warmer, reddish-browns all with a matte finish. The formula was soft, moderately powdery, and a little denser/more substantial than the average matte formula, which I felt made these a little harder to use if one isn‚Äôt used to this type of product. They needed to be used with a lighter touch, and even then, sometimes there was still fallout, but they were quite pigmented and lasted for seven to eight hours on me.",B+
MELT COSMETICS,RUST,Palette,"five, warm-toned neutral shades‚Äìfrom beige to rich brown‚Äìall with matte finishes. Two of the eyeshadows were pigmented and easy to apply, but three shades left something to be desired due to softer, overly powdery finishes that made the eyeshadows harder to apply, weaker in pigmentation, and more prone to fallout/sheering out.",B-
MAC,BANANA MUFFINS,Lipstick,"a bright, light-medium tangerine orange with strong, warm yellow undertones and lighter golden-orange pearl that gave it a metallic sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly, but there was a bit of excess product that gathered around the outer corners of my lips and in my deeper lip lines. From afar, the shine and sheen made it hard to see any of the settling, though. It had a lightweight, creamy consistency that was smooth and emollient, but as the shininess wore down (about an hour and a half), it seemed to dry down and feel less creamy. It wore well for four and a half hours and was non-drying over time. It had a sweet, banana-candy scent‚Äìreminded me of childhood banana-flavored candy over a just-peeled banana‚Äìand had no discernible taste.",B-
MAC,SUGAR COOKIES,Lipstick,"a pale pink with subtle, cool undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good pigmentation but wasn‚Äôt opaque, and due to the amount of slip in the formula, it wasn‚Äôt a product I would recommend building up as it would just get very streaky/thick. The texture was lightweight, creamy, and had moderate slip, and there was slight color that gathered in my lip lines, though the metallic sheen made it less noticeable from a normal viewing distance. It had a sweet, buttery scent‚Äìreminiscent of sugar cookies for sure‚Äìthat wasn‚Äôt dominated by vanilla‚Äì and had no discernible taste.. This shade lasted for four and a half hours on me and was non-drying.",C+
MAC,STRAWBERRY MOUSSE,Lipstick,"a light-medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and warmer, golden pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered my lips fairly evenly with less settling into my lip lines than I expected (a little I can see in the close-up photo but I couldn‚Äôt tell in person). The texture was lightweight, creamy, and had moderate slip, and it took about an hour for it to feel more comfortable and less overly-slippery to wear. Once the shine wore away, the product was less emollient and didn‚Äôt slide around at all, and it felt slightly clingy. It stayed on well for five hours but was a touch drying after four hours of wear. It has a strong, sweet strawberry scent‚Äìsmelled like the taste of a Jolly Rancher and a had a subtle, sweet taste",B-
NABLA,SOUL BLOOMING,Palette,"the newest palette from the brand, which contains an assortment of warmer corals and pops of purple/lavender. The color combination worked well, and the majority of the shades were easy to work with‚Äìsome were more buildable in coverage while some of the shimmers would do better with a primer or a dampened brush to maximum coverage and adhesion.",B+
NABLA,PEGASUS,Eyeshadow,"a soft, pale lavender base with strong, warm golden shimmer that gave it a metallic finish. It tended to appear yellower and less mauve/lavender on me in person, regardless of the angle, but perhaps it will lean more mauve/lavender on certain skin tones. The texture was soft, a smidgen dusty in the pan, but it blended out well and had good adhesion and full opacity on its own. It wore well for seven and a half hours on me before fading a bit.",A-
NABLA,MYSTIC,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium mauve with strong, warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had excellent pigmentation with a smooth, almost cream-like texture that was dense but not thick, which made it easy to pick up with brushes but still have the adhesion and smoothness of some of the creamier, silicone-heavy formulas out there. This shade lasted well for seven and a half hours on me.",A-
NABLA,CALYPSO,Eyeshadow,"a medium, warm-toned purple with a sparkling, metallic sheen. The texture was soft, yielding, and lightly creamy, which made it easy to apply and blend out on my lid while retaining its opacity on the lid. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.",A-
NABLA,SELFISH,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, almost gray-leaning purple with flecks of silver sparkle and a frosted finish. It had good pigmentation applied in a single layer, but it did apply better with fingertips or a dampened brush (as the brand recommended) due to the denser texture and the higher amount of sparkle/glitter in it. It was easier to blend when I worked with a dampened brush in particular. This shade stayed on nicely for eight hours but had slight fallout over time.",B+
NABLA,LOTUS,Eyeshadow,"a slightly bright, medium lavender with warm, pink undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was smooth and velvety with enough substance that the eyeshadow gripped onto my lid well without aid of a primer. It had good pigmentation that was buildable to opaque coverage less than half of a layer on top of the first one. It blended out with ease and stayed on nicely for eight hours on me.",A-
NABLA,ERESIA,Eyeshadow,"a medium purple with subtle, warm pink undertones and a matte finish. The texture was smooth, velvety, and substantial‚Äìdense but not heavy or too powdery, but it had enough substance to adhere well to bare skin without sheering out right away. It was easy to apply and blend out, and I was impressed by how pigmented it was‚Äìnearly opaque‚Äìgiven that matte purples are often a trouble spot for brands. It wore well for eight hours on me.",A-
NABLA,CIRCLE,Eyeshadow,"a soft, light-medium mauve with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-sheer coverage, which was buildable to semi-opaque, but it was drier and more dusty, which made it harder to apply evenly and build up in layers. The eyeshadow applied better over an eyeshadow primer, which helped the color adhere and build up. This shade stayed on well for six hours before fading noticeably.",F
GIVENCHY,NUDE CACHEMIRE (101),Lipstick,"a soft, light-medium coral with warm undertones and a cream finish. The consistency was very emollient with a high amount of slip, which made it harder to apply evenly and keep it inside the lip lines due to the rounded applicator. It had nearly opaque color coverage that sank into my lip lines within an hour of wear, though the color stayed on for about four hours. It took three hours or so for most of the sheen to go away. The formula was lightly moisturizing over time.",B+
GIVENCHY,ROSE FLANELLE (202),Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a soft sheen. The pigmentation was nearly opaque with a smooth, lightly creamy texture that had enough slip to glide across my lips well but didn‚Äôt feel overly slippery to wear. The color lasted well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",A-
GIVENCHY,FUCHSIA ANGORA (204),Lipstick,"a rich, deep fuchsia pink with cool undertones and a satin sheen. It had good color coverage, though it wasn‚Äôt opaque, with a smooth, creamy texture that had moderate slip that ‚Äúdried‚Äù down to a soft sheen that felt less emollient within a minute or so. It wore well for five and a half hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A-
MORPHE,MIRAGE,Highlighter,"a medium, coppery brown with warm, reddish undertones and a golden, metallic sheen. The highlighter had rich color payoff in a single layer, which applied evenly and smoothly on my skin. The consistency was soft, lightly creamy, and dense without being too firm or too thick in the pan. It blended out easily on my skin, and it didn‚Äôt accentuate my natural skin texture but was on the edge (to my eye) that it might be a concern for those with more textured skin. The color stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me.",A
GIVENCHY,ROUGE MOHAIR (308),Lipstick,"a vibrant, raspberry pink with subtle, cool undertones and a satin sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, and this one I struggled with as the color looked uneven and almost splotchy in places as if some of the product stained my lips but not everywhere. The texture was thinner and more oily, though it seemed to set a bit faster than other shades. It wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating.",B
GIVENCHY,ROUGE SUEDINE (410),Lipstick,"a deep red with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had good color coverage‚Äìthough not opaque‚Äìwith a smooth, velvety texture that was creamy enough to glide on well but not feel slippery when worn. It seemed to smooth out most of my lip lines, and the color applied very evenly with minimal effort, though the applicator made life more difficult along the cupid‚Äôs bow for me. This shade stayed on nicely for six hours, left a faint stain behind, and was lightly moisturizing.",A
GLOSSIER,QUARTZ,Highlighter,"a soft, warm champagne with a pearlescent, dewy finish. It had buildable coverage‚Äìswiped directly from the tube, it could easily be nearly opaque, and if patted onto the skin with fingertips, the coverage could range from sheer to medium depending on how much product one picked up. The texture was dense and firmer in the tube but as it warmed up, it became more yielding and pliable with light slip for a thinner, cream-based formula that sat well on my skin.",A-
INGLOT,J401 SILVER DOLLAR,Eyeshadow,"a light, silvery lavender with warmer undertones and a silver-to-gold shifting sheen, which tended to look warmer to my eye (most of the time) when I wore it. Despite having quite a bit of larger sparkle in it, the loose powder was finely-milled and soft enough that I could use it dry by pressing and packing the color onto a small area. It was easier to use it with a dampened brush, though, and this minimized fallout during application as well as later on during wear. It definitely added a strong, metallic sheen and could be built up from sheer to opaque coverage. The color stayed on well for eight hours with slight fallout over time.",A-
INGLOT,J403 ETHEREAL,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, reddish-plum with warm undertones and pink and gold sparkle over a metallic finish. It could be applied sheer or opaque, depending on application as well as how much was applied‚Äìvery in line with the description of the formula (see ‚Äúformula overview‚Äù). The texture was soft and finely-milled enough to be blendable and workable on the lid, though it was definitely very sparkly and had a strong, metallic impact on the lid. It wore well for eight hours with slight fallout over time.",A-
INGLOT,J409 COSMIC GLOW,Eyeshadow,"a soft, peachy copper with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. The pigmentation was buildable from sheer to opaque, depending on application and whether it was applied in layers. The texture was soft, smooth, and blendable on the lid and the sparkles seemed to be a bit flatter, so it was easier to apply to the skin without getting a lot of fallout (when used dry). It wore well for eight hours with slight fallout over time.",A-
INGLOT,J411 BLAZING ROSE,Eyeshadow,"a soft, peachy brown with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. It was fairly pigmented, even when I used little, so it was the least buildable shade in the range‚Äìit seemed to have a very strong base color compared to the other shades and wasn‚Äôt quite as metallic. The texture was soft, finely-milled, and blendable on the lid whether I used it dry or damp. This shade stayed on well for eight hours with little fallout over time.",A-
INGLOT,J405 CELESTIAL,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium mauve with subtle, warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. The texture wasn‚Äôt quite as finely-milled as other shades as this seemed to have larger, chunky sparkle and lots of it, which gave it a very pretty effect but made it harder to apply dry without getting a ton of fallout. It was better to use it with a dampened brush, which helped more of the product adhere smoothly to my lid, but there was still some fallout. This shade lasted well for eight hours but had some fallout over time.",B+
MORPHE,LIT,Highlighter,"a pale gold with warm yellow undertones with a soft, frosted sheen. The powder had a smooth, velvety texture that was firmer but not too dense and still soft enough to pick up well with a tapered, highlighting brush. It had opaque color payoff that applied easily to bare skin and blended out with little effort. The effect was noticeable but stopped shy of emphasizing my skin‚Äôs natural texture. This shade wore well for eight and a half hours on me.",A
URBAN DECAY,BORN TO RUN,Palette,"a solid mix of neutrals and color with a deeper, more autumnal-vibe than traditional summer offerings. For long-time fans, there are plenty of shades in the palette reminiscent from past releases, but for those who haven‚Äôt indulged in lots of Urban Decay, it‚Äôs a beautiful palette that‚Äôs high-quality, easy to use, and versatile. It leaned slightly more shimmery, but there were enough mattes and near-mattes that I didn‚Äôt struggle to create looks with the palette. The price point is in a sweet spot (for those who buy mid- and high-end) with lots of variety and a decent pan size (0.02 oz. each) with a slim design (though it‚Äôs definitely a larger palette in terms of width) that should be travel-friendly. The only downside was I wish the mirror/lid stayed up on its own.",A-
MELT COSMETICS,GEMINI,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette featuring shades of brown and green with eight mattes and two shimmers. The palette was good overall except Gemini, a sparkly copper, was terrible, which really brought down the overall score of the palette‚Äìfrom ~91% to ~87%. Having tried some of the brand‚Äôs shimmer/metallic shades in their other offerings, I have no idea what went wrong, and it‚Äôs not like a sparkly/metallic copper is difficult to do as dupes abound. I hope the brand will reconsider bringing it back or perhaps offering the palette in two stacks (I feel the palette divides pretty nicely into two stacks of five), though the green-half is definitely the less dupable side.",B+
ANASTASIA,SEDONA,Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with strong, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips and only tugged slightly (which is good for this formula). The lipstick had a velvety texture that was firmer in the tube but felt thinner on the lips. I noticed that it seemed to sink into my deeper lip lines faintly in the close-up photos, but it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance. This sahde wore nicely for five hours and was non-drying.",A-
ANASTASIA,SOFT TOUCH,Lipstick,a soft pink with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a velvety texture that felt silicone-heavy but had a tendency to look drier and a little powdery on my lips. The texture was thinner and clung to my lips more noticeably. The color stayed on well for four hours and was slightly drying over time.,B
ANASTASIA,SWEET PEA,Lipstick,"a deeper pink with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had good color coverage that applied evenly across my lips but did tug on them as I applied it. The texture was denser and firmer, slightly thick but not heavy, and drier in feel, despite feeling like it had some silicone in it (sort of slippery but dry). The color separated noticeably along my lip lines, and it wasn‚Äôt just around my deeper ones, unfortunately. It lasted well for four and a half hours before it had severely separated and pulled into my lip lines. The formula felt a little drying over time.",C+
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,SPOTLIGHT,Highlighter,"a silvery beige with a hint of warmth and a pearly, dewy sheen. (It‚Äôs described as having a ‚Äúbalanced ratio of pearly gold and silver pigments,‚Äù which didn‚Äôt make me feel so nutty about thinking of it as a ‚Äúsilvery beige.‚Äù) It had sheer to semi-sheer coverage, which was somewhat buildable and amenable to layering, though it is touted as a ‚Äúsheer‚Äù product, so the coverage level was as marketed.",A
SEPHORA,WALKING IN THE SAND (217),Eyeshadow,"a light-medium peach with warm, yellow-orange undertones and a mostly matte finish. There were fine, gold sparkles strewn throughout the product, but it was more to give a certain aesthetic in the pan than work functionally as the sparkles didn‚Äôt translate onto the lid at all (hey, at least that meant no fallout!). It had good pigmentation with a soft, lightly powdery texture that applied well and lasted for six and a half hours on me.",B-
SEPHORA,ANTIQUE COPPER (359),Eyeshadow,"a soft, muted light-medium copper with subtle, warm undertones and a frosted finish. The consistency was soft, blendable, and dense without being too thick or too firmly pressed in the pan, which made it easy to apply and blend out. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that lasted for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
SEPHORA,TAHITIAN PEARL (285),Eyeshadow,"a deep, coppery brown with subtle, warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had excellent pigmentation with a smooth, lightly emollient texture that had more noticeable slip (like a silicone-based primer) that applied well to bare skin but had to be pressed initially to get even adhesion. It wore well for seven and a half hours on me.",A-
SEPHORA,CHOCO EXCESS (297),Eyeshadow,"a medium brown with subtle, warm undertones and flecks of gold glitter over a satin finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, but the texture was dry and stiff, which made it harder to pick up, apply, and blend out on my lid. The glittery bits didn‚Äôt bind with the powder, so they dropped during application and any remaining glitters that stayed on my lid fell out during wear. This shade managed to stay on for seven hours on me.",C-
SEPHORA,GOLDEN PARTY (63),Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark gold with strong, warm orange undertones and a metallic sheen. The liquid lipstick had rich pigmentation in a single layer. It had a lightweight, lightly emollient consistency that spread easily across my lips but dried down to a matte finish. The color separated slightly along my lip lines (particularly the ones on my lower lip, which are deeper), unfortunately. This shade stayed on well for six hours and was non-drying.",A-
SEPHORA,METALLIC CHERRY (64),Lipstick,"a bright, medium red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had opaque color payoff that applied smoothly and fluidly across my lips for even application. The consistency was lightly creamy, thin and very fluid, which made for trickier application as it was too easy to go outside my lip lines due to the pigmentation paired with the texture. I‚Äôd recommend using a separate lip brush to maximize precision. It wore well for six and a half hours and was just a touch drying over time.",A-
MORPHE,EXTRA,Highlighter,"a soft gold with strong, warm undertones and a luminous sheen. The pigmentation was opaque, while the texture was smooth, firmer (so not powderiness), but I didn‚Äôt have any trouble picking up product with a brush and applying and blending it out on my skin. The more I buffed it into my skin, the stronger the sheen became, which I did find emphasized my skin‚Äôs natural texture a bit (at heavier coverage). The color stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me beffore fading noticeably.",A
NARS,ORGASM,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium pink-coral base chocked full of gold shimmer. The base looked creamier, and as a result, it settled into all of my lip lines noticeably (not at all ‚Äúline-free‚Äù), despite the color itself not having any streaking. It had semi-opaque pigmentation (not quite ‚Äúultra-saturated‚Äù as described) and a mirror-like finish‚Äìvery shiny. The consistency was light-medium in thickness but lightweight, though it was moderately tacky (and it wasn‚Äôt supposed to be). It wore well for four hours and was lightly hydrating.",B-
ANASTASIA,HOLLYWOOD,Lipstick,"a medium coral with warm undertones and a matte finish; it was quite well-balanced between pink and orange. The texture was firmer in the tube, a little stiff initially, but it was smooth enough not to appear ragged when applied, even if there was slight tugging. It had good pigmentation that lasted for four and a half hours on me before it had started to fade unevenly and gathered noticeably in my lip lines. The formula was non-drying.",B
ANASTASIA,NUDE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark peach with warm, orange undertones and a matte finish. The texture was more velvety and creamier, so it applied with less tugging and adhered more smoothly to my lips. However, it was thicker and seemed to pull away along my deeper lip lines, so that wasn‚Äôt as impressive. It had opaque coverage that lasted for four and a half hours. The formula was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",B+
ANASTASIA,PETAL,Lipstick,"a medium pink with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. This shade was creamier and smoother, so it didn‚Äôt tug on my lips, but it also had a noticeable shine to its finish compared to other shades in the formula, which were definitely more matte. The lipstick was pigmented, and the color applied evenly but separated slightly along my deeper lip lines and color gathered there over time. It stayed on well for four and a half hours and was non-drying.",B+
JOUER,CELESTIAL,HIghlighter,"a pale pink with subtle, cool undertones and a lu minous sheen. It has a subtle shift from pink to violet. The texture was smooth, soft, and blendable, but it was on the thinner side and wasn‚Äôt quite as cream-like as other Jouer highlighters have been for me in the past. Luckily, that didn‚Äôt seem to impact the overall ease in application and blending, as the powder applied evenly and diffused well along the edges. It had a much more subtle sheen, though, and would suit someone who wants a glow that doesn‚Äôt emphasize skin texture and doesn‚Äôt appear metallic or frosted. The duochrome is more apparent when this is layered with a deeper cheek color than when worn alone (on my skin tone). The color stayed on well for eight hours on me.",A
DOSE OF COLORS ,BLUSHING BERRIES,Palette,"contains a soft coral, muted copper, berry, plum, and soft black with all five being fairly matte in finish. The formula used was more powdery and a bit denser, though it was buildable and blendable overall. I personally felt that there was a bit of a learning curve to minimize fallout, though, and to get the right amount of product on the brush.",B+
MAC,FOLLOW YOUR HEART,Lipstick,"a rich red with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied fairly well; it was drier as it was a lip pencil formula, but it yielded color without having to press hard, and I was able to use the slant of the pencil and get product to transfer evenly. Frankly, it applied quite well all-over color given that it was a traditional lip pencil! This sahde lasted for over six hours, left a faint stain behind, but it was a little drying.",A-
MAC,NEVERMORE,Lipstick,"a blackened purple with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was drier and a little stiff, so the liner needed to be applied in short, quick strokes along the edge of the lips for best results. It did not work as well for filling in the lips all-over due to that drier, slightly tacky consistency that tended to result in some patchiness and product that sat in my lip lines. It wore well for over six hours but was drying over time.",C+
MAC,1 IN A MILLION,Lipgloss,"a dark plum with subtle, warm undertones and violet sparkle. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied without streaking, but the color settled into my lip lines. The texture was light-medium weight feel with a moderately tacky texture. It wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating.",B
MAC,AT YOUR BEST YOU ARE,Lipgloss,"a slightly muted, medium-dark berry with subtle, cool undertones and a jelly-like finish with faint shimmer. It had semi-opaque color coverage in a single layer that applied fairly evenly, but it did sink into my lip lines. It had a moderately sticky consistency with a light-medium weight to it. This shade stayed on well for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",B+
MAC,BROOKLYN BORN,Lipgloss,"a golden beige with warm, yellow undertones and lots of pearl and shimmer. It had medium coverage (mostly from shimmer) that applied evenly and spread easily across my lips (this one was described as sheer, though). The gloss was noticeably tacky and plusher, but it wasn‚Äôt heavy. There was slight color that gathered in my lip lines, but it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance between the shimmer and glossy finish. It wore well for four and a half hours on me and was moisturizing while worn.",B+
MAC,LI LI'S MOTOR CITY,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium peachy-coral with warm undertones and barley-there gold pearl. It had good pigmentation that covered my lips evenly but there was slight product that sank into my lip lines within a few minutes. It had a tacky feel‚Äìtypical of Lipglass‚Äìbut wasn‚Äôt heavy or uncomfortable to wear and spread fairly easily across my lips. It lasted for four and a half hours on me and was hydrating.",B+
HOURGLASS,VISTA,Palette,"a smoky, bronzy palette with a rich golds, deep bronze, and a matte brown and black. The five shades worked well together to create a sultry, warm-toned smoky eye, though I wish the black eyeshadow was a little more blendable.",B+
INGLOT,J323 WALNUT,Eyeshadow,"a soft, taupe-brown with flecks of gold sparkle over a matte finish. The eyeshadow had a soft, blendable texture, but the flecks of sparkle didn‚Äôt bind with the base color, so there was fallout during application/wear (nothing for those sparkles to adhere to). It had good pigmentation that stayed on well for seven and a half hours on me.",B
INGLOT,J327 CHARCOAL,Eyeshadow,"a sooty black with warmer, brown undertones and flecks of gold and copper sparkle. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation with a slightly drier, more powdery texture, but it blended out well and didn‚Äôt have too much fallout from the base color, just the sparkly bits. It wore well for seven hours before fading noticeably, though there was some additional fallout during wear.",C+
INGLOT,J329 TAUPE,Eyeshadow,"a soft, taupe-brown with neutral-to-warm undertones and flecks of gold and copper micro-sparkle over a matte finish. The sparkles barely translated in a swatch, let alone on the lid, and it ended up looking more like a matte eyeshadow on my lid, though there was fallout during application. The texture was soft, smooth, and blendable without being powdery. It had opaque coverage that lasted nicely for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
INGLOT,J333 SHEER GOLD,Eyeshadow,"a soft, peachy-beige with warm undertones and flecks of copper sparkle over a matte finish. It had good pigmentation, though not quite opaque, paired with a soft, lightly dusty texture that had some excess product kicked up in the pan. The sparkles dropped off my lid when I applied the color, and there was continued fallout (of what little was left on the lid) during wear. This shade stayed on well for seven hours.",C+
INGLOT,J335 PEARL,Eyeshadow,"a soft, yellowed beige with warm undertones and flecks of gold and copper sparkle over a matte finish. The texture was soft and somewhat powdery, which resulted in the color sheering out quite a bit. I would only use this with a primer due to the sheerness and powderiness. It had semi-sheer coverage, which did not build up, and lasted for six hours on me with fallout over time.",D
INGLOT,J337 PUMPKIN,Eyeshadow,"a burnt orange with warm, rosy undertones and flecks of gold sparkle over a matte finish. The pigmentation was fantastic, while the consistency was soft, smooth, and just a touch dusty in the pan. It blended out easily and adhered well to bare skin for seven and a half hour wear. The biggest downside was that the majority of the sparkles dropped off my lid when I blended out the eyeshadow initially.",B
SEPHORA,PURPLE RED (99),Lipstick,"a deep plum with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered my lips fairly evenly, but it wasn‚Äôt as pigmented nor did it go on as well as many other shades I‚Äôve tried in the range. From afar, it‚Äôs not as noticeable, and a second layer would help improve coverage and evenness. The texture was slightly thin but still creamy and very fluid, so the color spread well. It lasted for seven hours but faded a bit more heavily from the center of my mouth than ideal. The formula was slightly drying.",B
SEPHORA,RED DESERT (97),Lipstick,"a rich, deep red with cool undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was more watery and almost runny, which I think contributed to the less-opaque coverage‚Äìit was almost a bit stain-like, but I could see some preferring the end result. It would have been easier to apply if it wasn‚Äôt quite as thin, and it seemed to take a little longer to dry down than other shades. It wore well for seven hours, left a stain behind, and was non-drying.",B+
COLOUR POP,STEP RIGHT UP,Palette,"a light, yellow-toned brown bronzer and a warm, beige highlighter. I see this duo being more ‚Äúsuitable‚Äù for fair to light-medium complexions. The highlighter was beautiful and easy to work with, while the bronzer was decent but could have been more pigmented and more blendable overall.",A-
MAYBELLINE,MOLTEN TOPAZ,Highlighter,"a soft, medium-dark gold with warm, brown undertones and a luminous sheen. The texture was soft, smooth, and blendable that was delightfully creamy to the touch, but it was still more loosely pressed (without being powdery), which made it particularly easy to apply with a slew of brushes. For subtle coverage, I‚Äôd recommend a light hand and a tapered highlighting brush or a fan brush with a moderate hand. It had opaque coverage‚Äìnot buildable as described, which was really the only downside to the product‚Äìthat applied evenly to bare skin and blended out with little effort. The finish was the most subtle of all of the highlighters I‚Äôve tried in this formula, which some may prefer and others will lament. On me, this shade stayed on well for eight and a half hours before fading slightly.",A-
DOSE OF COLORS ,REFLECTION,Eyeshadow,"a medium, olive green with strong, warm brown undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. The eyeshadow was richly pigmented with a creamy, smooth texture that was denser and thicker but not stiff or difficult to work with. It applied well to bare skin, and I was able to use a brush with it if preferred without it being an issue. The eyeshadow stayed on well for eight and a half hours before fading slightly.",A
DOSE OF COLORS ,HOT MESH,Eyeshadow,"a deep plum with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. The pigmentation was fantastic with opaque coverage in a single layer. The consistency was smooth, lightly creamy, and blendable with good adhesion in and intensity on my lid. The color wore beautifully for almost nine hours on me.",A+
DOSE OF COLORS ,MY JAM,Eyeshadow,"a medium plum with strong, warm undertones and a sparkling finish. The texture was drier and less yielding, even when I used my fingertips. It had semi-opaque, more faded coverage (it didn‚Äôt look like the color in the pan at all) that was hard to build up. There was fallout when I tried to blend it as the sparkles did not seem to bind as well with the base color. It lasted for eight hours but had moderate fallout over time.",D-
DOSE OF COLORS ,NIGHTSKY,Eyeshadow,"a blackened teal with subtle, cool undertones and a sparkling finish. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, lightly creamy texture that was dense but not stiff, which made it easy to work with when I used fingertips as well as when I used brushes. The eyesahdow wore well for eight and a half hours and had very little fallout over time.",A-
DOSE OF COLORS ,LEAF ME ALONE,Eyeshadow,"a blackened green with subtle, cool undertones and a sparkling finish. It had good pigmentation that applied well to bare skin with fingertips and was fairly workable when applied with a brush (took a couple of layers and more pressing and pushing motions). The texture was smooth, denser but not too stiff or too dry. It stayed on well for eight hours with very little fallout. In practice, I found it didn‚Äôt look very green-like on the lid, though‚Äìthe black base seemed to dominate.",B
INGLOT,J309 OLIVE,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium green with warm undertones and flecks of gold sparkle over a matte finish. The base was pigmented and had a smooth, velvety texture that was easy to work with and applied well, but those sparkles just didn‚Äôt bind that well with the base so that most of the sparkles fell off my lid while I blended and applied the color. The eyeshadow stayed on well for eight hours but had additional fallout over time.",B+
INGLOT,J313 HONEY,Eyeshadow,"a soft, peachy orange with warm undertones and fine, flecks of gold sparkle over a matte finish. It had good color payoff in a single layer that applied well to bare skin with good, even adhesion, but the sparkles did not bind well with the base so there was some fallout during application and more throughout wear with whatever made it to the lid. It lasted for seven and a half hours on me.",B
INGLOT,J317 EGGPLANT,Eyeshadow,"a muted, plummyb rown with subtle, warm undertones and flecks of gold sparkle over a matte finish. It had sheer coverage with a drier, more loosely-pressed consistency that had a ton of excess product that kicked up in the pan. It was hard to apply, as the color did not adhere well to bare skin (primer was somewhat better but not impressive). There was a lot of fallout during wear, and it only wore for six and a half hours before visibly fading on me.",F
INGLOT,J319 CRIMSON,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium plum with warm, red undertones and flecks of gold sparkle over a matte finish. It had medium coverage, but the color looked a lot more faded compared to the shade in the pan, and primer did not improve the intensity. The texture was drier and a little grainy, which made it particularly prone to fallout and sheering out on the lid. The sparkles also fell off my lid when I blended out the eyeshadow in practice. This shade lasted for six hours and also had slight fallout over time.",D+
INGLOT,J321 RICH GOLD,Eyeshadow,"a soft, yellowed brown with warm undertones and flecks of gold sparkle over a matte finish. The eyeshadow had opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin, excepting all the sparkly bits that did not bind well with the base color, so those had a tendency to drop off my lid when I blended out the base color. The texture was soft, blendable, and just a smidgen dusty in the pan. It stayed on well for eight hours before fading slightly.",B+
PAT MCGRATH,GOLD ALLURE,Lipgloss,"a clear base with silver and yellow gold sparkle. It had semi-sheer coverage in the form of shimmer, which dispersed evenly on my lips. The gloss had a smooth, lightweight texture that was easy to apply to my lips, and it didn‚Äôt gather noticeably in my lip lines. The biggest downside was the wear time‚Äìtwo and a half hours‚Äìbut it was hydrating.",B+
PAT MCGRATH,APHRODISIAC,Lipgloss,"a medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied without streaking but sat in my lip lines from the get-go. The consistency was smooth, easy to spread, and very comfortable to wear, at least. It wore well for four hours on me and was moisturizing over time.",B
HUDA BEAUTY,ROSE GOLD REMASTERED,Palette,"a new, permanent palette that‚Äôs a reformulation of the original Rose Gold palette. All the shades are updated, but there are some shades that have been removed and/or updated for this palette. The matte eyeshadows were more pigmented and easier to blend out than the original formula. I didn‚Äôt have any noteworthy issues with them‚Äìa few could have been more pigmented but were buildable, and I didn‚Äôt struggle with any of the shades. About half of the palette was good, but the other half was more inconsistent and problematic.",B-
DOSE OF COLORS ,DOUBLE TAKE,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, plumm brown with sivler sparkle. It had excellent pigmentation when applied with fingertips (as recommended) and then more semi-opaque, buildable coverage when used with a brush. The eyeshadow needed to be pressed onto the lid rather than swept on, as the texture was denser and thinner, so the base color adhered really well to bare skin. The sparkles binding fairly well with the underlying base, which helped minimize fallout. It wore well for eight hours with slight fallout over time.",B+
DOSE OF COLORS ,CAFFEINE QUEEN,Eyeshadow,"a meduim-dark brown with warm undertones and a cooler overtone and silver sparkle. This shade was more unique due to the interplay of warm and cool‚Äìit read very warm in the base then cooler on top. The sparkles seemed to sit a little more on top of the color, though, and there was more fallout if I tried to blend it out on my lid. The texture was a little drier and harder to work with using a brush as a result. This would be a shade better applied with fingertips onto the lid and then only lightly blended along the edge to finish its placement. It wore well for eight hours without fading or creasing, but there was some fallout during wear.",B
DOSE OF COLORS ,WILD AND FREE,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, taupe brown with subtle, warm undertones and flecks of silver sparkle. It had semi-opaque pigmentation applied with fingertips, and it was much worse trying to use a brush with it as it was sheer and wouldn‚Äôt build up. The texture was stiffer and drier, which I think contributed to poorer application across the board. What I managed to get onto my lid seemed to stay on for seven and a half hours, but there was a fair amount of fallout during wear (and lots during application if I blendded out the shade at all).",D-
DOSE OF COLORS ,SKY'S THE LIMIT,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark gray with cool undertones and flecks of silver sparkle. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied unevenly. The texture was drier with larger, chunky sparkles that seemed to cause the underlying pigmentation to look splotchy. I couldn‚Äôt build up the color, and it didn‚Äôt matter if I used fingertips, brushes, or a dampened brush‚Äìit always looked uneven and subpar. There was a lot of fallout from attempting to build up the color during application. It lasted for seven hours but had a lot of fallout during wear.",F
DOSE OF COLORS ,SLINKY,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark pewter with subtle, warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. The consistency was smoother and creamier than most shades in the range, which made it easier to apply to bare skin with fingertips or with brushes. It had opaque pigmentation that adhered evenly to my lid and wore well for eight and a half hours with very little fallout over time.",A-
MAC,HOT AND HEAVY,Highlighter,"a medium gold with warm, peachy-orange undertones and a frosted sheen. It had medium, buildable coverage with a soft, smooth texture that was dense but not stiff to work with. For those who want a more gradual, buildable glow, this shade might work for you, but for those who want an instant, more blinding highlight, it‚Äôll fall short. The powder was blendable without too much effort and sat well on my skin without emphasizing my texture. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.",B+
MAYBELLINE,MOLTEN PEACH,Highlighter,"a light-medium peach with warm, orange undertones and pink-to-gold shifting sparkle and pearl. It was a more metallic, sparkling finish, so if you‚Äôre someone who loathes any larger particles, it might not be the right pick for you. For those who like a more noticeable, stronger and reflective finish, this one may fit the bill. The texture was soft, just loose enough that it was easy to pickup product with a highlighter brush (including the sparkles), and the sparkles seemed to be more fleck-like (flatter), so they adhered better to bare skin and blended out without disappearing. It had opaque coverage (not quite buildable as it‚Äôs marketed, though) that applied easily and lasted for eight and a half hours on me.",A-
COLOUR POP,FORTUNE,Palette,"a new warm-toned set of shades in various finishes and depths. I felt that the palette was cohesive, and it was slightly more red/plum-based compared to past ColourPop palettes (which have read more golden or more orange to my eye). For those who haven‚Äôt picked up palettes in similar color schemes, it would be a nice one to consider.",A-
NARS,ORGASM,Lipstick,"a light-medium pink with soft, warm gold pearl. It‚Äôs supposed to be a ‚Äúsheer wash‚Äù of color with a ‚Äúradiant finish‚Äù paired with hydrating ingredients (like monoi oil). The texture was smooth, lightly creamy, and had a moderate amount of slip‚Äìin short, it felt like an emollient lip balm that slid around on my lips while worn (but was comfortable to wear).",B+
FENTY BEAUTY,SUMMER DAZE,Palette,"contains three iridescent glosses that are designed to ‚Äúapply sheer‚Äù so they can be worn ‚Äúsolo for a prismatic wash of color‚Äù or over another lipstick ‚Äúfor endless new combinations.‚Äù The gloss formula was smooth, non-sticky, and comfortable wear with decent longevity given that they were a sheerer, non-sticky formulation (tackiness usually helps improve wear times in my experience). I didn‚Äôt detect any scent or taste, but vanillin is listed as an ingredient, so I‚Äôd expect that those with better noses may detect a subtle vanilla scent.",B+
COLOUR POP,MIND TRICK,Lipstick,"a medium-dark copper with warm, red undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was fantastic with opaque, even coverage that applied comfortably in a fluid stroke. The texture was smooth, velvety, and creamy enough to glide on but not enough to slip into my lip lines. The color wore well for five and a half hours and was non-drying.",A
COLOUR POP,"CHECK, PLEASE",Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange with strong, warm yellow undertones and a satin finish. The color coverage was opaque in a single layer, while the texture was smooth, creamy without being heavy or thick, and comfortable to wear. I didn‚Äôt have issues with the texture emphasizing my lip lines like I have had with some of the other shades I tested. This shade stayed on beautifully for five hours and was neither drying nor hydrating over time.",A
COLOUR POP,MAXED OUT,Lipstick,"a deep, raspberry pink with cool, blue undertones and a semi-matte finish. The consistency was lightweight, velvety, and thin without being clingy, which resulted in nearly opaque color coverage that applied without streaking. There was a slight bit of color that gravitated toward my lip lines, but it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance. It lasted for six hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
FENTY BEAUTY,SAND CASTLE/MINT'D MOJITO,Palette,"consists of a medium taupe and cool blue. Together, they layered to create a neutral-to-cool leaning pewter, and it could definitely get cooler and more silvery depending on how little or much you used of any particular shade. Both highlighters had good pigmentation, blended out with ease, and lasted for over eight hours on me.",A
BITE BEAUTY,GEMINI,Palette,"two lipsticks in one with each half of the bullet being another shade. The edge is rounded, which is different than the typical Amuse Bouche lipstick bullet. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the application from the bullet and would recommend a lip brush for precision as well as to ensure one doesn‚Äôt get the other half on accident. If you use a lip brush, it‚Äôll be easier to keep more of the bullet clean if you expect to use the shades individually as well as layered. The quality of the formula was in line with past Amuse Bouche shades‚Äìcomfortable, pigmented, long-wearing‚Äìbut I think that releasing a dual-ended lipstick (like they have for the holidays) might have been better. You can view dupes for Gemini (mixed) here.",A
COLOUR POP,TRILL SEEKER,Lipstick,"a medium, cornflower blue with cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good color payoff in a single layer, though it wasn‚Äôt opaque and was hard to build up as the more product I applied, the more obviously the color separated along my lip lines. I really struggled with mitigating how often the color settled into my lip lines, so even though I could smooth it out to some degree by pressing my lips together, it always settled right back into my lip lines. The color stayed on well for four and a half hours, stain slightly, but it had settled quite noticeably within two hours of wear. The good news was that it wasn‚Äôt drying.",C
COLOUR POP,CONFETTI CAKE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, green-leaning teal with subtle, cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque in a single layer, while the consistency was velvety and smooth, which made for a comfortable application, but it pulled away at my lip lines and looked ‚Äúcracked‚Äù applied. It lasted for four and a half hours, stained slightly, and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,UNIVERSAL APPEAL,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, pinky-peach with warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. It had rich color payoff in a single layer, which was easy to apply in a smooth, fluid stroke for even coverage. The consistency was lightweight, thin without being watery, but it dried down to a very clingy, ‚Äútight‚Äù feeling liquid lipstick that was physically uncomfortable to wear for me. It wore well for eight hours but was moderately drying over time.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,VIOLET FATALE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark magenta with cool, blue undertones and a flat, matte finish. The color payoff was nearly opaque in a single layer (you could see a hint of my lip freckle peeking through). It had a smooth, thin consistency that felt lightweight after it had dried down, but the lipstick had a tendency to cling and made my lips feel very tight and just made it uncomfortable to smile (which stretches the lips). This shade stayed on well for over eight hours but was moderately drying to me.",B
BURBERRY,DARK EARTHY,Blush,"a muted, medium-dark brown with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was smooth, dense but not stiff, and blendable on my skin. It had buildable pigmentation (as described) that ranged from medium to opaque (two layers). It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before fading slightly.",A
WET 'N' WILD,STOP RUFFLING MY FEATHERS,Palette,"a new, limited edition quad for summer that features a soft taupe, pale rosy taupe, copper, and golden pink. Three of the four shades are shimmery, but the way I‚Äôve experienced Wet ‚Äòn‚Äô Wild‚Äôs eyeshadow formula, even the more shimmery shades tend to have a more pearlescent sheen applied than intensely reflective. Three of the four shades were fairly easy to work with but one was a big disappointment (and it‚Äôs baffling as to why, given the hue itself, should have been a walk in the park to do).",B-
COLOUR POP,THIRD EYE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark peach with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. The color coverage was opaque in a single stroke, which applied evenly and never tugged or dragged during application. The consistency was lightweight, velvety, and smooth, but it wasn‚Äôt the most flattering finish when worn as it separated along my lip lines a bit, though it wasn‚Äôt too noticeable from a normal viewing distance. It lasted for four hours and was non-drying.",B+
COLOUR POP,NAME DROP,Lipstick,"a medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and a satin finish. It was richly pigmented with a lightweight, smooth, lightly creamy texture that wasn‚Äôt too thin or too thick and glided on without tugging. Unfortunately, the color seemed to separate along my lip lines and settle color there, too. The color stayed on nicely for four hours before settling too noticeably. The formula was non-drying.",B+
COLOUR POP,BIG BREAK,Lipstick,"a medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had opaque color coverage in a single layer that applied evenly and comfortably across my lips, but the color separated along my deeper lip lines and color settled there over time. It wore well for four and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B
FENTY BEAUTY,MIMOSA SUNRISE/SANGRIA SUNSET,Palette,"contains a bright, light tangerine and a rich pink. Together, they created a medium, coral-orange effect with a frosted sheen. Both shades were pigmented, long-wearing, and fairly blendable.",A
PAT MCGRATH,TWILO,Lipgloss,"a medium coral with warm undertones and a shiny, cream finish. The gloss had a smooth, fluid texture that was easy to work with and apply across my lips for even, semi-opaque coverage. It wasn‚Äôt tacky, and there was enough plushness to the formula that made it quite comfortable to have on. This shade lasted for four hours and was hydrating while worn.",B+
PAT MCGRATH,PARAPHERNALIA,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark lavender with warm, pink undertones and faint blue pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that did not apply evenly, and there was slight color that gathered in my lip lines, too. The gloss felt smooth and was comfortable to wear, as it wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin and didn‚Äôt have any tackiness, but I couldn‚Äôt get an even color application. It wore well for four hours and was moisturizing to wear.",C+
PAT MCGRATH,PALE FIRE NECTAR,Lipgloss,"a peach-tinted translucent base with pink and violet sparkle. It had sheer coverage, which seemed a given based on how it appeared swatched and on the applicator. It gave my lips slight warmth, though, and a semi-sheer level of ‚Äúcoverage‚Äù through the sparkles. The consistency was smooth, non-sticky, and plush, which made it comfortable to wear and the sparkle nicely suspended so I couldn‚Äôt feel it when I pressed my lips together. The gloss lasted for three hours on me and was hydrating while worn.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,FETISHIST,Lipstick,"a deep red with subtle, cool undertones and a flat, matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer. The liquid lipstick had a smooth, lightweight, and thin consistency that wasn‚Äôt watery, so it applied evenly and had a fair amount of coverage. The dry down didn‚Äôt take too long, and it didn‚Äôt seem prone to emphasizing my lip lines (but didn‚Äôt smooth them out either‚Äìoccasionally matte, liquid lipsticks can do this), but after it had dried down, it was noticeably tight and clingy on my lips. It was uncomfortable to wear, though it certainly lasted a very long time‚Äìit was still going strong after eight hours‚Äìbut left my lips feeling dry after six hours of wear.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,PUSSYCAT,Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with subtle, warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. The texture was smooth, thin, and fluid initially going on, and it had a longer dry down time when I applied it on my arm (swatches were taken after 10 minutes) but was more typical in dry down (15-30 seconds) on the lips. It has a really clingy dry down, though, that felt immediately drying on me and made my smile look stiffer as my lips just didn‚Äôt have the same flexibility as normal. The liquid lipstick wore exceptionally long‚Äìstill was going strong after eight hours‚Äìand was one of the harder-to-remove formulas I‚Äôve come across. It was moderately drying over time, though it wasn‚Äôt comfortable to wear at all (I expected it to leave my lips feeling much worse than they actually felt in the end).",B
WET 'N' WILD,WHITE RAVEN,Highlighter,"a bright, white-based highlighter with an iridescent blue-to-violet sparkle and finer shimmer. It had medium to semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that was drier and had chunkier sparkle in it, which I found made it harder to apply to the skin evenly. The powder just didn‚Äôt diffuse nor blend out nicely over my skin and seemed to emphasize my skin‚Äôs texture due to the product clumping up on my cheeks. I was surprised that it didn‚Äôt have a stronger sheen after I did my best to blend it out, but I think that it just didn‚Äôt flow seamlessly across my skin and that hurt the intensity of the finish. It wore well for eight hours on me but had some noticeable particles that had migrated through the day.",C-
FENTY BEAUTY,7DAYWKND/POOLSIDE,Palette,"contains a soft, pinky-lavender and a cooler, mid-tone purple. Layered together, they create a neutral-to-warm, mid-tone purple with a strong, metallic finish. When I applied the deeper shade as a blush and then blended the lighter shade on top as a highlighter, it was extremely metallic and did emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture (when worn more heavily).",A-
WET 'N' WILD,HASTA LA COSTA BABY,Palette,"a new, limited edition quad for summer. It included a peachy-brown, white gold, violet, and teal. I‚Äôm always rooting for these types of palettes, since they‚Äôre fun colors and affordable, but too often I‚Äôm left wanting as I was with this one.",B
SEPHORA,RED MAGMA (112),Lipstick,"a bright, deep coral-red with warm undertones and a soft, pearly sheen. It wasn‚Äôt truly metallic, though it definitely had a sheen of sorts. The texture was lightly creamy, thin without being water, and easy to control and maneuver across my lips with opaque, even coverage. After it dried down, it remained a touch tacky, only noticeable when I pressed my lips together, but it didn‚Äôt lift up or disturb the color. The liquid lipstick lasted well for seven and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
SEPHORA,SMOKY QUARTZ (111),Lipstick,"a deep plum with subtle, warm undertones and a metallic finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff that applied fairly evenly, but I struggled to get the liquid lipstick to adhere to my inner lip area. The consistency was a bit thinner and more readily spread out, which might have been why it didn‚Äôt adhere well to certain areas, but I‚Äôm not sure (it happened both times I applied this shade). The dry down was quick and left it transfer-resistant, but there was a little tackiness that persisted for the first few hours of wear, though pressing my lips together didn‚Äôt disturb the color on my lips. On me, it stayed on nicely for seven hours and was slightly drying after five and a half hours of wear.",B+
WET 'N' WILD,HUMMINGBIRD HYPE,Blush,"a light-medium, peachy orange with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer that was easily built up to opaque coverage with a second layer. The texture was smooth to the touch, soft and blendable without being powdery, which made it a versatile formula that could be applied with a lighter hand for sheerer coverage or even just buffed out more for less-intense shine. The finish was luminous and didn‚Äôt emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. This shade stayed on nicely for eight hours before I noticed signs of wear.",A
PAT MCGRATH,DIVINE ROSE,Lipgloss,"a soft, medium pink with warmer undertones and fine gold pearl. It had good color coverage, though not quite opaque, and had more of a cream base that was slightly milky overall. There was a touch of color that sank into my lip lines, but it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance. It had a smooth, plush consistency that was comfortable to wear and non-sticky. This shade wore well for four hours and was hydrating over time.",B+
PAT MCGRATH,BRONZE TEMPTATION,Lipgloss,"a soft, medium coral with gold shimmer. It had medium coverage that went on fairly evenly and didn‚Äôt sink into my lip lines. The gloss had a smooth, lightweight consistency that was plush and comfortable to wear. It wasn‚Äôt tacky and stayed on well for three hours. The formula felt moisturizing while worn.",B
SEPHORA,FROSTED ROSE (61),Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark rosy copper with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had medium coverage in a single layer, so it needed a second layer for more opaque coverage, which also helped to even out the first layer. The texture was smooth, lightweight, and thin with less creaminess than most shades I‚Äôve tried in the range. It dried down in about 15 seconds without feeling clingy. While it didn‚Äôt emphasize my lip lines, it did not smooth them out either. The lipstick lasted well for six hours and was neither drying nor hydrating over time.",B+
SEPHORA,PINK LOLLIPOP (109),Lipstick,"a very light pink with warm undertones and a metallic finish. The consistency was thinner and almost watery compared to the other shades, though I‚Äôd say it had a bit more slip than water. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied somewhat evenly but had a strong tendency to settle into my lip lines as it dried down. This shade stayed on well for five and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",C
WET 'N' WILD,DARE TO SOAR,Blush,"a rich, medium-dark pink with warmer undertones and cooler, violet shimmer. The texture was more firmly pressed in the pan with a denser, slightly drier texture than most of the other ColorIcon cheek colors I‚Äôve tested, so a denser or slightly ‚Äúrougher‚Äù brush worked best for picking up product but also for blending it. Some of my softer, airier brushes didn‚Äôt seem to blend and diffuse the edges as much as I needed with this particular shade as it had a tendency to adhere strongly wherever initially applied. It had good pigmentation that lasted for eight hours on me.",B-
COLOUR POP,FAME,Palette,"a new neutral palette that‚Äôs supposed to be filled with cool-toned shades but would argue that it‚Äôs more of a neutral-to-cool leaning palette than overtly cool-toned. There were several shades that read warm-toned to me whether I looked at them in the pan, swatched, or applied (like Extravaganza, Delirium, Dazzle, Privy). There were a few that appeared cooler applied than they did in the pan (Clubhouse in particular), too.",B
SEPHORA,WARM NUDE (75),Lipstick,"a medium-dark, peachy brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had rich color coverage that applied evenly on my lips, but the dry down did seem to emphasize my lip lines and appeared a little ‚Äúcracked‚Äù when I smiled with a touch of tackiness (which did not lift up color). The consistency was smooth, lightly creamy but still thinner and lightweight, and spread well across my lips. It wore well for six and a half hours and felt a little drying after four and a half hours of wear.",A-
SEPHORA,BRONZE ICON (59),Lipstick,"a dark, coppery brown withw arm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had nearly opaque color payoff in a single layer, and a second layer was doable as the formula was thinner and quick to dry. The texture was lightweight, smooth, and lightly creamy (yet rather thin) so it spread easily across my lips with little work. It felt a little tacky when I pressed my lips together after it dried down, but it didn‚Äôt wear down or lift up the color when I did so. It lasted for six and a half hours and was non-drying while worn.",A-
CHANEL,TWEED EVANESCENT (130),Blush,"a medium pink with warm undertones and sprinkling of fine, golden shimmer. It had more of a satin finish applied than overtly sparkly. The consistency was soft, silky, and a smidgen powdery in the pan but easy to apply and to blend out on my cheeks. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which wasn‚Äôt quite as described (‚Äúsheer blush harmony‚Äù), so that‚Äôll be a let-down for anyone who was in the market for a sheer blush. The texture was soft enough that a lighter hand or less-dense brush could be used for more medium, buildable coverage, though. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before fading noticeably.",B
KAT VON D,GOLD SKOOL,Highlighter,"a pale, white gold with a glittering finish. It had less of a base powder/color and more in the way of a moderate to semi-opaque ‚Äúcoverage‚Äù level of glitter‚Äìthe flatter, more fleck-like kind, which I find adheres better to bare skin and is better at looking sparkling without appearing like specks of dirt from afar. I don‚Äôt expect this to be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, though, as it is, undoubtedly, over-the-top and glittery. It had a subtle, duochrome shift from pale gold to warmer, yellow gold depending on the angle.",B
WET 'N' WILD,DON'T FLUTTER YOURSELF,Blush,"a soft, light pink with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin. The consistency was soft, dense but not stiff or dry to work with, and incredibly blendable. The finish was luminous and reflective without accentuating my skin‚Äôs natural texture. It wore well for eight hours before fading slightly on me.",A
GUERLAIN,RAINBOW PEARLS,Highlighter,"a translucent powder that is supposed to have ‚Äúsix new shades‚Äù that ‚Äúdiffuse redness and dark spots‚Äù and minimize ‚Äúareas of shadow‚Äù and ‚Äúcounter dullness.‚Äù Per the description, it states to use it to ‚Äúset make-up and revive the complexion.‚Äù It seemed to neutralize some of the natural redness in my skin when applied over bare skin (maybe by 10-15%), but when I used it over foundation, the effect wasn‚Äôt necessary given that the foundation was doing the heavy lifting anyway. It did more in the way of softening out my natural texture and giving my foundation a soft focus finish without being too flat or too powdery. I don‚Äôt think that it did that much to ‚Äúcounter dullness‚Äù nor minimize ‚Äúareas of shadow.‚Äù",B
MAC,DELPHIC,Bronzer,"a medium-brown with warm, yellow undertones and a luminous sheen. It had good pigmentation with a smooth, moderately dense texture that was firmer but released product without having to use heavy pressure or an ultra-dense brush‚Äìnot quite as yielding as other Extra Dimension formulas but better than Golden Rinse was for me. It had a soft sheen on my skin, which didn‚Äôt look overly shimmery but more natural and worked well for a bronzing powder. It applied evenly and blended out easily when I tested it. This shade lasted for eight hours before fading noticeably on me.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,COPPER CHIC,Lipgloss,"a medium, rosy copper with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips. The finish emphasized my lip lines slightly as there was a touch of color that gathered in my deeper lip lines, but the high-shine finish made it hard to detect from a normal viewing distance. The gloss was lightweight but had a light-medium thickness and noticeable tackiness, which helped it last for a solid five hours on me. The formula was comfortable and hydrating to wear.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,METAL FLAME,Lipgloss,"a rich, medium-dark orange-red with warm undertones and fine, golden shimmer. It had nearly opaque color coverage in a single layer that applied fairly evenly. I noticed subtle streaking just along the outer edge of my lower lip in the close-up photo but couldn‚Äôt see that in person. The gloss seemed to be more smoothing of my lip lines compared to Copper Chic. The consistency was smooth, lightweight, and had moderate tackiness but did not feel heavy or glue-like. It wore well for six hours and was hydrating while worn.",A-
OFRA,BLISSFUL,Highlighter,"a medium, rosy copper with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. The texture was dense but soft enough to pickup with a brush without having to jab at the surface; there was a little creaminess when I pressed my fingertip against the surface. The latter seemed to help diffuse and smooth out the powder on my skin as I buffed and blended it on my cheekbones. It had good pigmentation that built up to full coverage with less than half of a layer on top. The finish was high-shine and metallic, but it seemed to stop just shy of emphasizing my skin‚Äôs natural texture (I‚Äôd say I only have slight texture naturally, though). It wore well for eight and a half hours on me.",A-
MAC,MOTHER O' PEARL,Blush,"a soft, medium pink with warm undertones and a soft, pearly sheen. It had medium to semi-opaque, buildable coverage with a soft, lightly dusty texture that had a little extra powder kicked up in the pan but did not appear dry or chalky on my skin. I noticed that the color darkened just slightly five minutes after I had applied it, but I didn‚Äôt notice any further ddarkening over time. The blush stayed on well for seven and a half hours before I noticed any fading.",B-
KEVYN AUCOIN,PINK SAND,Blush,"a medium pink with strong, warm undertones and a luminous finish. It could also be applied more in a gradient on the skin as it appeared in the pan, which gave it a stronger pink hue on the apples of my cheeks. The texture as a whole was soft, blendable, and easy to work with and had good pigmentation in a single layer. Together, it wore well for eight and a half hours on me. Individually, two shades were pigmented but one was more medium coverage (but buildable), and all three wore for at least eight hours on me.",B+
SEPHORA,DAY DREAMING (81),Lipstick,"a medium, rosy mauve with neutral-to-cool undertones and a flat, matte finish. The color payoff was opaque with a smooth, fluid consistency that was thin but not watery. It applied evenly across my lips, but after it had dried down and did accentuate my lip lines a bit on the lower lip but seemed fine on my upper lip. This shade wore well for seven and a half hours and was slightly drying after four hours of wear.",A-
SEPHORA,ENGLISH ROSE (86),Lipstick,"a medium-dark, rosy plum with subtle, warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. The consistency was smooth, lightly creamy, and fluid that was thin but not watery, so the color spread very easily across my lips (almost too easily!). It had opaque color payoff that dried down evenly and didn‚Äôt emphasize the texture of my lips. The color lasted well for almost eight hours and made it through a meal and water. The formula was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",A
MAC,BAIANA BRONZE,Bronzer,"a muted, medium brown with subtle, warm yellow undertones and a matte finish. It had sheer coverage even after I jabbed, pushed, and scraped off layers of product and pressed the product firmly against my skin‚Äìit didn‚Äôt matter whether I used fingertips or a brush (fingertips were worse as the texture was chalky and all the powder stuck to my finger and did not translate well onto my skin). It would have, effectively, had visibly no color payoff in just one layer (and per MAC‚Äôs most recent description of the powder, it is supposed to be sheer). The pigmentation problem seemed to be more the result of the texture as the product just didn‚Äôt adhere well to my skin.",F
MAC,SOFT SHELL,Lipgloss,"a medium, caramel brown with warm, multi-colored shimmer (though predominantly gold and bronze). It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied smoothly and fluidly across my lips. The gloss had a light-medium thickness and weight that gave it a plusher feel, but it was also moderately tacky, which I know can be a deal-breaker for some. This shade wore well for five hours and was moisturizing while worn.",A
MAC,STRIP 'N' DIP,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark, peachy-orange with warm, reddish undertones and a fine, metallic shimmer finish. The color payoff was nearly opaque in a single layer, while the gloss had a smooth, light-medium weight texture that was tacky but not so thick or heavy that it felt like glue to me. The gloss stayed on well for five hours and was hydrating over time.",A
MAC,TREASURE BEACH,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and fine, violet pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied smoothly across my lips for even coverage. The gloss had a light-medium weight and thickness with moderate stickiness, though it seemed to help the product adhere and last longer as this shade wore well for almost six hours on me. THe formula felt hydrating while worn.",A-
MAC,GOLDEN RINSE,Bronzer,"a soft, light-medium rosy brown with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation paired with a dense, firmer texture that was thin and a little dry in feel. It wasn‚Äôt as yielding compared to other Extra Dimension formulas, which have a similar firmness to the touch but typically pickup product just fine with the usual slew of brushes. I felt I had to push and lightly jab at the surface to get the product loosened from the surface. I didn‚Äôt have any issues diffusing or blending out the edges, and the color stayed on well for eight hours (shy of the 10 hours promised).",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,EROTIC,Lipgloss,"a rich, medium red with cool, blue undertones and a high-shine, glossy finish with barely-there pearl. The formula has a very wet, thin feel going on‚Äìcooling in a way‚Äìand then quickly develops to a thicker, more gel-like texture that feels plusher on the lips and has light-to-moderate tackiness. The shine lasts incredibly long on this formula, as does the color and the stain that lingers on even beyond that. For me, the shine and color were still noticeable after eight hours (which survived a meal), while the formula was very hydrating and comfortable to wear.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,NO VACANCY,Lipgloss,"a vibrant, medium red with neutral undertones and a glossy, jelly-like finish. It had nearly opaque color payoff in a single layer with a thin, watery texture initially that then developed into a plusher, thicker consistency that had light tackiness to it. The color held on exceptionally well to lips for excellent, eight-hour wear (most of that with visible shine) that was comfortable and hydrating while smoothing out my lip lines.",A
SEPHORA,BLAZE OF GLORY (76),Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark red-brown with warm, rusty undertones and a flat, matte finish. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, lightly creamy texture that was thin without being watery. It dried down within 30 seconds to a mostly matte finish, but there was a touch of tackiness present whenever I pressed my lips together (but no color lifted) for the first couple hours of wear. This shade stayed on well for eight hours and made it through eating/drinking without being a drying formula.",A
SEPHORA,CLASSIC BEIGE (02),Lipstick,"a light-medium, rosy brown with warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips without emphasizing my lip lines (but it wasn‚Äôt quite as smoothing of my lip lines as some shades have been in the formula!). The texture was very lightweight after it had dried down with some tackiness (but color didn‚Äôt lift when I pressed my lips together) for the first few hours of wear. It was originally a very fluid, lightly creamy texture that was thin but not at all watery or hard to maneuver along my lips. The color wore well for seven hours and was non-drying.",A
MAC,DUST OFF,Eyeshadow,"a soft, white gold with warm, yellow undertones and a sparkling, frosted finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a drier, more loosely-pressed consistency that had some fallout during application (even when I felt like I tapped away the excess) as it didn‚Äôt adhere as well to bare skin. It worked better with a dampened brush (primer was slightly better but not a total problem solver), which helped combine the powder to go onto the lid more smoothly and improved the pigmentation. Alternatively, pressing and gently pushing and patting it on using a flat, synthetic brush worked fairly well but still required a little cleanup afterward. On its own, the eyeshadow wore well for seven hours on me.",C+
MAC,SUN SPECK,Eyeshadow,"a medium peach with warm undertones and flecks of copper micro-sparkle paired with a frosted finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage that wasn‚Äôt buildable on its own, and it had moderate fallout during application as it seemed to have a looser, drier consistency. I would strongly recommend using this with a dampened brush to improve coverage and adhesion to the lid while minimizing fallout. By itself, the eyeshadow stayed on well for seven hours before it started to look faded.",C
MAC,"SUN, TAN AND REPEAT",Eyeshadow,"a medium, reddish-brown with strong, warm undertones and cooler, green-to-blue shifting pearl. It needed to be layered to have a visible, duochrome effect no the lid, or else, a dampened brush worked well to bring in more depth from the base color while enhancing the shimmery finish. The texture was slightly dry to the touch with moderate slip from the dimethicone in the formula (definitely felt a little different than typical MAC eyeshadows to me). This shade lasted well for seven and a half hours on me.",B
MAC,SLOW AS YOU GLOW,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark plum with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had good pigmentation, but it wasn‚Äôt fully opaque, and there was something about the applied color that looked more faded and had less depth compared to the shade in the pan. The texture was drier with some slip, so it blended out nicely but was prone to sheering out a little quickly so care needed to be paid attention to avoid losing opacity. It wore well for seven and a half hours on me before fading.",B
SEPHORA,VIOLET VERTIGO (103),Lipstick,"a rich, deep violet purple with cool, blue undertones and a matte finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation in a single layer, but the texture was a little thinner and overly fluid, which made it harder to get and retain even application along the edges of my lips. It dried down quickly but emphasized my lip texture and looked more ‚Äúshrink-wrapped‚Äù compared to other matte shades in the range, which appeared more smoothing. The color stayed on for well over eight hours but was somewhat drying after five hours of wear.",B
SEPHORA,VOLUPTUOUS BURGUNDY (58),Lipstick," deep burgundy with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque color payoff that applied fairly evenly on me, though there was some color that sank into my deeper lip lines. I didn‚Äôt feel that it was noticeable from a normal viewing distance, though. The texture was lightweight, thin, and creamy with a lot of slip, so it was easy to spread across my lips. It dried down within 20 seconds for the most part but was a bit tacky when I pressed my lips together for the first half hour of wear, but it didn‚Äôt lift or disturb the color so it wasn‚Äôt a real issue. This shade wore well for over eight hours but was slightly drying after six hours of wear.",A-
COLOUR POP,BIRTHDAY WISH,Eyeshadow,"a soft, muted gold with a sparkling, glittery finish. The consistency was smooth, lightly emollient without being too slippery, and yielded semi-opaque pigmentation in a single layer (almost opaque when patted onto the skin with a fingertip). It felt and performed like most of the brand‚Äôs ‚ÄúUltra-Glitter‚Äù finish shades‚Äìparticularly good for layering, inner corner highlighting, and the like. It wore well for 10 hours with very little fallout.",A-
MAC,BEACH NUT,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, muted purple with subtle,w arm undertones and a satin finish. The color payoff was fantastic with smooth, even coverage in a single layer. The lipstick had a firmer, denser feel in the tube but glided across my lips without dragging. It wore well for six hours, left a faint, pinkish stain behind, and was non-drying. It was listed as a matte, but it didn‚Äôt look matte until after a few hours of wear (after the shine wore away).",A
MAC,GOODBYE KISS,Lipstick,"a slightly bright, medium pink with cool, blue undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a lightweight, lightly creamy texture that had moderate slip but adhered well to my lips and didn‚Äôt slide around while worn. The lipstick stayed on well for four and a half hours with a lightly hydrating feel.",A-
SMASHBOX,ROSE GLITZ,Highlighter,"a clear base with light gold and deeper gold sparkle glitter. One layer produced a semi-sheer amount of sparkle/glitter whether patted onto lips or patted onto cheekbones, and then intensified to semi-opaque coverage with two to three layers, though I did find that on the cheeks it started to look a bit textured after three layers.",A
SEPHORA,TWINKLE TWINKLE (362),Eyeshadow,"a light-medium peach with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. It had opaque pigmentation with a smooth, almost cream-like texture that was dense but not stiff or heavy, though with the amount of glitter in it, I found it worked better with synthetic brushes. The eyeshadow was easy to apply in a patting and pressing motion but over-blending did result in some fallout. It wore well for eight hours with slight fallout over time.",B+
SEPHORA,GIRL NIGHT OUT (216),Eyeshadow,"a bright, deep gold with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. It was intensely pigmented and had a really smooth, cream-like texture that was dense without being stiff to work with, so I had no trouble getting full coverage onto the lid nor with blending out the edges. The eyeshadow lasted nicely for eight hours, and I didn‚Äôt notice any fallout from it over time.",A
SEPHORA,COPPER RUSH (291),Eyeshadow,"a deep copper with warm, brownish undertones and a metallic sheen. It had rich, opaque pigmentation with a soft, blendable texture that was moderately dense and a little cream-like but wasn‚Äôt too thick or too stiff in the pan. This shade wore well for eight hours on me before fading a bit.",A-
SEPHORA,SWEET LOLLIPOP (356),Eyeshadow,"a medium coral with warm undertones and a pink-to-copper shifting sparkle. It had sheer coverage that was somewhat improved by using a dampened brush, where I was able to get more medium and buildable coverage, but the texture was drier and almost stiff to work with. The eyeshadow seemed to stay on for six and a half hours but it was sheer enough that it was harder to gauge the wear time.",F
GIVENCHY,AFRICAN LIGHT GOLD,Highlighter," a soft, light-medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a satin sheen. It‚Äôs a new, limited edition cream-based highlighter that has a slightly cool-to-the-touch sensation when initially applied, but it has an overly-emollient texture that seems to dry down incredibly quickly to the point where all it did was catch on texture and separate the more I tried to blend it out. I tried using fingertips, brushes, and sponges to apply and to blend out the product, and I did not feel like anything worked well.",F
MAC,HUMOUR ME,Blush,"a dirty, plummy brown with neutral-to-warm undertones and a matte finish. It had medium, buildable coverage‚Äìvery true to the brand‚Äôs description‚Äìthat applied easily to bare skin as each layer went on evenly and blended well along the edges. The consistency was smooth to the touch with a smidgen of dustiness in the pan with a thinner texture overall, so I was particularly impressed with how easy it was to use (usually thin, matte powders go on unevenly). This shade wore well for eight hours on me.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,FANTASCENE,Palette," a new, limited edition palette filled with peach, coral, copper, and brown. I liked it, but I didn‚Äôt love it; the copper shade (Meet Ya) is much thicker in texture than the other shades, which I found made it harder to layer and blend into other shades, while the pink-coral (She Said) did not work well dry (or over primer‚Äìit had to be used wet).",B
SMASHBOX,DESERT ROSE,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark rosy copper with warm undertones and a matte, metallic finish. It was richly pigmented and yielded even, opaque coverage in a single layer. The liquid lipstick was thin but not watery with enough slip to spread across my lips without being too hard to control. This shade lasted well for six and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
SMASHBOX,IN BLOOM,Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with strong, warm undertones and a matte, metallic finish. The color payoff was opaque in a single layer, and the consistency was thin, non-clingy, and spreadable without being overly fluid, so it was easy to get even coverage and crisp edges. It dried down and set to a transfer-proof finish that was comfortable to wear. The color stayed on well for six and a half hours and was non-drying.",A
SMASHBOX,"XO, VLADA",Lipstick,"a medium-dark, rosy copper with warm undertones and a matte, metallic finish. It had good color coverage, though it needed a half of a layer m ore for truly opaque coverage. The texture was lightweight, smooth, and thin initially and then dried down to a transfer-proof finish that didn‚Äôt feel clingy. Usually, metallic finishes can emphasize my lip lines quite a bit but this did not exaggerate them. It wore well for six hours and was non-drying.",B
SMASHBOX,PRISMATIC PETAL,Highlighter,"a soft, medium copper base with a stronger, orange undertone with pink-to-violet shifting sparkle and pearl. It had larger sparkles in it, and I would consider it a more glittery highlighter so if that isn‚Äôt something you enjoy, then the finish won‚Äôt live up to expectations. The duochrome was noticeable in person; I definitely got hints of peachy-copper goodness that shifted to a cooler, fuchsia-pink sheen depending on how the light hit my cheeks. The highlighter had medium coverage, which was more buildable with respect to glow than color.",B-
SEPHORA,UNICORN DUST (361),Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, coppery plum with iridescent pink to blue shifting sparkle. The texture was denser and had more slip and silicone to it, so it adhered and built up better to the lid and had less fallout than expected based on how the swatch might looked. I would recommend applying this with a dampened brush, which helped to amplify the pigmentation-level to mostly opaque rather than semi-sheer coverage applied dry. It wore well for eight hours but had slight fallout over time.",C
SEPHORA,LUCKY PENNY (220),Eyeshadow,"a soft, peachy-orange with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a smooth, almost wet-feeling texture‚Äìdense and creamy but thin‚Äìand had slip, which helped the sparkles actually adhere on my lid and mix better with the base color. This shade stayed on well for eight hours with minimal fallout.",B+
SEPHORA,JUMP INTO THE MUD (340),Eyeshadow,"a darker, olive-brown with warm undertones gold sparkle. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a firmer, dense texture that worked better for the underlying base color but didn‚Äôt work well for picking up and applying the glitter. On me, the base color lasted for eight hours but there was some fallout over time due to the glitter.",C+
SEPHORA,SECRET GARDEN (363),Eyeshadow,"a dirty, blackened green with warm, brown undertones and flecks of green, teal, and copper sparkle. It had good coverage, but the resulting color was much warmer and more faded compared to how it appeared in the pan, which was somewhat expected given the amount of shimmer/sparkle in it. The texture was slightly dry to the touch and had a bit of fallout during application. It wore well for seven hours on me before fading noticeably.",B-
SMASHBOX,ROSEMANTIC,Highlighter,"a medium-dark copper with warm, orange undertones and a metallic sheen. It had opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly to my skin. The texture was dense but smooth to the touch, firm but not difficult to pickup nor to apply to my skin. The powder blended out nicely and did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me.",A-
SMASHBOX,ROSE MAGIC,Lipstick,"a dark, coppery-red with warm undertones and a fine, metallic shimmer-sheen finish and a moderate shine. The texture was smooth, medium in thickness but light-medium in weight, and rather tacky (which I find consistent with this formula). It had opaque color payoff that applied evenly across my lips and didn‚Äôt emphasize my lip lines. It wore well for five and a half hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A
SMASHBOX,"XO, VLADA",Lipstick,"a medium-dark copper with warm, brown undertones and a metallic sheen. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, while the color applied evenly on my lips without any streaking. The texture was smooth, moderately tacky, and medium in thickness but a touch of product gathered in my deeper lip lines, though it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance.. It stayed on well for five and a half hours and was moisturizing while worn.",A
SEPHORA,LOS CABOS,Bronzer,"a soft brown with warm, yellow undertones and a matte finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, but I found it easy enough to adjust my touch to pickup less product for more buildable coverage if preferred‚ÄìI love when powders are like this as they are much more versatile! The consistency felt smooth and velvety to the touch without being dusty or powdery. It applied easily to bare skin and blended out with little effort. This shade stayed on well for eight hours before fading a bit.",A
SMASHBOX,GILDED ROSE,Highlighter,"a soft, peachy gold with a pink iridescent sheen and a luminous finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. On my skin tone, it was more in the vein of ‚Äúmy skin but better,‚Äù as it added subtle warmth and noticeable shine with little color, though I caught the pinkish shift on occasion. The pink sheen was more pronounced when paired with cooler-toned blushes. The texture was moderately dense, smooth, and firm in the pan so there was no excess product kicked up, but the powder still blended out nicely on my skin. This shade lasted well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,HUDSON,Lipstick,"a light-medium pink with strong, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a milkier color and finish, so it looked almost evenly translucent. The texture had moderate slip and felt “wet” almost as it was quite creamy, and as a result, it did pull into my lip lines a bit. This shade stayed on well for three hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",B-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,LI,Lipstick,"a bright, medium fuchsia pink with subtle, warmer undertones and a fine, pearly sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips without tugging. The lipstick had a lightweight, lightly creamy consistency that was comfortable to apply and to wear and didn’t settle into my lip lines. It wore well for four and a half hours and was moisturizing while worn.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,ORI,Lipstick,"a medium pink with soft, warm undertones and a cream finish. The pigmentation was very nearly opaque in a single layer, while the lipstick had a creamy, smooth consistency that glided easily across my lips and applied fairly evenly. There was slight product that sat in my deeper lip lines, though it wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The color lasted for just over four hours on me and was lightly hydrating over time.",B+
WET 'N' WILD,WINTER BLOOM,Highlighter,"a bright, white gold with subtle, warm undertones paired with a luminous sheen. The pigmentation was semi-opaque and easily built up to full coverage, or one could use a slightly lighter hand to achieve sheerer, even more buildable coverage if desired. The highlighter had a smooth, denser consistency that wasn’t too firmly pressed in the pan, so it was still easy to pick up product using more feathery brushes. It applied well to my cheek bones, blended out nicely, and didn’t emphasize my skin’s natural texture. It stayed on well for eight hours on me before I noticed fading.",A-
URBAN DECAY,GOLDMINE,Eyeliner,"a medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and faint, gold micro-sparkle over a more metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque color payoff in a single stroke, which was buildable to mostly opaque coverage. The pencil had a waxier consistency, which meant that it glided on without skipping or dragging, but I found that it seemed like it was overly waxy and resulted in sheerer coverage. It wore well for eight hours on me.",B
URBAN DECAY,LUCKY,Eyeliner,"a deep, reddish brown with warm undertones and a metallic sheen with slight micro-sparkle. It had opaque pigmentation in one layer, while the texture was creamy enough not to tug and glide across my lid. The eyeliner stayed on well for nine and a half hours on me before thinning slightly.",A
SEPHORA,CHERRY MOON (94),Lipstick,"a rich, deep red with strong, cool blue undertones and a soft matte finish. I loved that the finish was still matte and transfer-proof like one would want out of this type of formula, but it had a softness to it that looked and felt comfortable on my lips. I wish this shade was more pigmented, though, but it was layerable to full coverage by adding a second coat after the initial layer had dried down. The texture was lightweight, thin but not watery, and it was easy to spread across my lips. This shade was still going strong after eight hours of wear and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
SEPHORA,CINDER ROSE (83),Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark mauve with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. The texture was smooth, fluid, and creamy and seemed slightly thicker than other shades in the range, and the dry down took a bit longer, though it set to a mostly transfer-proof finish within 30 seconds, but there was slight tackiness apparent when I pressed my lips together for the first half hour of wear. It had opaque color payoff that stayed on well for seven and a half hours on me. The formula felt neither drying nor hydrating over time.",A
MAC,"HEY, CORAL, HEY",Blush,"a medium, pink-coral with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had medium, buildable coverage–three layers to get opaque pigmentation–that applied fairly evenly to my skin. It didn’t take much effort to blend out, but it definitely needed some help after the initial lay down of color. The texture was soft, silky, and smooth without being too powdery or dusty on the skin. It wore well for eight hours on me but I noticed some darkening after six hours of wear.
",B+
URBAN DECAY,BEACHED,Palette,"six neutral-hued shades and two pops of blue. I liked the color scheme, though I found the actual shades and finishes more limiting than expected. I would have preferred if there had been a lighter, but quite metallic, shade instead of two mid-tone copper/bronze shades. The quality was good, and I think if you tend to like Urban Decay’s formula, you won’t find these lacking.",A-
MAC,PERFECTLY LIT,Highlighter,"a rich, medium-dark copper with strong, warm orange undertones and a metallic sheen. The powder was nearly opaque in a single layer and easily built-up to full coverage if preferred. It consisted of a soft copper, orange-copper, red-copper, and deeper orange-copper, so there wasn‚Äôt inherently a ton of variation in the overall tone and depth of the shade but on cooler complexions, some of that tonal difference between more orange compared to more pink/red may be more apparent.",A-
YVES SAINT LAURENT,CHASE ME NUDE,Lipgloss,"a soft, pinky-coral with faint gold pearl. It had medium coverage that applied fairly evenly and deepened my lip color a bit more than I anticipated based on the color it swatched. It applied fairly evenly but there was a touch of product that settled into my lip lines. The consistency felt watery initially but then felt a bit more balm-like within a few minutes and was minimally tacky. It lasted for two hours on me and was moderately hydrating.",B
YVES SAINT LAURENT,DEVOUR ME PLUM,Lipgloss,"a dark, reddish-plum with subtle, warm undertones and faint, lighter gold pearl. It had medium to semi-opaque pigmentation with a thin, watery texture that thickened slightly (and felt less cool/wet) to a thin, balm-like feel‚Äìmore slip and creaminess. The color went on more evenly and seemed to smooth out my lip lines overall. The gloss seemed to stain a little, though the wear was closer to three hours on me with respect to coverage and shine. It felt moderately moisturizing to me.",B+
YVES SAINT LAURENT,UNDRESS ME,Lipgloss,"a rich, medium orange with warm, red undertones and barley-there pearl. It had medium pigmentation, as described, but the color did not apply evenly and did not seem to self-level much, so the end result was slightly splotchy coverage that did gather in my lip lines somewhat. The texture felt watery when I initially applied it, but it ‚Äúset‚Äù to a slightly creamier, more balm-like consistency that did not feel as ‚Äúwet‚Äù on my lips. It wore well for three hours and left a faint stain behind, while the formula was moderately hydrating.",C+
URBAN DECAY,100 DEGREES,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pinky-coral with warm undertones and a glossy, shiny finish. It looked like a glossy balm and less like a lipstick in finish, but it had a slight tackiness for better adhesion (and more consistent with the Vice formula). The finish is ‚ÄúSheer,‚Äù which Urban Decay describes as a ‚Äúpunch of color with a sheer, shiny finish,‚Äù and I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs somewhat accurate‚Äì100 Degrees ran a bit more pigmented (more like medium to semi-opaque). The color applied smoothly to my lips and didn‚Äôt drag with fairly even application and minimal color that settled into my lip lines (which wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance). It wore well for four and a half hours and was nicely hydrating.",B+
URBAN DECAY,HEATWAVE,Lipstick," a rich, deep copper-brown with warm, red undertones and a metallic finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation with a lightweight, creamy texture that wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin but had enough substance to adhere well and yield rich coverage despite the shine. There was a smidgen of product that did get into my deeper lip lines, but the opacity and metallic sheen made it hard to see it from a normal viewing distance (just in the close-up photos). It lasted for five hours and was hydrating while worn.",A
COLOUR POP,MUCHO,Lipstick,"a rich, medium pinky-red with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. The color coverage was opaque in a single layer, while the consistency was lightweight, velvety, and smooth without being too thick or too thin. I had no trouble applying and spreading out the color on my lips for smooth, even application that stayed on well for over eight hours. It stained my lips and felt slightly drying after six and a half hours of wear.",A
COLOUR POP,GIFTED,Lipstick,"a deep berry with cool undertones and a satin finish. It had good pigmentation, though it wasn‚Äôt fully opaque in one layer. The consistency was smooth, lightweight, and thinner with less creaminess compared to most shades in the formula, though that didn‚Äôt lead to any issues with application or the actual wear. It wore down to a more matte finish a bit faster, but it was still going strong after eight hours of wear. This particular shade left a strong stain behind but was slightly drying after six hours of wear.",A-
MAC,FLIRTING WITH DANGER,Blush,"a medium-dark, coppery red with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had rich color coverage in a single layer‚Äìthough it was supposed to be sheer and buildable‚Äìwith a smooth, velvety texture that wasn‚Äôt too thin or too dense in the pan, so it didn‚Äôt have a lot of excess product kicked up in the pan but still blended out nicely. As I buffed and blended the color on my cheeks, it had a natural matte finish‚Äìnot flat or dry‚Äìthat stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me.",B+
COLOUR POP,C'MON SIS,Lipstick,"a medium, rosy plum with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation in a fluid stroke that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips. The texture was dense without being heavy or overly thick and had enough creaminess to glide on without tugging. It wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A
COLOUR POP,OOUUUU!,Lipstick,"a medium, tangerine orange with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had good color coverage that applied evenly, but the texture was prone to separating along my lip lines and looked slightly patchy after the initial application. The texture was lightweight and comfortable to wear, but there was continued settling into my lip lines over the four and a half hours it wore for. The formula felt lightly moisturizing while worn.",B
COLOUR POP,QUICKIE,Lipstick,"a medium peach with warmer undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, while the consistency was lightly creamy, smooth, and denser (but not thick or stiff to work with). There was a touch of color that gathered in my deeper lip lines, though it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The color stayed on well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",A-
COLOUR POP,COME UP,Lipstick,"a bright, medium coral with warm undertones and a satin sheen. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, spreadable texture that was balanced between thick and thin so it was easy to work with but didn‚Äôt settle into my lip lines. This particular shade was more smoothing and forgiving of my lip lines, too. On me, it wore well for seven and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating during that time.",A
COLOUR POP,FELIX,Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange with warm, yellowish undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was incredibly rich and opaque with less than one pull of product to achieve. It had a lightweight texture that wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin, and it spread easily across my lips for even coverage. This shade stayed on well for over eight hours and was a touch drying toward the end of wear.",A
COLOUR POP,FORTUNE FAVORS,Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium coral-red with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had good color coverage, though it wasn‚Äôt opaque, in a single layer. The texture was slightly runnier and more emollient compared to the average shade in the formula, which I felt made the application a little trickier as there was slight streaking along the edges that I couldn‚Äôt smooth out. The upside was the intensity of the actual color made the imperfections hard to see from a normal viewing distance. This shade lasted for over eight hours, stained my lips slightly, and felt a touch drying after six and a half hours of wear.",A-
GUERLAIN,#28,Lipstick,"a bright, medium red with warm, orange undertones and a subtle, pearl sheen. It had good color payoff in a single layer, though I could see my lip freckle peeking through. The texture was lightweight, thin without being clingy or uncomfortable, and had enough slip to glide across my lips without tugging. The color went on evenly and stayed on well for five and a half hours, while the formula felt hydrating.",A
GUERLAIN,#71,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark pink with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. The lipstick had a smooth, lightly creamy texture that glided easily across my lips and yielded even, mostly opaque color payoff in a single stroke. This shade wore well for five hours, stained my lips slightly, and was moisturizing over time.",A
HOURGLASS,RAVINE,Palette,"five shades of warm neutrals with a mix in finishes. Per the brand, the formula is supposed to have a ‚Äúvelvety-smooth texture‚Äù and a ‚Äúhigh concentration of pure pigment powder for the truest color payoff.‚Äù They‚Äôre an update to the brand‚Äôs previous Modernist eyeshadow palettes (which I didn‚Äôt like at all), and it‚Äôs a definite improvement! The colors are very true-to-brand, though it may feel redundant for those who have already indulged in their fair share of neutral palettes over the last few years.",A-
MAC,SHOW GOLD,Highlighter,"a light, yellowed-peach base with peach-to-pink shifting sparkle and pearl. It had a more sparkling, metallic finish than most of the brand‚Äôs Extra Dimension Skinfinishes, and you have to like a stronger, more intense highlighter to fall for this one, I think. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was buildable.",B
MAC,WHISPER OF GILT,Highlighter,"a bright, light-medium gold with warmer, peachy-gold undertones and a metallic sheen. It was richly pigmented and had a smooth, soft consistency that was easy to apply to my skin and blended out with almost no effort at all. I didn‚Äôt find it emphasized my skin‚Äôs natural texture at higher-coverage levels. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before it started to fade a bit.",A-
COLOUR POP,KISMET,Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium-dark orange-red with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. The color payoff was good, though just shy of full coverage, but a dab or so as needed to increase coverage worked just fine to get there. The texture was lightweight, smooth, and spreadable without being too thin or liquidy but yielded very slight streaking along the edges of my lips (but I couldn‚Äôt see that from a normal viewing distance). I noticed this shade had more of a noticeable ‚Äúdry down‚Äù compared to other shades, and this looked more matte within a few minutes whereas other shades take hours to wear down to a more matte finish. The color stayed on well for over eight hours and felt slightly drying on me after seven hours of wear.",A
COLOUR POP,SHE SAID,Lipstick,"a medium-dark plum with warm undertones and a satin finish. It was intensely pigmented with smooth, even, and opaque coverage in a single stroke. The consistency was lightweight, spreadable without being too runny, and easy to work with on my lips. The color was still going strong after eight hours of wear and felt mostly non-drying over time.",A
COLOUR POP,HI SUPPOSE,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark purple with warm, pink undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque in a single layer, but the texture could have been easier to work with as it seemed more prone to streaking along the edges without leveling as it dried down a bit. The consistency was smooth and spread well across my lips, though. When it ‚Äúset,‚Äù it was slightly tacky and a touch of color lifted away within the first 30 minutes if I wasn‚Äôt careful. It wore well for over eight hours on me and was a smidgen drying toward the end of that time period.",A-
DIOR,WARM SUNRISE (004),Bronzer,"a medium brown with warm, yellow undertones and a satin finish. The bronzer took on a natural finish‚Äìnot quite luminous but more than matte‚Äìwhen applied and blended out on my skin.",A
NARS,POISON ROSE,Palette,"a new, limited edition lip palette that features one lip balm and four powder lipsticks. Per the brand, the Lip Powder formula is supposed to be ‚Äúbuildable, blendable‚Äù and can be used ‚Äúwith our without balm‚Äù and ‚Äúworn alone or layered on lips‚Äù (per the press release). I recommend using the Lip Powders with the balm or some sort of creamy base, because they are, as one might expect, rather powdery and dry, so alone they tended to emphasize every single imperfection on my lips along with my lip lines and gave me a painfully tight (I could feel my lips protesting when I tried to smile in photos) lips as the formula clung and clung and clung. With the balm layered underneath or on top (I preferred on top for easier and more precise results), it was a lot more comfortable to wear and more forgiving on my lips.",B-
GUERLAIN,#65,Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with subtle, warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It had faint pearl (more so than most shades in the formula) as well. The consistency was smooth, lightly creamy, and comfortable to apply and to wear without being too slippery. It had opaque color payoff that wore well for five and a half hours. The formula felt hydrating over time and didn‚Äôt settle into my lip lines but actually made them less prominent.",A+
GUERLAIN,#73,Lipstick,"a bright, medium fuchsia pink with cool, bluish undertones and a natural sheen. It was richly pigmented with a lightweight, lightly creamy texture that glided across my lips without dragging but did not slide around too readily while worn. It lasted for five and a half hours, left a faint stain behind, and was moisturizing while worn.",A
COLOUR POP,DILLY-DALLY,Lipstick,"a medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, while the consistency was smooth, spreadable, and easy to work with for even coverage. It didn‚Äôt have a full, flat-matte kind of dry down, but it did ‚Äúset‚Äù to a transfer-resistant finish that had a touch of tackiness. The lipstick still looked quite good after seven hours of wear and was non-drying.",A
COLOUR POP,ASHER,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had good color payoff, though it was just shy of full coverage, with a smooth, mousse-like texture that was fairly easy to spread and distribute across my lips, but I couldn‚Äôt seem to avoid slight streaking in places. The color also settled into my deeper lip lines from the get-go, and it did worsen somewhat over time. This shade still looked mostly intact after eight hours of wear, while the formula was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",B+
COLOUR POP,FLUKE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark lavender with cooler undertones and a satin finish. The color payoff was fantastic with smooth, even coverage in a single layer. The liquid lipstick had a lightweight, liquid-mousse hybrid texture that spread easily across my lips but smoothed out most of my lip lines. It wore well for seven and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
KKW BEAUTY,SUPER NUDE,Lipgloss,"a light peach with warm undertones and barely-there flecks of gold. It had semi-sheer coverage, which was as expected based on the brand‚Äôs description of it being sheer with a very milky quality to its finish. The latter resulted in color that settled into lip lines (both vertical and horizontal ones for me), despite the actual gloss going on more evenly and didn‚Äôt have streaking along the edges. The texture felt smooth and was moderately tacky from what I could tell. It wore well for three hours but was lightly hydrating. There was no discernible scent or taste.",B-
KKW BEAUTY,JUICY,Lipgloss,"a medium, peachy-coral with warm undertones and fine pearl. The shimmer was hard to see applied, which I was surprised about, as I nearly thought it was just a cream finish after I had applied it for the first time! The texture was smooth, light-medium in thickness but lightweight, and moderately tacky. It had medium coverage (it was described as ‚Äúpale sheer nude‚Äù), but it gathered in every lip line I had, though the gloss itself went on without streaking. It lasted for three and a half hours and was lightly hydrating. There was no discernible scent or taste.",C+
FENTY BEAUTY,WHO NEEDS CLOTHES,Highlighter,"a light, rosy copper with lots of glitter and fine pearl. It had more glitter than Brown Sugar, so it had a stronger, more glittering effect on the skin with less product, but for some, it might be too glittery. The finish was noticeably dewy and shiny on the skin, though by how much really was dependent on how many pumps of product were applied and how much of the body they covered. The liquid consistency was smooth, gel-like, and easy to spread across my skin and had good, even glitter/shimmer dispersion.",B+
GUERLAIN,#41,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pinky-coral with warm undertones and a glossy, cream finish. The pigmentation was fantastic with opaque coverage in a single layer. It had a lightweight, lightly creamy texture with enough slip to feel comfortable and give it a nice shine, but it didn‚Äôt slide around when worn and seemed to make my lips appear smoother overall. It wore well for five hours and was hydrating over time.",A
GUERLAIN,#70,Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium-dark fuchsia pink with subtle, cool undertones and a luminous sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied fairly well to my lips‚ÄìI noticed very, very subtle areas where it did not seem to apply as strongly in close-up photos but didn‚Äôt notice it in person. The texture was lightweight, emollient without being too slippery, and comfortable to apply and to wear. This shade lasted for five hours and was moisturizing while worn.",A
FENTY BEAUTY,BROWN SUGAR,Highlighter," a medium, golden bronze with fine gold pearl and some larger, gold sparkles. It warmed up my skin slightly but did not truly darken‚Äìdefinitely more in the vein of enhancing warmth. The finish was moderately sparkly and had a noticeable sheen‚Äìdefinitely looked a little dewy and very luminous; this shade had more finer shimmer compared to Who Needs Clothes, which has more larger sparkle. A lot of the finish is in the application: how much one applies and how far and wide (or near and dear) it‚Äôs spread out. I found the product was easy to spread across a large area with a buffing brush or fingertips with excellent glitter/sparkle dispersion.",B+
BECCA COSMETICS,DREAMSICLE,Highlighter,"a brighter pop of light-medium orange with strong, warm yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. It was richly pigmented and a little went a long way. There was a definite yellowness coming through the shade (at least, applied to my skin tone) compared to the brand‚Äôs other gold and peach-based shades, though I expect that those who apply it very sheerly may not see much difference between this and strong golds/peaches.",A
COLOUR POP,SHE'S A BEACH BABE,Palette,"a new(ish by now), limited edition trio that features a lipgloss and two of the brand‚Äôs Ultra Blotted Lips. I really enjoyed the gloss on a personal level, since I like shimmery, high-shine glosses that go with most things, and while not perfect, the Ultra Blotted Lips formula is interesting and I can see why some really adore it over typical liquid matte lipstick formulations. These shades can be purchased individually for those who only like one or two of the shades!",B+
NARS,MOON ORCHID,Lipstick,"a soft pink with cooler undertones and a soft shine. It had a milkier quality to it, and there was noticeable color that slipped into my lip lines from the get-go (and continued to worsen as time went on). It had semi-sheer coverage (as expected based on the brand‚Äôs description) that covered fairly evenly in a single layer. The consistency was lightly emollient but adhered well to my lips and did not feel slippery while worn. The formula was neither drying nor hydrating, while the color itself lasted for two and a half hours on me.",C-
NARS,VOODOO LILY,Lipstick,"a muted, light-medium rosy mauve with warm undertones and a glossy finish. It had sheer coverage (as intended), and on my natural lip color, it lightened it more than anything else, so I expect it to look quite different from person to person. It had a lightweight, lightly emollient texture that glided across my lips without tugging but did not feel overly slippery during wear. This shade wore well for two and a half hours and felt neither drying nor hydrating on me.",B+
NARS,WILD FLOWER,Lipstick,"a deep purple with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had medium color payoff, which did not build up well, and it seemed to settle into lip lines while also bunching up in places and looked almost grainy on my lips at times. The lipstick was lightweight, thin without being clingy, and had enough slip not to drag when applied. It wore well for four and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating, though the color settled further into my lip lines over time.",D+
NARS,WILD PHOX,Highlighter,"a pale lavender with cooler undertones and a pearly sheen. It‚Äôs supposed to be a highlighter that works for ‚Äúeyes, cheeks and face‚Äù for ‚Äúfresh-faced radiance.‚Äù It sounded like it was designed to have sheerer coverage based on ‚Äúhow to use‚Äù information provided by the brand.",A-
GIORGIO ARMANI,DAY (31),Eyeshadow,"a pale white with silver and white sparkle and flecks of glitter. It had sheer coverage and seemed to have less chunky glitter compared to other shades, so it wasn‚Äôt as unforgiving on the lid when layered, though I wouldn‚Äôt want to layer it as it did still have a clumpier, more textured finish to it. It had a more watery texture, which I expected based on past experience with the formula, that dried down quickly enough that I could diffuse it as a sheer wash and have it set before settling into my creases and fine lines. On its own, it wore well for nine hours before there was noticeable fallout.",F
GIORGIO ARMANI,BLUE REFLECTION (32),Eyeshadow," soft lavender with chunky glitter. It had sheer coverage that applied somewhat evenly, but the myriad of particle sizes made it appear somewhat clumpy and uneven in practice. It did not want to be layered, as it only worsened the unevenness in texture and made it more prone to flaking off during wear. As a single, sheer layer product on the lid, the color stayed on well for nine hours before there was slight fallout over time (not 16-hour wear as claimed), though the glitter would flake off if I rubbed my eyes moderately (not a surprise but wanted to put that warning out there!).",F
GIORGIO ARMANI,ROSE REFLECTION (33),Eyeshadow,"a light-medium pink with warm undertones and flecks of gold pearl and larger glitter. It had sheer coverage in a single layer, but it wasn‚Äôt buildable as promised, as additional layers resulted in patchy, clumpy, and uneven coverage and physical texture as the product thickened and felt heavier on my lid with more than one layer (three layers was uncomfortable!). The consistency was watery and worked easily for an all-over wash of product as it dried down quickly but not much more than that. It wore well for nine hours before it started to have noticeable fallout.",F
GIORGIO ARMANI,COPPER REFLECTION (34),Eyeshadow,"a medium copper with warm, orange-brown undertones and fine copper sparkle along with bigger flecks of glitter. It had sheer coverage, as promised, but I couldn‚Äôt build up the color well as the consistency had a tendency to thicken, go on unevenly, and clump up, which made my lid look very wrinkled and felt clingy on my actual lid. The watery texture made it work well as an all-over, sheer wash of shimmer when applied with a fingertip or dabbed on top of another eyeshadow but was hard to use in any other way. It lasted for nine hours before it started to have some fallout.",F
GIORGIO ARMANI,JADE REFLECTION (35),Eyeshadow,"a soft, sky blue with subtle, cool undertones and golden pearl and larger flecks of glitter. It had sheer coverage, which was as expected, but it did not have the ability to be layered well, so it fell rather short of the actual utility and functionality of the product based on how they were intended to be used. The texture was very watery, which was consistent with the range, and worked best as an all-over wash of shimmer rather than a really high-impact, glittery eyeshadow. On its own, the eyeshadow stayed on well for nine hours before starting to have some fallout.",F
NARS,NIGHT GARDEN,Palette,"a new, limited edition six-pan eyeshadow palette with a smoky set of shades. It was decent, but it definitely need a good eyeshadow primer underneath to maximize pigmentation, blendability, and help extend wear. The color combination definitely gives me ‚Äúnight garden‚Äù vibes, though I wish the deep brown (Fauna) wasn‚Äôt quite as dark (it was too close to Matira from a functional perspective).",B+
GUERLAIN,#21,Lipstick,"a bright, pinky-red with cool undertones and a cream finish. It was richly pigmented with a creamy, smooth consistency that glided across my lips easily. The texture was lightweight, thin without being clingy, and comfortable to wear. The color lasted well for almost six hours on me and was hydrating over time.",A+
GUERLAIN,#22,Lipstick,"a soft, medium red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a lightly glossy, cream finish. It had nearly opaque color payoff in a single layer, which applied evenly and never tugged on my lips. The lipstick had a smooth, lightly emollient consistency that wasn‚Äôt too creamy nor too dense, so it managed to smooth out my lip lines while still adhering well to them. It wore well for five hours on me and was moisturizing while worn.",A
COLOUR POP,ON THE RISE,Eyeshadow,"a medium purple with warm undertones and a soft, pearly sheen. The pigmentation was nearly opaque, while the texture was just a smidgen on the dry side, but otherwise, it was easy to work with and remained blendable on my lid. This shade wore well for seven and a half hours on me before fading noticeably.",B
COLOUR POP,PROWLIN',Eyeshadow,"a bright, pale lavender with warm, pink undertones and a golden, metallic sheen. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, almost cream-like texture that was blendable and easy to apply to bare skin. The eyeshadow stayed on well for eight hours on me before I noticed any fading.",A
COLOUR POP,TWO TO MANGO,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium lavender with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly over bare skin, though a primer definitely gave it that extra oomph. The texture was soft, velvety, and not too thin or too firmly pressed in the pan, so it blended out nicely but did not sheer out immediately. It wore well for just over eight hours on me.",A-
COLOUR POP,HOWLIN',Eyeshadow,"a light-medium lavender with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a soft, lightly dusty texture that was fairly blendable and didn‚Äôt sheer out too readily when applied. I would recommend patting it over primer, which helped improve the payoff. It lasted for seven and a half hours on me.",B
COLOUR POP,FEATHERED,Eyeshadow,"a medium brown with warm, reddish undertones and flecks of sparkle over a matte finish. The pigmentation was fantastic, while the consistency was soft, smooth, and velvety without being too powdery or too firmly pressed in the pan. The eyeshadow was easy to work with and wore well for eight hours.",A-
COLOUR POP,BURNER,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark plum with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had opaque color payoff that applied evenly and smoothly on my lid. The texture was soft to the touch, dense without being stiff or thick, and blendable. This shade lasted for eight hours on me.",A
MAC,PRIMAPANDA,Palette,Every single product in the palette fell below what one would look for in a mid-end product with two shades being absolutely atrocious. Eyeshadow primer did not alleviate the overall application issues and only improved wear by a few hours but by no means long enough to make it through even an eight-hour day.,F
GUERLAIN,#02,Lipstick,"a light-medium pink with strong, warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It had nearly opaque color payoff that applied smoothly and evenly across my lips without tugging. The texture was lightweight, thin without being clingy, and lightly emollient so it felt comfortable to wear and had some shine, but it did not slide around while worn. There was a faint amount of product that settled into my deeper lip lines, though it wasn‚Äôt apparent from a normal viewing distance. The lipstick lasted well for five hours on me and was hydrating while worn.",A
GUERLAIN,#03,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, red-plum with warm undertones and a cream finish. The texture was smooth, lightly creamy with enough slip to glide on easily but not feel slippery when worn. It had opaque color payoff that went on evenly and smoothly without emphasizing my lip lines. It wore well for five hours and was nicely moisturizing over time.",A+
MAC,GLEAMER,Highlighter,"a very pale pink with warm undertones and a satin sheen. The finish was subtle on the skin and more of a natural sheen than an overt shimmer finish. Per the brand, it‚Äôs supposed to be a ‚Äúvelvety face powder with silky sheer colour‚Äù that is ‚Äúblendable‚Äù and can be a subtle ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù or ‚Äúeven out skin‚Äù when used swirled (which is really the only way to use if one is using a blush or highlighting brush).",B-
MAC,GALACTIC MINT,Lipstick,"a light, bluish-aqua with cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which was somewhat buildable, but it had a chalkier texture and look so every imperfection was obvious and the lipstick finish was unforgiving. The color pulled away at every lip line, sunk into my lip lines, and wore away unevenly over three and a half hours of time. The formula was non-drying.",C-
MAC,NICO KISS,Lipstick,"a deep navy blue with strong, cool undertones and a satin finish. It was definitely not matte until the shine wore down after a couple of hours of wear. The texture was lightweight, thin but not clingy, and moderately emollient so it didn‚Äôt tug on the lips. It had fairly good pigmentation as it combatted some of the additional slip and helped it apply more evenly than I expected, though it still had room for improvement. It wore well for five hours, left a purplish stain behind, and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
MAC,KAWAII PARTY,Lipstick,"a medium lavender with warm, pink undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque in a single layer, while the texture was dense without being heavy or thick, firm but still had enough glide that it did not tug during application. The color seemed to sit in my lip lines just slightly, which worsened as it wore but not too noticeably in person. It wore well for five hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
COLOUR POP,LA PLAYA,Eyeshadow,"a very soft green with warm, yellow undertones and a frosted sheen. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, while the consistency was soft, smooth, and blendable without being too softly pressed in the pan. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.",A
COLOUR POP,SLAY-FARER,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, bluish-teal with a metallic sheen. The eyeshadow was richly pigmented with a smooth, lightly creamy texture that had a great press that was easy to work with‚Äìnot too soft nor too firm‚Äìso the eyesahdow applied well to bare skin and stayed on nicely for eight hours before fading.",A
COLOUR POP,FORMATION,Eyeshadow,"a medium, blue-teal with cool undertones and a matte finish. The pigmentation was fantastic with a smooth, velvety texture that was just a touch powdery in the pan, but it applied evenly on bare skin and blended out with ease. This shade lasted well for eight and a half hours on me.",A
COLOUR POP,BACKSTAGE,Eyeshadow,"a vibrant, medium blue with strong, cool undertones and a mostly matte finish. It was the type of matte finish that had barely-there pearl strewn throughout that seems to, in my experience, aid in blendability but is not prevalent enough to take away from the matte finish to the eye. The texture was soft without being too powdery or too firmly pressed in the pan. It had opaque pigmentation that stayed on well for eight hours on me.",A-
COLOUR POP,BASSLINE,Eyeshadow,"a soft, pale blue with cool and ‚Äúwarm‚Äù blue shimmer that gave it a metallic finish. It had medium coverage that was buildable but opaque coverage was best achieved by using it with a dampened brush. The texture was smooth to the touch, blendable, and easy enough to work with. It lasted for eight hours on me.",B+
COLOUR POP,FAULT LINE,Eyeshadow,"a medium purple with subtle, warm undertones and cooler, violet pearl for a frosted finish. It had good color coverage in a single layer, though the texture seemed to have a bit too much slip to the point where it did not apply as smoothly or as evenly initially as a lot of other shimmery shades have done in the past for me. With some blending, it came together, though. This shade wore well for eight hours on me.",B
URBAN DECAY,SIN,Palette,"a new, limited edition six-pan cheek palette that includes three blushes and three highlighters. Within the palette, there are three shades that are new (Kiss Off, PSA, and Spotlight) are new and the other three are from the brand‚Äôs permanent range. I find that Urban Decay‚Äôs cheek products tend to be quite pigmented, though they are supposed to be sheerer and more buildable, so as long as one is comfortable with more pigmented cheek products and has need for the shades in this palette, I could see it working out well.",A-
GUERLAIN,#999,Lipstick,"a translucent, white and silver glittery top coat with a glossy finish. It is listed as a top coat shade (though it can also be worn alone), so the lack of coverage wasn‚Äôt unexpected. There was a subtle white base that gave my lips a lighter color, and I could see that the milky quality of the base pulled into my lip lines. It felt fairly smooth in the tube with minimal noticeable texture from the sparkle on my lips as well, which was nice. It did not wear very long‚Äìtwo and a half hours‚Äìbut was moisturizing.",B-
GUERLAIN,#777,Lipstick,"a light-medium, yellow gold with warm gold micro-sparkle and a yellow-tinted base. It is listed as a top coat shade (though it can also be worn alone), so the lack of coverage wasn‚Äôt unexpected. I wish there was less of a base color and more sparkle, as I felt that the yellowish base was somewhat streaky and rather prone to pulling into my lip lines (which I find very uncharacteristic of a Rouge G). There was good, even dispersion of the shimmer, and I did not feel any grittiness in the tube durin gapplication, but I could feel a very subtle texture on my lips while worn. It lasted for three and a half hours on me and was somewhat hydrating.",C+
GIORGIO ARMANI,MILANO NUDE (511),Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark coral with warm, brownish tones and a glossy finish. It had medium, buildable coverage (up to semi-opaque) that applied fairly evenly, but it did not look as smooth nor as flattering on my lips as most of the Ecstasy Lacquers have. I think it may have had to do with the fact that this shade was thinner and did not develop to the more gel-like texture after initial application that the others have in my experience. It wore well for five hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
GIORGIO ARMANI,ADRENALINE (600),Lipgloss,"a deep, reddish berry with flecks of purple and violet pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation (the formula is designed to be buildable) with a very deep stain and a lightly glossy finish. The texture was lightweight, smoothing of my lip lines, and comfortable to apply and wear; though initially it had a more watery feel, it developed to a more gel-like consistency that was lightly tacky as it wore. It stayed on well for over six hours with a strong stain left behind. The formula felt lightly hydrating over time.",A
PRETTY VULGAR,SPARKLING SASS,Highlighter,"a medium gold with warm, orange undertones and a metallic sheen. The texture was incredibly soft and finely-milled with a velvety feel that bordered on cream-like. It had opaque color payoff that applied well to bare skin with even, smooth coverage that blended out with little effort. It stopped just short of emphasizing my skin‚Äôs natural texture, but I could see it potentially doing so on more textured skin. This shade stayed on well for nine hours before I noticed any fading.",A+
COLOUR POP,CUTOFFS,Eyeshadow,"a soft, peachy-pink with a cooler, pink iridescent sheen. The color payoff was good, just shy of full coverage, with a soft, smooth, and lightly creamy texture that was a little thinner and had more slip than most shades in the range have had. The eyeshadow started to fade on me after eight hours of wear.",A-
COLOUR POP,KILL SWITCH,Eyeshadow,"a medium brown with warm undertones and flecks of gold sparkle. It had excellent pigmentation with a soft, lightly powdery texture that had good substance, so it stayed nicely pigmented even on bare skin but was still blendable along the edges. It wore well for eight hours on me.",A-
COLOUR POP,20 SOMETHING,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium copper with warm, orange undertones and a glittery, metallic finish. The texture was chunkier and denser with a lot of larger glitter particles. It was the type of product that applied better with fingertips or a dampened brush, as it didn‚Äôt go on as evenly or as smoothly with a fluffier brush in my experience. The eyeshadow stayed on well for eight hours but had slight fallout over time.",B
COLOUR POP,NIGHT SHOW,Eyeshadow,"a deep gold with warm undertones and a metallic finish. The eyeshadow had a very soft, lightly creamy and lightly pressed consistency, so I actually felt like less was more when it came to application as it was quite pigmented and easy to over-apply due to the texture. It lasted for eight and a half hours before fading on me.",A-
COLOUR POP,RASCAL,Eyeshadow," a bright, medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. The pigmentation was nearly opaque in a single layer, while the texture was softly pressed and very blendable on my lid. It was easy to pickup more product than necessary (which could result in fallout), so I would recommend using a lighter hand or a flat/stiff brush when using this shade. It wore well for eight hours on me.",B+
COLOUR POP,DEJA BOO,Eyeshadow,"a bright, light chartreuse with a very strong, yellow leaning paired with a pearl finish. The color payoff was fantastic with opaque coverage that applied evenly and smoothly on my lid. The texture was soft, blendable, and not at all powdery nor was it too firmly pressed in the pan. It stayed on well for eight hours before fading a bit.",A
GIORGIO ARMANI,LUCE (101),Lipgloss,"a light-medium peach with warm undertones and golden pearl. It is a new shade for spring, and it was described as having ‚Äúits pigment levels ‚Ä¶ reduced‚Äù with the addition of ‚Äúmother-of-pearl.‚Äù It had semi-sheer coverage with a healthy helping of shimmer and a ridiculous amount of shine. The texture was lightweight, almost watery initially, and was easy to spread across my lips. It developed into a more gel-like, plusher consistency within a few minutes of wear (which was when I took photos). It wore well for six and a half hours, was lightly hydrating, and was comfortable to wear. The longwear was what set this type of gloss apart from others like it.",A+
GIORGIO ARMANI,TANGERINE (300),Lipgloss,"a bright, medium orange-red with warm undertones and a glossy finish. It had medium pigmentation and looked and performed a lot like a stain would with respect to coverage. There was an even layer of translucency that gave it a glossy, stained glass kind of appearance. The texture was watery initially but developed to a gel-like, plush consistency that became lightly tacky after a few hours of wear. There was a smidgen of product that sat in my deeper lip lines, but the effect was smoothing of my finer lip lines overall. This shade lasted for six hours, left a stain behind, and was lightly moisturizing.",A
GIORGIO ARMANI,PINK-OUT (504),Lipgloss,"a rich, medium-dark red-plum with warm undertones and multi-colored pearl. The gloss has a water-like consistency initially that then develops to a more gel-like, plush texture that adheres smoothly and wears for an exceptionally long time. It had good color payoff, though it was actually designed to have more buildable coverage, but if you‚Äôre someone who prefers more pigmented gloss, then it will be right up your alley. It wore well for seven hours, was lightly hydrating, and comfortable to wear overall.",A
PERSONA,DEL MAR,Highlighter,"a medium copper with warm, golden shimmer and a frosted finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The powder felt a bit too dense and was stiffer in the pan, and the product had some dryness as I worked with it on my skin. It took a heavier hand to buff and blend out the highlighter onto my cheekbones for even, smooth coverage. I didn‚Äôt feel that it emphasized my skin‚Äôs texture, but the shimmer size seemed to be more distinctive in this shade compared to the other two hues (which seemed shinier in finish). This shade lasted for eight hours on me before fading a bit.",C+
MAC,SUGAR COAT,Lipgloss,"a clear base with iridescent pink and silver sparkle. It was described as a ‚Äúclear coat,‚Äù which was apt, as this was really just a translucent gloss with a moderate amount of shimmer and sparkle. The texture was smooth, moderately tacky, and comfortable to wear as the sparkle spread evenly across my lips. Despite it having a nearly-clear base, there was some milky color that pulled into my lip lines so I‚Äôd say it was very sheer rather than truly clear. It wore well for three and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing.",B+
MAC,GLITTER PARADE,Lipgloss,"a pale lavender with subtle, cool undertones and flecks of pink, gold, and silver sparkle. It had sheer coverage with a milky quality, but it didn‚Äôt seem to sit in my lip lines very much (and definitely wasn‚Äôt apparent at a normal viewing distance!). MAC did not describe this one as sheer, so it was significantly under-pigmented relative to the description of ‚Äúhigh coverage‚Äù for Lipglass. The gloss lasted for four hours and was lightly hydrating.",C
MAC,PANDA KISS,Lipgloss,"a medium pink with warm undertones and multi-colored sparkle. It had semi-sheer coverage and went on evenly, while the plusher texture made my lips look rather smooth and plumper from the shine. There was moderate tackiness, so it lasted a solid four hours and was also moisturizing over time.",B+
MAC,DREAMZ,Lipgloss,"a muted, navy blue with flecks of lighter blue and pink sparkle. It had semi-sheer coverage, and while it didn‚Äôt apply as terribly as I expected, it was by no means even in application and sat in every single lip line I had in any and every directly. The texture was lightweight but on the thicker side with a moderately tacky feel. It lasted for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",D+
MAC,ME SO FLEEK,Palette,"an eyeshadow quad, blush duo, lipstick, and lipgloss‚Äìand everything is full-sized, so it‚Äôs actually a great value set if you happen to like the shades included. Based on the last price I have for a blush duo, I‚Äôm getting a value of $95.50. I felt like the blush was particularly lovely, while the lip products were as expected for MAC‚Äôs finishes, and the quad was decent (which is probably better than average for MAC!).",B+
GIORGIO ARMANI,DRAMA BERRY (510),Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark berry-red with subtle, cool pink undertones and flecks of pink and red pearl and shimmer. It had very nearly opaque color coverage‚Äìthe shadow of my lip freckle came through slightly‚Äìwith a smooth, even application and laydown of color. The texture was smooth, lightweight, and velvety with the slip of a silicone primer. It adhered well to lips with a slight clinginess‚Äìin the best of ways‚Äìand lasted for almost eight hours on me. The formula lightly hydrating and comfortable to wear.",A
GIORGIO ARMANI,SHOCKING PINK (511),Lipstick,"a bright, cotton candy pink with cool, blue undertones and fine pearl. The texture was smooth and velvety with that silicone-like grip and feel of the formula (a bit like a silicone-based primer but creamier), so it lasted well, but the way this shade applied wasn‚Äôt as even as I expected and seemed to pull away around my bottom lip lines a bit. It had semi-opaque coverage that stayed on well for six hours. The formula felt lightly hydrating overall.",B-
URBAN DECAY,OUTSPOKEN,Lipstick,"a brighter, medium plum with warm undertones and a metallic finish. It had opaque color payoff in a single layer that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips without skipping. The lipstick had faint micro-sparkle, which I could feel when I initially applied it, though I would not say it was rough or gritty. Otherwise, it had enough slip to be comfortable to wear but still adhere well to my lips. It wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A
COLOUR POP,BPM,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark copper with warm, orange undertones and a frosted sheen. It had good pigmentation with a soft, smooth consistency that wasn‚Äôt too firmly nor too softly pressed in the pan, which made it easy to pickup, to apply, and to blend out. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.",A-
COLOUR POP,HOP ON,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium red with subtle warm undertones and a matte finish. It had rich pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly to the skin. The texture was slightly thinner and drier to the touch, but I didn‚Äôt have any issues diffusing or blending out the color in practice. Worth noting, it is a Pressed Pigment and therefore comes with the warning that it is not intended for use on the eye area. It stayed on well for eight and a half hours before there was slight fading.",A-
COLOUR POP,BRATTY,Eyeshadow,"a bright, tangerine orange with warm, orange and yellow undertones and a mostly matte finish. It seemed matte in the pan, but I swear I detected very, very faint pearl strewn through it when I swatched it. The eyeshadow was richly pigmented with a velvety smooth texture that wasn‚Äôt too powdery and had enough substance to it that it did not sheer away too readily. It lasted for eight hours on me.",A-
COLOUR POP,CHAUFFEUR,Eyeshadow,"a bright, light-medium tangerine orange with warm, yellow undertones and a golden, metallic sheen. The color payoff was opaque, while the eyeshadow had a smooth, lightly creamy texture that was easy to work with on the lid. It stayed on well for eight and a half hours.",A
COLOUR POP,COMEBACK KID,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium, peachy-pink with warm undertones and a golden sheen. The eyeshadow had good pigmentation, though not quite opaque in one layer. The consistency was smooth, soft and a little more loosely-pressed in the pan compared to other shades. It applied best by patting and pressing on as a result. The color wore well for eight hours on me.",B+
COLOUR POP,LAY LOW,Eyeshadow,"a medium coral with strong, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. There was very fine (and only a faint amount) shimmer that seemed to improve the texture and blendability while still leaving behind a mostly matte finish to the eye in person. It had opaque pigmentation in a single layer, blended out nicely, and stayed on for eight hours before it started to fade on me.",A
NARS,XENON,Lipgloss,"a soft, rosy mauve with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had good color payoff in one layer, though it wasn‚Äôt quite opaque. The texture was lightweight, smooth, and gel-like‚Äìplush but not thick or heavy‚Äìand very comfortable to wear. The color was easy to apply evenly, didn‚Äôt emphasize my lip lines, and stayed on nicely for four and a half hours. The formula was moisturizing while worn from what I could tell.",A-
NARS,PARADISE GARAGE,Lipgloss,"a soft, medium mauve with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. The pigmentation was fantastic with opaque coverage in a single layer. The gloss felt smooth and plush without being tacky, and it sat exceptionally well on my lips and didn‚Äôt emphasize my lip lines. The product wore well for five hours and was hydrating while worn.",A
NARS,MARS,Lipgloss,"a plummy brown with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had good color coverage, though not quite opaque, that went on evenly and smoothly across my lips. The texture was plush, gel-like, and non-tacky, and it did a good job of smoothing over my lip lines, too. This shade lasted well for five hours and was hydrating.",A
URBAN DECAY,BESO,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark, rosy plum with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. The pigmentation was good, though definitely not opaque in one layer. The consistency was lightweight, smoothing, and comfortable to wear as it felt plusher and more gel-like without being sticky. This shade stayed on well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating while worn.",A
URBAN DECAY,SNITCH,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium pink-coral with a cream finish. It had good color payoff, but the gloss did not apply evenly and I could see slight streaking along the edges or if I pressed my lips together, a slight line would be visible. It did not emphasize my lip lines, which was nice, though. The texture was lightweight, smooth, and gel-like with very minimal tackiness. It wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing.",B
URBAN DECAY,BANG,Lipgloss,"a medium red with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that did not apply that evenly, and it did sit in my lip lines a bit (particularly compared to other shades in the formula). The texture seemed slightly thinner and not as plush, though it was still more gel-like and did not feel tacky. It lasted for five hours and was lightly hydrating.",B-
GUERLAIN,#888,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark fuchsia pink with strong, cool undertones and iridescent violet pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in a single layer with a smooth, lightweight texture that was emollient and lightly creamy so it glided across my lips without tugging. The texture was smoothing and comfortable to wear as the formula kept my lips hydrated over the six hours this shade wore well for. There was a faint stain left behind. It was listed as a top coat shade (though it can also be worn alone), so less intense coverage was expected, but this was rather pigmented.",A-
GUERLAIN,#111,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, emerald green with subtle, warm undertones and cooler, finer green pearl paired with a luminous sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable coverage (not up to fully opaque, though) with a lightweight, smooth consistency that had moderate slip but didn‚Äôt feel slippery on my lips. There was a touch of tackiness‚Äìenough to adhere well to the lips but not enough to feel truly sticky on. The texture made the lip color comfortable to apply and to wear, but it did not apply as evenly as it should have. It wore well for five hours and stained my lips very slightly. The formula was nicely hydrating over time.",B
PERSONA,ZUMA,Highlighter,"a light-medium, peachy gold with warm undertones and a metallic finish. It was intensely pigmented with a smooth, creamy texture that felt denser and velvety to the touch, but it wasn‚Äôt too stiff to pickup easily with highlighting brushes. (The downside was the pigmentation‚Äìit was opaque, not really buildable without using a very light hand or less-dense tool.. true of most pigmented products.) The highlighter applied easily onto my skin with great blendability. This shade had the strongest sheen on my cheekbones, but it didn‚Äôt emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. It wore well for eight hours on me before it started to fade.",B+
TOO FACED,MELTED CLOVER,Lipstick,"a slightly bright, medium-dark pink with cool undertones and a flat, matte finish. It had opaque pigmentation that covered the lips evenly and smoothly without streaking. The consistency was lightweight, fluid without being watery or runny, and easy to work with. The dry down, however, was where the product went awry, as this clung as it dried down and set, which emphasized my lip lines and appeared ‚Äúcracked‚Äù in places. It wore away unevenly over a six-hour period and was somewhat drying over time.",B-
PERSONA,LAGUNA,Highlighter,"a pale, white gold with warm, yellow undertones and flecks of gold micro-sparkle that yielded a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a soft, smooth consistency that wasn‚Äôt too firmly nor too softly pressed in the pan, though I‚Äôd describe it as a denser formula with moderate slip (and there was silicone in it). The powder applied easily onto my skin, blended out well, and stayed on nicely for eight hours.",B+
COLOUR POP,NEW THEORY,Palette,"a six-piece set of slim lipsticks across three finishes (Matte, Creme, and Matte X). It‚Äôs a solid set of lipsticks ranging from peachy-brown to rich, warm red. I liked the variety, and the quality was good overall‚Äìpigmented, long-wearing, and even application.",A
COLOUR POP,LIFTED,Eyeshadow,"a medium pink with strong, warm undertones and a pearl-to-metallic finish. Applied dry, it had sheer coverage that had a lot of fallout during application unless patted over a tacky base. The texture was incredibly finely-milled and silky to the touch, so it was quite blendable, but it really needed to be applied using a dampened brush, where the coverage was opaque, application was even and had minimal fallout, and the entire product came into its own. I just wouldn‚Äôt bother with this formula if dry application was the primary use. I think you can top off or build up application with slightly dry product, but it really calls for wet/damp application to work well. On its own, it lasted for six hours dry and eight hours when applied wet.",C+
COLOUR POP,MULHOLLAND,Eyeshadow,"a medium, golden bronze with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. Applied in thin layers, I could achieve more opaque coverage when I built it up using it dry, but again, I highly recommend applying the product using a dampened brush, which yielded opaque, smooth color payoff in a single layer and had little fallout during application. The loose eyeshadow wore well for seven hours applied dry and nine hours applied wet.",B
COLOUR POP,TYPHOON,Eyeshadow,"a pale beige with warm undertones and silver and blue glitter. It had good pigmentation dry and damp actually, but the glitter adhered better and more evenly when used with a dampened brush. The consistency was velvety and finely-milled, and it was easy to blend out on my lid. There was some fallout during wear, though, particularly when applied dry (six hours) compared to dampened application (eight hours).",B-
COLOUR POP,HONEYPOT,Eyeshadow,"a light silver with subtle, cool undertones and a metallic finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff applied dry, which made it one of the more pigmented shades for dry application, but it did intensify to opaque coverage and had a much shinier finish when used with a dampened brush. The dampened application was definitely preferred to minimize fallout, increase coverage, and even made wear time better (from seven to eight hours).",B
SEPHORA,DEEP WATER BAY (24),Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark orange with warm, red undertones and a glossy, cream finish. The color payoff was fantastic, while the color applied evenly across my lips and helped to smooth out my lip lines. It had a lightly creamy consistency with moderate slip, but it adhered well to my lips within a few minutes and did not slide around too easily while worn. The lipstick wore well for five and a half hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",A+
SEPHORA,FIRST CLASS (25),Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange with warm, red undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque, but the texture seemed to separate on my lips, so it made it appear less pigmented, particularly around lip lines and any natural texture on my lips. The consistency was smooth and lightly creamy (so I did not expect any issues), so I‚Äôm not sure what caused the product to break away along my lip lines, but it did it every time I tried it (four times). It stayed on for five hours, left a stain behind, but it further settled into my lip lines over time. The formula felt neither drying nor hydrating to me.",B-
SEPHORA,ALL WASHED UP (26),Lipstick,"a bright, medium pinky-red with cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good color coverage that applied evenly across my lips. The consistency was thinner, smooth, and just had enough slip to glide on without tugging, but it was less emollient and thinner than most shades in the range. The color wore down to a true matte finish within two hours ofw ear. It lasted for six hours, left a stain behind, and was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",A-
TOO FACED,SUN BUNNY,Bronzer,"a new, updated version of the brand‚Äôs long-time favorite bronzing duo. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve properly owned it as a standalone product but have seen it in many palettes over the years‚Ä¶ I actually feel like the new packaging is a massive upgrade‚Äìsleek, keeps with the brand‚Äôs aesthetic, and is functional. Per the brand, both shades are ‚Äúbuildable for a customized glow‚Äù for a ‚Äúluminous, sun-kissed finish.‚Äù",B+
COLOUR POP,FELICITY,Highlighter,"a soft, translucent peach with a glittery mix of pink, gold, and copper. It has a glitter finish, which has larger particle sparkle/shimmer and a sheer base (more coverage in terms of shimmer/sparkle). The texturew was soft and spongy to the touch with moderate slip that it felt a little ‚Äúwet,‚Äù but as soon as I started to pat it onto my cheeks, it felt more like a powder than a cream.",A-
PRETTY VULGAR,LILAC LUST,Highlighter,"a bright, medium lavender with strong, warm pink undertones and an iridescent bluish-violet, metallic sheen. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, and it was the type of pigmentation where a little went a long way. Luckily, the powder was smooth, cream-like, and blendable, so it was easy to diffuse and blend out the edges or simply to use a lighter hand to get less product for sheerer coverage if preferred. At semi-opaque or greater coverage, it seemed to emphasize my skin texture slightly. It wore well for nine hours on me.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,TFX14,Eyeshadow,"a rich, molten gold with strong, warm yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. The eyeshadow was moderately dense and had noticeable slip (felt like a silicone primer in a way), and while it didn‚Äôt seem pigmented initially, it did seem to be more yielding and pliable after a couple of uses (though I feel like that shouldn‚Äôt be necessary and certainly not at this price point!). It applied well to bare skin and was buildable even during the first uses. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,TFX15,Eyeshadow,"a deep red with warm undertones and flecks of lighter pink glitter over a matte finish. I thought that if any brand could innovate in the glitter eyeshadow category, perhaps it would be Tom Ford at this price point, but I wasn‚Äôt seeing it. The texture of the powder was denser and rather pigmented, but the glitter separated away from the base. There was a ton of glitter, so it did translate, but the product did have to be applied with a brush as fingertips were useless‚Äìall the glitter stuck to my fingertip and wouldn‚Äôt transfer to my lid at all. There was a ton of fallout, nonstop, that it was really hard for me to test these as my eyes watered and felt irritated throughout the day, and there were a few instances where I just couldn‚Äôt make it and my eyes were bloodshot.",F
TOM FORD BEAUTY,TFX16,Eyeshadow,"a medium, pinky lavender with flecks of pale gold glitter over a more matte finish. It was incredibly powdery and drier with a ton of fallout during application and nonstop fallout during wear. It was difficult to apply with any evenness or vibrancy, and it just looked like a mess from start to finish.",F
TOM FORD BEAUTY,TFX17,Eyeshadow,"a deep, bluish-teal with flecks of lighter blue glitter. It had opaque color payoff in a single layer, and the texture was definitely firmer, denser, and creamier‚Äìalmost wet in a way‚Äìcompared to other shades. The glitter binded a lot better with the underlying powder, and this ended up being one of the few shades that applied fairly well and lasted without an eight-hour thunderstorm of glitter. There was some fallout, but it wasn‚Äôt too bad (for a glitter eyeshadow).",B
URBAN DECAY,DIRTY TALK,Lipgloss,"a deep, reddened copper with fine gold and pink pearl. It had semi-opaque color payoff with a smooth, plush consistency that didn‚Äôt feel tacky. The gloss applied fairly evenly, but there was slight streaking along the edges of my lips that I could see close-up (but not from afar). The formula was lightly hydrating and seemed to make my lips appear a bit smoother (less lines). It wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",B+
URBAN DECAY,SHADOWHEART,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark, brownish-plum with warm undertones and gold sparkle strewn throughout. It was more cream than sparkle, and the plushness of the consistency made it so I did not feel the sparkles when worn. It had medium coverage, which built up to semi-opaque coverage with a second layer. The texture was comfortable to wear over the four and a half hours it lasted for, though there was a touch of color that settled into my lip lines. It felt lightly moisturizing over time.",B
PHYSICIANS FORMULA,SUNKISSED BRONZER,Bronzer,"a medium brown with warm, orange undertones and a golden sheen. It had excellent pigmentation with a smooth, moderately dense (but not stiff) consistency that was easy to work with as the powder applied evenly on my skin and blended out with little effort. The bronzer stayed on well for eight hours on me before I noticed any fading.",A
NARS,HOT REDS,Palette,"a very cool-toned, pinky red and a brighter, more neutral-toned red. Both shades were nice and quite comfortable for matte liquid lipstick. They are miniature in size‚Äìhalf the size of a full tube‚Äìand together the kit offers $26 in value for $22. It‚Äôs a nice way to try the formula cross two shades, and it sure makes it easier to actually finish one of them sooner rather than later!",A
URBAN DECAY,FAITH,Lipstick,"a soft, medium-dark bronze with warm, coppery undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good color coverage, though it wasn‚Äôt opaque in a single layer. The lipstick was lightweight, thin without being clingy, and had enough slip to glide on without tugging but not enough to feel slippery while worn. It lasted for five hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.",A-
URBAN DECAY,HEAT,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark red with strong, warm undertones and flecks of gold and red shimmer. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a smooth, moderately emollient texture that didn‚Äôt tug when I applied it, but there was a bit of product that settled into my deeper lip lines. The richness of the color made that harder to see from a normal viewing distance, though. I could feel the texture of the sparkle in the tube and when I pressed my lips together. The color wore well for five hours and was hydrating over time. i",B+
COLOUR POP,VACATION MODE,Palette,"almost cool-toned but really is a warmer-toned set of shades. The deepest shade (Round Trip) was a miss for me it as it was drier and harder to blend out, though I was able to make it work with some patience. The other three shades were lovely to use.",B+
TOO FACED,NIP SLIP,Lipstick,"a dark, peachy brown with warm, yellowish undertones and a lightly glossy, cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer that applied evenly across my lips and didn‚Äôt have any streaking despite being a more emollient formula. The texture was lightweight, smooth and lightly creamy but not too thick or too thin, so it was comfortable to wear. It wore well for four and a half hours, which was quite short of the eight hours promised, and was lightly hydrating.w",B
TOO FACED,SKINNY DIPPIN',Lipstick,"a medium peach with warm, orange undertones and a cream finish. It had good color coverage in a single layer with a smooth, creamy consistency that was a bit more prone to separating along my lip lines compared to other shades. It did not look as smooth on my lips, unfortunately. The color was comfortable to wear as it was lightly moisturizing over the four hours it lasted for.",C+
URBAN DECAY,GOLDMINE,Lipgloss,"a medium, molten gold with strong, warm undertones and a sparkly, shiny finish. The base seemed nearly clear with more of a medium-coverage in the form of sparkle and shimmer. There was more texture to the gloss itself on the lips, though it did not feel rough, and I did not have issues with the sparkly bits traveling as it wore away. It applied with good dispersion of the shimmer across the lips, and the product didn‚Äôt gather in my lip lines. It wore well for four hours and was lightly hydrating.",B
URBAN DECAY,CANDY FLIP,Lipgloss,"seemed to have a barely-there pink base with blue-to-violet sparkle and some multi-colored flecks of pearl. I did see slight rainbows at times, so it seemed more holographic than the average makeup product (often more iridescent or duochrome than holographic). It enhanced the natural pink coloring of my lips with semi-sheer coverage through the shimmer and sparkle. The shimmery shades were designed to be sheerer (but somewhat buildable), but I think the brand could be clearer on that through their color descriptions. The gloss was plush enough not to feel gritty from the shimmer, so it was comfortable to wear. It lasted for three and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.",B
URBAN DECAY,SNAPPED,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark, rosy plum base with blue-to-violet pearl and larger sparkle. It had semi-opaque color coverage that went on fairly evenly, though the plummy base could have been more even to my eye. The gloss was smooth and gel-like with very minimal tackiness, and the formula seemed to smooth out my lip lines rather than well into them. It wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing over time.",B+
TOO FACED,NATURAL FACE,Palette,"a new, permanent six-pan cheek palette that features two highlighters, two blushes, and two bronzers. According to the brand, the shades are supposed to have ‚Äúbuildable payoff‚Äù with a ‚Äúvelvety-soft‚Äù texture.‚Äù Some shades are rather pigmented with others being more semi-opaque and buildable, which was the major ‚Äúding‚Äù on this palette. The textures of the shades was soft, smooth, and easy to apply and to use on my skin. They lasted between seven and eight hours on me.",B+
COLOUR POP,JUST DEW IT,Palette,"a shimmery, peachy-orange highlighter and a coral-orange blush. The two shades contrasted nicely between the shimmer and color/tone, so I think they worked well as a duo but could also be worn alone. The blush was more pigmented than described, which may be a happy incident for some.",A
COLOUR POP,QUICKSAND,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, reddish copper with warm undertones and a glittering, metallic finish. There seemed to be a mix of finer pearl and larger sparkle in this particular shade, though the sparkles weren‚Äôt as obvious when I used the product with a dampened brush. The dry application yielded semi-opaque coverage, moderate fallout during application, and six-hour wear. The dampened application yielded opaque, smooth pigmentation that didn‚Äôt have fallout during application and stayed on well for eight hours.",B
COLOUR POP,GOLIGHTLY,Eyeshadow,"a medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. It was another shade that just did not work that well dry; it really is a formula that seems best applied with a dampened brush (and shouldn‚Äôt really be marketed for dry use). The texture felt smooth and silky as it was quite finely-milled, but the coverage was hard to get when I worked with it dry, and when I built up the color, there was a fair amount of fallout during application and shorter wear (six hours). If I applied it with a dampened brush, it yielded opaque, even coverage in a single layer and lasted well for eight hours.",C+
COLOUR POP,BADLANDS,Eyeshadow,"a brighter, medium purple with warm undertones and a satin-to-pearl finish. It had more of a satin finish when applied dry, where more of the base color came through, but it intensified to a more pearly sheen when applied with a dampened brush. The texture was silky to the touch but had some fallout when applied to the lid dry, so it was easier to work with it using a dampened brush to get better coverage and less fussy application. It wore well for seven and a half hours on me dry and almost eight and a half hours dampened.",B-
COLOUR POP,UP SHOT,Eyeshadow,"a medium green with subtle, warm undertones and a pearly sheen. Applied dry, it had semi-sheer coverage with more of a satin-to-pearl finish that had some fallout during application and lasted for six hours on my lids. Applied wet, it had rich color payoff with a smoother, easier application that had very little fallout and lasted for eight hours on me.",B-
COLOUR POP,BABY ROO,Eyeshadow,"a medium purple with warm undertones and flecks of copper micro-sparkle and smaller frosted shimmer. It had sheer coverage applied dry, but it intensified to mostly opaque coverage when applied with a dampened brush. It wasn‚Äôt a shade I‚Äôd recommend unless you tend to use your loose eyeshadows with dampened brushes or over tacky bases. The texture was soft and finely-milled, so it blended out well along the edges but had some fallout if I worked with it dry. On its own, it lasted for six hours (dry) and eight hours (dampened).",C-
PHYSICIANS FORMULA,VINTAGE ROUGE,Blush,"a medium-dark peach with warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had medium coverage, which was buildable to semi-opaque coverage with three layers. The texture was velvety and soft to the touch with a smidgen of dustiness in the pan, but it blended out beautifully on my skin and sat well without looking dry or chalky. The blush was easy to work with and lasted for eight hours on me.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,BLACK ONYX,Eyeshadow,"a medium black with larger, silver glitter over a satin base. The texture was drier and somewhat chunky in the pan, so the base color appeared a bit uneven and ragged along the edges when blended, though it had a thicker feel overall so that most of the glitter seemed to bind with the powder on the lid. This meant less fallout during application and during wear, though there was still some fallout after eight hours of wear. It could have been easier to blend and to apply evenly, while the mostly opaque coverage was the highlight of the shade.",C
TOM FORD BEAUTY,BREATHLESS,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium, golden beige with warm undertones and flecks of golden glitter. It had a slightly wet-like feel to it, which reminded me of the brand‚Äôs glittery eyeshadows in their quads but with a finer, more pigmented base and finer particles overall. It had good pigmentation that applied evenly with minimal fallout, though there was some fallout that was noticeable after eight hours of wear (when the eyeshadow itself seemed to fade a bit).",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,LOVESHADE,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium coral-orange with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which was buildable to opaque coverage with two layers. The texture was soft and velvety, though a little powdery in the pan. I felt like it applied and worked better in practice than it seemed to an in the initial swatch. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,NAKED CITY,Eyeshadow,"a light peach with warm undertones and a matte finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a single stroke, while the consistency was velvety and smooth without being powdery. The color applied beautifully to the skin and blended out nicely. It lasted for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,PURPLE REIGN,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark purple with cool undertones and a pearly sheen. It had good color coverage, though it wasn‚Äôt opaque and was hard to build up without a primer underneath it. The texture was soft to the touch but was a bit thin, so I felt like it often lost some vibrancy when blended and worked with on the lid. This shade stayed on well for seven hours before fading on me.",B-
COLOUR POP,RACE YOU,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and warmer gold flecks of sparkle. It had medium coverage, which did not build upt, and it was extremely difficult to apply this shade evenly and maintain any pop of color as seen in the pan. It just ended up looking more faded and patchy on the lid. The eyeshadow still wore well with slight fallout but no fading or creasing over a 10-hour period, though.",D
COLOUR POP,RIPPLE,Eyeshadow,"a brighter, medium-dark lavender with warm, pink undertones and a pearly sheen with slight iridescent sparkle. It had good color payoff with a smooth, lightly wet consistency that applied fairly evenly to bare skin and blended out well along the edges. This shade lasted for 10 hours with very little fallout over time.",B+
COLOUR POP,SUPERFLY,Eyeshadow,"a muted, but darker, purple base with shifting, blue-to-teal pearl. It was an interesting shade and certainly one I haven‚Äôt seen too often in products, but I wish it was more pigmented and had less slip as it was hard to build it up on its own. The eyeshadow worked best applied over other products, like eyeliner or another eyeshadow, to get the shift to become more pronounced without worrying about any unevenness from the lack of coverage of the shade on its own. By itself, the eyeshadow wore well for 10 hours on me without fading or creasing.",C-
COLOUR POP,BUZZIN,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, pinky mauve with strong, warm undertones with flecks of gold sparkle over a matte finish. Since it has a cream formulation, the sparkles go on better and stay embedded in the eyeshadow on the lid than compared to a powder eyeshadow. However, I found that the sparkles would move and migrate if I tried to blend it out, so it ended up suffering the same fate as powder eyeshadows‚Äìpretty much just a matte eyeshadow in practice. It had opaque coverage, was easy to blend, and lasted well for 10 hours on me (with no signs of fading or creasing‚Ä¶ no fallout as there was nothing left to fall out!).",A
URBAN DECAY,FUEL,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium coral with fine gold pearl. It had semi-opaque color coverage in a single layer, which was buildable to mostly opaque coverage with a second layer. The consistency was lightweight, smooth and gel-like without being tacky, and it was comfortable to wear with the lightly moisturizing formula. It wasn‚Äôt quite as plush nor as smoothing as other shades in the line, though.",B
URBAN DECAY,1993,Lipgloss,"a medium, caramel brown with warm, golden undertones and a high-shine finish. The consistency is where the gloss excels‚Äìit‚Äôs plush, gel-like with very little tackiness, but it adhered well to the lips and smoothed out my lip lines (rather than filling them like some glosses). It had semi-opaque coverage that went on evenly and lasted for four hours on me. The formula was lightly hydrating over time.",A-
URBAN DECAY,OBSESSED,Lipgloss,"a soft, light-medium pink with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. It was part of the ‚ÄúSheer Cream‚Äù finish, so the semi-sheer coverage was expected. I think that the product itself was rather even, but the way it brought out the natural pink tones in my natural lip color made it appear uneven (as my lip color itself isn‚Äôt perfectly even, so combined with the sheer, pink color, the end result was more my fault than the product‚Äôs). The gloss had a lightweight, smooth, and plush feel on my lips and helped to smooth out my lip lines. It wore well for three hours on me but was lightly hydrating.",B+
PHYSICIANS FORMULA,ROSY PINK,Blush,"a medium pink with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. There was just a hint of sheen to the finish when buffed and blended out on the skin but no distinctive shimmer particles. The texture was smooth to the touch but more firmly pressed in the pan, so it took a heavier hand or denser brush to pickup product well. It had semi-sheer, buildable coverage (up to semi-opaque) in a single layer. The powder blended out easily on the skin and lasted for eight hours on me.",B-
COLOUR POP,BUBBLE BEE,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium tangerine with warm, yellow undertones and a golden shimmer and micro-sparkle. It had opaque color payoff in a single layer with a smooth, lightly emollient texture that was spongy to the touch. The eyeshadow applied evenly to bare skin and blended out nicely, though it read a bit more of a satin-to-pearl finish on the lid (seemed a bit more metallic in the pot). It stayed on well for over 10 hours on me.",A
COLOUR POP,EXO,Eyeshadow,"a brighter, medium-dark, pinky-plum with warmer undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good color coverage, though it had a tendency to lose some of its strength and opacity as it blended out on the skin, so it needed to be applied in layers for maximum coverage. The texture felt a touch drier to me when I worked with it, though it was still fairly blendable and easy to work with. The eyeshadow lasted for over 10 hours on me.",A-
COLOUR POP,LADYBIRD,Eyeshadow,"a light, peachy beige with warm undertones and a glittery finish. It had semi-opaque coverage packed full tons of glitter, which I think made it look more pigmented as it twinkled in person compared to in a still photo. If you‚Äôre someone who tends to brighten the inner corner, center of the lid, or lower lash line, it would be a useful shade for that purpose. The consistency was smooth, spongy to the touch, with just enough slip to apply evenly and diffuse along the edges without all the glitter dropping during application. There was slight fallout over time, but there was a significant amount that stayed right where it was supposed to over 10 hours of wear.",B+
COLOUR POP,POLLY,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, rosy copper with subtle, warm undertones and a glittery finish. It had semi-sheer coverage and was hard to build up as the texture had a moderate amount of slip, so it just felt a little wet and thin on the skin, even after it dried down and set. Patted on top of another eyeshadow, it worked decently, but it wasn‚Äôt the easiest to work with. It wore well for 10 hours with light fallout over time.",C
COLOUR POP,WINGING IT,Palette,"a shimmering, cooler pink highlighter paired with a bright lavender blush. I loved the way this duo came together‚Äìthere was enough difference in depth where they could be used in different proportions to create a few different types of gradients. Both shades were nice with respect to how much pigmentation they were supposed to have, and they were easy to apply and lasted well, though the highlighter did emphasize skin texture as it was quite intense.",A
SEPHORA,TRIPPIN (50),Lipstick,"a medium lavender with strong, cool undertones and a cream finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque in a single stroke with just a bit of translucency in some places as it did not adhere as evenly as it could have. The texture was lightweight, creamy with moderate slip, and for the type of shade, it went on impressively‚Äìbut there was still a little room for improvement! It wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing.",A-
SEPHORA,FESTIVAL LIGHTS (51),Lipstick,"a deep copper with warm, red undertones and gold and copper sparkle. It had semi-opaque color coverage that applied fairly evenly across my lips, though I could feel the texture of the glitter as I glided the lipstick over my lips. It was fairly comfortable to wear as there was enough slip to keep it from feeling clingy but not so much that it moved around too readily while worn. This shade stayed on well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M536 MILK TEA,Eyeshadow,"a very light brown with soft, warm yellow undertones and a matte finish. The texture was velvety and smooth with a touch of dustiness in the pan. It had good color coverage that adhered well to bare skin. The eyeshadow lasted for nine hours on me before fading.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M540 GRAY BEIGE,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium taupe with subtle, olive undertone and a matte finish. It had good color payoff with a soft, smooth consistency that was easy to work with on the lid. The eyeshadow applied evenly and stayed on well for nine hours before starting to fade on me.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M549 DARK TAUPE,Eyeshadow,"a medium taupe with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque in a single layer and buildable to full coverage with a second layer patted on top. The eyeshadow had a soft, velvety texture that had substance to it, so it applied well to bare skin and blended out with ease. It wore well for nine hours on me before fading.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M600 PINK BROWN,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium brown with warm, rosy undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was soft and blendable, though it was a little thinner compared to other shades in the formula, so it did not apply as evenly initially. I was able to diffuse and blend everything out without much work, though. It had good, buildable pigmentation that stayed on well for nine hours.",B
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M603 CINNAMON,Eyeshadow,"a medium brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had rich color coverage in a single layer paired with a smooth, velvety texture that had enough substance to be easy to work with on bare skin (thinner mattes often require primer or else they don‚Äôt blend out well). This shade wore well for nine hours on me before I noticed signs of fading.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M619 ESPRESSO,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark taupe-brown with neutral-to-cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation with a soft, lightly dusty texture that was blendable and fairly easy to use on the lid. The eyeshadow started to fade on me after nine hours of wear.",B
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M631 CAPPUCCINO,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium brown with warm, golden undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was smooth and velvety without being powdery, so it adhered evenly to bare skin but still blended out with ease. It had rich color payoff that stayed on well for nine and a half hours of wear.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M647 SPECULOOS,Eyeshadow,"a light brown with warm, golden undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The eyeshadow felt smooth to the touch without being powdery. It applied well to bare skin, blended out with ease, and lasted for nine hours on me.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M742 TOMATO,Eyeshadow,"a rich, orange-red with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had intense pigmentation in a single layer, while the consistency was smooth and almost cream-like as it was denser in the pan. It adhered evenly to bare skin and blended out fairly easily, though it could have been more blendable. The color wore well for 12 hours on me before fading slightly.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M842 WINE,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, berry purple with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation with a soft, lightly dusty consistency. The eyeshadow was fairly easy to work with as it blended out nicely along the edges and could be built up but was a product I‚Äôd use over primer for maximum ease of use. It wore well for nine and a half hours before fading noticeably on me.",B-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M856 FRESH PINK,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. The eyeshadow had a very smooth, velvety consistency that wasn‚Äôt powdery and had some substance to it, so it was a pleasure to work with it over bare skin as the color went on evenly and blended out nicely without losing its intensity or coverage. It was richly pigmented and stayed on well for nine hours.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M860 POWDERY PINK,Eyeshadow,"a medium pink with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good color coverage, though it was hard to build up to full coverage without a primer. The texture was smooth to the touch, dense, and a touch firmer in the pan compared to other shades. It applied fairly evenly, but I had no trouble with blending it out. This shade wore well for nine hours before fading slightly.",B
BITE BEAUTY,ARIES,Lipstick,"a rich, orange-red with warm undertones and a satin finish. It read (red!) more orange than red on me by a hair, and it did seem to look slightly rustier as time went on and not quite as bright once the sheen faded down to a more soft matte finish (about two hours of wear). The consistency was smooth, creamy with a touch of tackiness so that the lipstick doesn‚Äôt tug during application but the color goes on evenly and adheres well to the lips for longer wear. It had opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and stayed on well for over six hours. The formula was hydrating while worn.",A+
NARS,CAPRI,Highlighter,"a soft, pinkish peach with warm, beige undertones and a luminous sheen. It had semi-opaque coverage, which was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The powder was smooth, firmer but not difficult to blend out or apply to the skin, and wasn‚Äôt powdery at all. There was a moderate shine that could be intensified to semi-metallic with more product. It applied evenly to my cheekbones, diffused easily along the edges, and stayed in place for eight and a half hours.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,SS18,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark black with neutral-to-warm undertones and lots of glitter and finer sparkle. It had good pigmentation and was one of the better Glitter finish shades in the range, as the glitter actually seemed to mix with the underlying base color rather than sit on top of it. The eyeshadow had some fallout during application but most of the glitter seemed to translate onto the lid. The eyeshadow itself was drier so it was harder to diffuse the edge seamlessly. It wore well for eight hours but had some fallout over time.",C+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,TFX1,Eyeshadow,"a medium, golden pewter with subtle, warm olive undertones and a metallic sheen. It had excellent pigmentation paired with a smooth, almost cream-like texture that didn‚Äôt feel too slippery or too thick but still had the luxuriousness of creamier formulas. The eyeshadow applied well to bare skin and lasted for nine hours before creasing faintly.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,TFX3,Eyeshadow,"a brighter, medium pink with subtle, cool undertones and a pearly sheen. It had good pigmentation, though it wasn‚Äôt opaque, with a smooth, almost slippery texture, which I felt contributed to making it less pigmented and more prone to applying a bit unevenly. It wore well for eight and a half hours before creasing.",B
BENEFIT,BLUSH BAR,Palette,"a new, limited edition five-shade cheek palette that features five of the brand‚Äôs Box o‚Äô Powders (all are available individually if preferred). One issue I have with Benefit‚Äôs cheek palettes is that I don‚Äôt find they‚Äôre as consistent as they should be when compared to the single versions (colors are often a bit off, otherwise textures/pigmentation differs). The shades were fairly easy to use and wore between six and eight hours on me. There was one major miss, and then one that was so-so, which left me with a ‚Äúdecent but not great‚Äù kind of impression.",B
URBAN DECAY,FIREBALL,Lipgloss,"a medium, peachy coral base with fine pink pearl and larger gold sparkle. It seemed to bring out the natural pink tones in my lips quite a bit, as it had semi-sheer coverage but yielded greater visual impact as it made my natural color pinker and deeper. I expect the gloss to look different from person to person based on their natural lip color, though. It lasted for four hours and was hydrating on me.",B+
URBAN DECAY,NAKED,Lipgloss,"a soft, medium pink with warm undertones and a fine, pink and gold pearl strewn throughout it. This particular shade is a ‚ÄúSheer Cream‚Äù so the semi-sheer coverage was expected. The gloss went on evenly and smoothly across my lips with a gel-like texture that was plush with just a touch of tackiness. It wore well for four hours and was hydrating.",A-
URBAN DECAY,MIDNIGHT COWGIRL,Lipgloss,"a soft, peachy-pink with gold pearl with a cream-like sheen. It had semi-sheer coverage that applied evenly across my lips and had a milkier appearance, though it did not emphasize my lip lines and made my lips appear smoother overall. The consistency was lightweight, smooth, and gel-like without being heavy or thick. It wore well for four hours and was moisturizing.",A-
MAC,NAKED BOND,Eyeliner,"a rich, molten copper with warm, orange undertones and a metallic sheen. It was opaque in a single layer, while the consistency was smooth and very fluid (I‚Äôd say slightly too fluid for maximum control), but it applied evenly and dried down within five minutes. If I used a separate brush to apply, so I could go with a thinner layer, I was able to wear it on my lower lash line without getting half of it into my fine lines, but if I used the included brush-type applicator, it looked like fireworks exploded underneath my eyes before it could dry down. Once it set, the eyeliner showed no signs of fading or flaking after 14 hours of wear.",B+
MAC,POINT BLACK,Eyeliner,"a deep black with neutral undertones and a matte finish. The liquid eyeliner has a smooth, fluid consistency that wasn‚Äôt quite as wet as other shades in the range, which made it slightly easier to control and helped it dry down faster. I noticed that this shade clung to the skin, though, and felt a little like shrink-wrap on my skin, which wasn‚Äôt something I experienced with other shades. It was still going strong after 14 hours of wear.",B+
MAC,RICH AND ROBUST,Eyeliner,"a rich berry with cool undertones and a sprinkling of violet pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation which was somewhat buildable, but it wasn‚Äôt as easy to build up as other shades. The texture was thin, smooth, and fluid without being too wet, and it dried down within a few minutes. It showed no signs of fading or flaking after 14 hours of wear.",B-
MAC,WET ROAD,Eyeliner,"a deep black with silver pearl. It had opaque color payoff that applied evenly to bare skin with a smooth, fluid consistency that was wet and took three to four minutes to dry down. The texture wasn‚Äôt too wet compared to other shaes, and it seemed easier to control on the lash line. I didn‚Äôt see any fading or flaking after 14 hours of wear.",A-
NARS,WANTED VOL II,Palette,"a new, limited edition cheek palette that includes six shades from shimmery peach to tangerine to rich plum. There were three matte shades and three shimmery shades. I think that as a composition, this particular palette has a lot of variety in depth and finish but definitely contains bolder shades overall so it is best suited for someone who has a light hand (but wants depth) or needs richer, deeper hues for their skin tone.",A-
MAC,BLUE ME OVER,Eyeliner,"a bright, medium blue with subtle, cool undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was buildable to mostly opaque coverage with a second layer. The consistency was very fluid and seemed more on the watery side, but I was able to control it for a less-shaky line compared to some shades in the range. It took a few minutes to dry down, and it was hard to keep it out of my fine lines when I tried on my lower lash line while it was drying. It showed no signs of fading, flaking, or movement after 14 hours of wear.",B-
MAC,COCO BAR,Eyeliner,"a muted, medium-dark brown with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. When applied in a thinner layer, it dried down within three to four minutes, but it took some doing as the consistency was very fluid and richly pigmented, so it was easy to over-apply with how much was on the applicator. I had better luck using a separate brush to apply it so that the dry down wasn‚Äôt ridiculously long to the point where the liner bled into my fine lines. Once set, it was still going strong after 14 hours of wear.",B
MAC,KEEP IT CURRANT,Eyeliner,"a rich, deep red with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. The dry down time was incredibly long; the swatch was taken after five minutes, and it only mostly dried down when applied in a thinner layer after that wait time. When I applied just a single stroke of the product across my arm (the left side of the swatch), it was still very wet after five minutes. The texture was very fluid and less controllable, though those who may be more experienced using brush-type liquid eyeliners may not find it overly challenging. It was very pigmented and once it set, I didn‚Äôt see any signs of movement after 14 hours of wear.",C+
MAC,LATE NIGHT,Eyeliner,"a deep green with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It took five minutes for a thin, even layer of product to dry down, but when I applied a single stroke using the brush-type applicator, it was still wet in places after 10 minutes of waiting. The texture was lightweight, smooth, and fluid with opaque coverage in a single layer. I found it easier to control the amount of product and avoid excessive drying times by using a separate brush or else it would feather into my fine lines as it dried down. Once set, it stayed on well for over 14 hours (no signs of change).",B
MAC,MISTY ME,Eyeliner,"a bright, metallic silver with cooler undertones. It had excellent pigmentation in a single layer that applied fairly evenly in a fluid stroke, though it had a wetter formula that took three to four minutes to dry down. I found this shade to be one of the easier ones to use as it dried down a little faster and wasn‚Äôt as prone to spreading into fine lines.",B
NARS,ST. BARTHS,Highlighter,"a medium-dark copper with warm, orange undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good color coverage in a single layer, though it took two layers for full coverage (if desired). The powder had a smooth, firmer consistency in the pan, but I had no trouble picking up product on my typpical, go-to highlighter brushes (both fan and tapered). It applied beautifully my skin and blended out with little to no effort on my part‚Äìit felt like the type of product that did the work for you. The finish was strong and shiny but did not accentuate my skin‚Äôs natural texture to my eye. It wore well for nine hours on me before fading a bit.",A
URBAN DECAY,BACKTALK,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette exclusive to Sephora. It‚Äôs a warm-toned palette with a pinker-leaning, but I don‚Äôt think that it resulted in quite the berry/mauve (read: cooler-toned) palette that readers expected when it was initially launched. I think that the palette may suffer from a lack of versatility, as I felt like a lot of potential looks looked rather similar, but for someone who is after a certain type of look, the color scheme might work just fine.",B
MAC,ICED HEATHER/KERALA SUN,Palette,"a light silver and light gold. Each side is almost the equivalent to a full-sized Powerpoint Eye Pencil (0.04 oz.), so there‚Äôs actually a lot of value here. I wish that the formula was more pigmented and a bit creamier, which I think would help deliver more even coverage.",B-
MAC,INDIAN INK/MOSSY GREEN,Palette,"navy blue and pearly green pencil eyeliners. Each side is almost the equivalent to a full-sized Powerpoint Eye Pencil (0.04 oz.), so there‚Äôs actually a lot of value here. The downside is that the formula isn‚Äôt that pigmented and doesn‚Äôt build up as well as it could, though both shades were long-wearing on me.",B
NATASHA DENONA,TROPIC,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette for spring that includes a mix of mattes and shimmers with two rows of more neutral-hued shades and one row featuring pops of color. The matte eyeshadows were nice‚Äì= smooth and blendable, though a touch dry‚Äìbut the shimmers were more inconsistent. Both Mint Frost and Tiger Lily were extremely dense, which made them stiffer and harder to work with; Tiger Lily was workable but Mint Frost was more challenging as it was also very chunky.",B
MAC,BORDEAUXLINE/MOLE BROWN,Palette,"an eggplant purple and a deep brown. Each side is almost the equivalent to a full-sized Powerpoint Eye Pencil (0.04 oz.), so there‚Äôs actually a lot of value here. I wasn‚Äôt in love with either shade as both required at least two (if not three) layers to get closer to opaque, even coverage. They were long-wearing and seemed to be waterproof, though.",B-
VISEART,SIREN,Palette,"three matte eyeshadows and three shimmer eyeshadows with all six being strongly warm-toned. If you‚Äôre someone who hasn‚Äôt indulged in the plethora of warm neutral palettes that have released in the last couple of years, it‚Äôs good enough to be worth considering.",A-
NARS,WANTED VOL I,Palette,"a new, limited edition cheek palette that features six shades ranging from shimmery peach to soft lavender to rich coral. I would consider it a warm-toned palette, though, and the shades skew more light to light-medium in depth (Vol. II is richer and deeper across the board). Two of the matte shades darkened noticeably on me and even a bit more as the day went along, which may or may not be an issue for some. To combat that, I‚Äôd powder lightly prior to applying blush and then setting afterward, and I do find that helps mitigate a lot of darkening with more matte shades. Most of the shades were pigmented, wore seven to eight hours, and were fairly blendable.",B+
NATASHA DENONA,SUNSET,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette that features five miniature-sized eyeshadows in a slim, plastic case. I like the concept a lot, particularly with a brand like Natasha Denona that charges premium prices, because I think it can take quite awhile to even finish a standard eyeshadow (if ever; I don‚Äôt really know that world, you know!). The three shimmer shades could have been a bit better (Apollo in particular), but the two mattes were lovely.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,EMERALD ISLES,Palette,"a sparkling, gold powder eyeshadow and a deep, forest green cream eyeshadow. This has to be one of the better coordinating duos I‚Äôve seen from Tom Ford‚Äìthere‚Äôs plenty of contrast between the two shades but they can be layered and blended into each other for a seamless gradient as their undertones are similar. Both products worked well for me with the cream eyeshadow being the real stunner between the two.",A
MAC,SHRIMPTON,Lipstick,"a light-medium peach with warm undertones and a satin finish. The lipstick had opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips without tugging. I was impressed by how evenly it applied given how light the color was. The texture was lightweight, thicker (which I felt helped keep it from emphasizing my lip lines), and comfortable to wear. The color lasted for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
MAC,ICON,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark bronze with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had medium coverage that was buildable to semi-opaque pigmentation with two to three layers. The lipstick was smooth, lightly creamy with moderate slip and a thin consistency that glided across my lips without tugging. It wore well for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
MAC,SPANISH FLY,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, plummy brown with warm undertones and blue-to-teal shifting pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a lightweight, thin, lightly emollient texture that glided across my lips easily and was comfortable to wear. The color went on evenly and stayed on well for four and a half hours. My lips didn‚Äôt feel dry after wearing this shade.",B+
MAC,BRONX,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark beige with warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. The texture was denser and firmer in the tube, though it didn‚Äôt seem to drag on my lips, but it did apply a thinner layer of product that was more prone to emphasizing my lip texture. It wore well for four and a half hours but was somewhat drying over time.",B
NARS,ALBATROSS,Highlighter,"a bright, light white gold with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable color payoff that applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin. The powder blended out effortlessly, and the more I buffed and worked the powder onto my skin, the shinier and more metallic it looked, though it did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. It wore well for almost nine hours on me before fading slightly.",A-
MAC,DESERT DUSK,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette that contains two mattes and two shimmers with three shades being more neutral in hue (the fourth shade is a pop of blue). It was a decent quad, and I suspect that some will love the inclusion of the blue shade while others will find it doesn‚Äôt contribute to a cohesive look.",B+
VISEART,ABSINTHE,Palette,"a new addition to the Theory range, and it features a mix of neutrals and greens. I liked the color story, and I think the six shades worked well together. I wasn‚Äôt keen on the addition of random glitter particles in two of the shimmer shades, as I did not feel they contributed positively‚Äìthey just resulted in fallout during application but did not look sparkly or glittery on. I also found one shade (#4) to be weakly pigmented compared to the other five shades.",A-
MAC,SKEW,Lipstick,"a medium pink with warmer undertones and cooler pink and violet pearl. I found the color harder to find dupes for, so despite the medium coverage, I could see it working well for some‚Äìit had a tendency to emphasise the natural lip color while still adding something to it. The texture was lightweight, emollient without being slippery on my lips, and was comfortable to wear over the four hours it lasted for. It was lightly hydrating over time to me.",B+
MAC,MARRAKESH,Lipstick,"a rich, coppery red with warm undertones and a satin finish. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, creamy consistency that was easy to apply and delivered even, opaque coverage in a fluid stroke. The lipstick wasn‚Äôt too thick or too then, and it adhered well for six-hour wear. The formula was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",A
MAC,ROCKER,Lipstick,"a deep red with strong, cool pink undertones and a satin finish with faint pearl. It had good color coverage in a single layer, which applied fairly evenly, though I noticed it didn‚Äôt adhere as well to the inner area of my lips. The lipstick was lightweight, just creamy enough not to tug, but it did not feel slippery when worn. This shade stayed on well for over six hours, left a stain behind, and was non-drying.",A-
PHYSICIANS FORMULA,PINK,Highlighter,"a medium pink with strong, warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good color payoff that was buildable to opaque coverage. The consistency was lightweight, smooth, and creamy without being thick or overly glossy. The formula definitely felt more powder-like once I started to work with it on my skin but had initially felt more like a cream formula in the pot. I noticed that this shade did not apply as evenly as others in the line-up, though it still applied well overall. It went on lighter as I diffused and blended it out and did not have as much color/tint as I expected. It lasted well for nine and a half hours on me before fading a bit.",A-
MAC,NUDE FUDGE,Lipstick,"a medium plum with warm undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was opaque in one, fluid stroke with a lightly creamy texture that was a little thicker, so it covered well, but did not feel heavy nor did it emphasize my lip lines. It was easy to apply and wore well for five and a half hours, though it was neither drying nor hydrating over time.",A-
MAC,SUMAC,Lipstick,"a deep plum with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage in a single layer, which was hard to build up as the color did not adhere evenly and had a tendency to slip into my lip lines. The texture was lightewight and did not seem overly emollient, despite the poorer application. It lasted for five and a half hours, but it further settled into my lip lines over time and was non-drying.",B-
MAC,SUNSET ROSE,Lipstick,"a soft, medium pink with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had good pigmentation with a lightweight, lightly creamy texture that was thin without being clingy or prone to gathering in my lip lines. The color went on evenly and stayed on well for four and a half hours. The formula felt lightly hydrating while worn.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,AZURE SUN,Palette,"a peachy, sparkly powder eyeshadow and a rich, teal cream eyeshadow. I‚Äôm a big fan of the wear of Tom Ford‚Äôs cream typically, but I found the shade included in the duo to be hard to use on its own (which limited the versatility of the product).",B
MAC,APRICOT GOLD,Lipstick,"a medium, peachy brown with warm, orange undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a soft, lightly creamy texture that had moderate slip and glided across my lips without tugging. The color applied evenly and stayed on well for four and a half hours with a lightly hydrating feel over time.",A-
MAC,BLUE BLOOD,Lipstick,"a bright, medium red with strong, cool undertones and a matte finish. The color payoff was fantastic, while the consistency was smooth, velvety, and firm without being too stiff that it dragged on my lips. It wore well for over six hours, left a stain behind, and felt a touch drying after five hours of wear.",A
MAC,MITTAI PINK,Lipstick,"a slightly muted, medium-dark raspberry pink with subtle, cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a fluid stroke, and it had a smooth, velvety consistency that was dense and lightly creamy but a bit thicker on the lip. It stayed on for six hours, left a faint stain behind, and was slightly drying after five hours of wear.",A-
MAKEUP REVOLUTION,LIQUID LUMINOUS LUNA,Highlighter,"a light white with subtle, warm undertones and a luminous finish. It lightened and brightened the area I applied it, so it might not work as well for all skin tones, but anyone who finds most highlighters too dark for them will likely find this one worth looking into. It had semi-sheer, buildable pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly over my skin, and it did well patted over liquid foundation and did not lift up my base products either. The texture was lightweight, thin with some slip but not enough to feel or look greasy on my skin. It wore well for nine hours on me before fading noticeably.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,EXOTIC FLORA,Palette,"a pop of rich pink and coral housed in a large, plastic compact. Per the brand, the formula yields a ‚Äúsoft veil of color‚Äù when applied wet and a ‚Äúsweeping pop of vibrancy‚Äù when applied dry. The formula was pigmented regardless of application method, but the dampened application looked a bit more like a cream blush on than it did when applied dry. The formula had a denser, firmer feel in the pan, so denser brushes tended to work best.",B
ANASTASIA,MAUDE,Lipstick,"a dark, red-brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had opaque pigmentation in a single layer, and the color went on evenly across my lips without drying down and looking ‚Äúcracked‚Äù when I smiled. The consistency was a bit thicker and rather fluid, so a little went a long way and made it harder to apply the color precisely along the edges of my upper lip (I‚Äôd recommend wiping off some of the excess as you‚Äôre pulling the wand out). This shade wore well for seven hours and was slightly drying after five hours of wear.",A-
ANASTASIA,NOCTURNAL,Lipstick,"a deep, navy blue with cool undertones and a flat, matte finish. The color payoff was opaque in one swipe, while the consistency was nicely balanced between thin, fluid, and smooth, so it applied easily along the edges of my lips but still had even coverage that didn‚Äôt take too long to dry down (but still had some play time). It stayed on well for seven and a half hours and started to feel a bit drying after five hours of wear.",A
PHYSICIANS FORMULA,ROSE GOLD,Highlighter,"a medium copper with warm, reddish undertones and a metallic sheen. It had opaque pigmentation in a single layer, but it was easy to blend out or apply less for sheerer coverage if preferred. The highlighter had a moist, spongy consistency when pressed and touched in the pan, but it applied more powder-like and was thinner without any true glossiness (but plenty of shine!) on my cheeks. It applied easily and blended out with little effort. The shine was strong but stopped just shy of emphasizing my skin‚Äôs natural texture. It wore well for almost 10 hours on me.",A+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,NUDE GLOW,Palette,"a large, cheek trio that features two shades that are more like highlighters (or highlighting blushes) and one that‚Äôs a definite blush. I felt like the colors overlapped with past trio releases, so if one has the previous iterations, this seemed redundant (or even duped). If you‚Äôve been waiting for the right trio to splurge on, it could be one to consider if you don‚Äôt mind a more pigmented set of shades (they‚Äôre marketed as ‚Äúsheer to medium‚Äù in coverage).",B
SEPHORA,JUST ADD TINSEL (48),Lipstick,"a medium-dark gray with cool, silver and teal pearl. It had medium coverage, which was buildable to semi-opaque pigmentation. The consistency was lightweight, smooth, and had some slip but was a little on the thin side. The color went on somewhat evenly but could have been more pigmented and gentler to my lip lines, as there was a bit of product that pulled into them. It wore well for four hours and was lightly moisturizing over time.",B-
SEPHORA,OUCH (49),Lipstick,"a medium, green-leaning teal with warm, gold sparkle. It had semi-sheer pigmentation that did not build up well, as the texture was chunkier and had a tendency to clump up on my lips. It was a really nifty shade, but it applied so poorly that it would be hard to wear without a primer/lip liner underneath. It lasted for four hours but settled into my lip lines heavily. It was a little hydrating, though!",F
MAKEUP REVOLUTION,LIQUID EUPHORIC GOLD,Highlighter,"a light gold with warm, yellow undertones and a luminous sheen. The consistency was thin but not watery and had some slip, almost like an oil-based product, but it didn‚Äôt feel overly slippery or greasy on my skin and d. The liquid highlighter was buildable from sheer to mostly opaque coverage, and the color and pearl spread evenly over my cheek bones without lifting up base product. It wore well for nine hours on me before fading slightly.",A
BITE BEAUTY,SUGAR BEET,Lipstick,"a medium purple with subtle, cool undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. It was richly pigmented in one layer, and the color applied evenly but had a tendency to sit in my lip lines more than other shades in the range. I don‚Äôt think it was very noticeable from a normal viewing distance, though. The texture was smooth, creamy, and slightly thicker compared to the average shade in this formula. It wore well for five hours and was moisturizing over time.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,YUCCA,Lipstick,"a medium brown with strong, warm undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. The liquid lipstick had a smooth, spreadable consistency that wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin. It applied evenly and didn‚Äôt emphpasize my lip lines, but it did not smooth them out as much as some of the higher performing shades have in this formula. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, and it stayed on nicely for six hours and kept my lips hydrated.",A
COLOUR POP,STROBE GLOBE,Highlighter,"a light-medium, champagne gold with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation, though when I applied it with a tapered highlighting brush, it seemed to be nearly opaque on my cheeks. The powder was finely-milled and silky, and it diffused easily across my skin and never lost its intense, high-shine finish. It emphasized my skin‚Äôs texture just slightly, but if worn more sheerly, it did not. On me, it wore well for eight and a half hours on me.",A-
MAC,GOLDBIT,Eyeshadow,"a light, golden peach with warm undertones and flecks of gold glitter. It has a Lustre finish, where coverage is (by design) sheerer and the finish has larger glitter particles. I found it had more semi-opaque pigmentation with some glitter but it was smoother and easier to use than the average Lustre eyeshadow. The consistency was soft, blendable, and sat fairly well on bare skin but some fallout occurred during initial application. It wore well for seven and a half hours on me before fading.",B-
MAC,KID,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark beige with warm undertones and a matte finish. The color payoff was opaque in a single layer, while the texture felt soft and smooth without having a lot of powderiness, yet it remained blendable during application. It lasted for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.",A
MAC,TETE-A-TINT,Eyeshadow,"a muted, light-medium brown with warm, peachy undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was smooth and velvety with a touch of powderiness; it felt slightly less silky compared to the last iteration I have of it, but it was still easy to apply to the lid and blend out along the edges. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that stayed on well for eight hours.",A-
MAC,UNINTERRUPTED,Eyeshadow,"a medium brown with strong, warm yellow undertones and a matte finish. It was richly pigmented and had a smooth, soft, and blendable texture that was a touch dusty in the pan, but it applied evenly to bare skin and was easy to work with on the lid. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,D104 BLACK DIAMOND,Eyeshadow,"a deep black with a satin finish and larger, silver sparkle. The consistency was denser and thicker with a creamier feel overall, which helped the larger sparkles bind with the underlying color and minimized fallout. It was richly pigmented and applied well to bare skin but took slightly more effort to diffuse along the edges due to the thicker texture. This shade lasted for 10 hours on me.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,ME512 GOLDEN BEIGE,Eyeshadow,"a soft gold with warm undertones and a metallic finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin. The texture was firmer but still pliable enough to pickup with ease using a flat brush and adhered well to my lid, though it requires pressing and patting rather than sweeping on for best results (which is consistent with the original Artist formula). It wore well for nine and a half hours on me.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,ME644 ICED BROWN,Eyeshadow,"a rich, golden bronze with warm, red undertones and a metallic sheen. The pigmentation was incredibly rich in a single layer with smooth, even color coverage that was easy to apply to my lid. The consistency was dense, lightly creamy, and blendable. It wore well for 10 hours on me before fading slightly.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,S560 TAUPE,Eyeshadow,"a soft brown with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. The color payoff was opaque in one layer, while the texture was firmer and felt like it had quite a bit of silicone in it, as it was velvety to the touch but harder to pick up with a brush without using a heavier hand. It seemed to apply better to my lid in practice, though I would recommend pressing and pulling the color across the lid rather than sweeping or more feathery motions. This shade lasted well for nine hours on me before fading a bit.",B
ANASTASIA,INSOMNIAC,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, muted blue-teal with cool undertones and a flat, matte finish. The color payoff was fantastic with full, opaque coverage in a single layer. The color applied evenly and easily across my lips with a smooth, fluid consistency that wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin. I very much appreciated that it was a non-traditional shade but still packed all the pigmentation it needed to have in order to go on beautifully. The color wore well for seven and a half hours and was a bit drying after five hours of wear.",A
ANASTASIA,MALT,Lipstick,"a deep brown with strong, warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. It had intense, opaque pigmentation in one layer, but the consistency was a little thicker but still on the more fluid side, so it felt harder to control the color on my lips. I‚Äôd recommend wiping away some of the product on the edge of the tube before applying as a full pull of product seemed to be overkill. Luckily, the liquid lipstick applied evenly despite not knowing that initially, though it took longer to dry down along the edges. It stayed on nicely for seven and a half hours and felt drying after five hours of wear.",A-
PHYSICIANS FORMULA,PEARL,Highlighter,"a soft white with subtle, warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It was richly pigmented and yielded a smooth, high-shine finish on my skin. The consistency felt slightly wet to the touch, was creamy and smooth, and easy to work with on my skin (both over bare skin as well as over foundation). The added slip helped it slide over my skin with ease without losing intensity or coverage. It never made my skin look more textured. The highlighter wore well for nine hours on me before fading slightly.",A+
BITE BEAUTY,KOHLRABI,Lipstick,"a deep purple with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. It had good pigmentation, but it wasn‚Äôt opaque in a single layer, and I had a difficult time trying to build it up with it starting to feel heavy. The consistency was smooth but a bit thinner with more slip compared to other shades in the line-up. The color could have applied more evenly, though it did not sit in my lip l ines. It lasted for five and a half hours and was moisturizing while worn.",B
BITE BEAUTY,LOTUS ROOT,Lipstick,"a bright, bubblegum pink with cool, blue undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. The color payoff was fantastic, and the texture was smooth, creamy without being heavy, and easy to spread across my lips with even coverage. It applied well and there was just a slight amount of product in my deeper lip lines, but it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The color wore well for five hours and was hydrating over time.",A
TOO FACED,UNICORN TEARS,Lipstick,"a pale, iridescent blue with lots of shimmer and larger sparkle with a color-changing base that tinted my lips fuchsia. It had a lot of shimmer and sparkle, but it also had larger particles, which had a tendency to clump up on my lips as I applied the color, so it made my lips appear more uneven with respect to texture. The color did not apply evenly, and there was faint color in my lip lines. It lasted for four and a half hours but separated while worn as the consistency was quite slippery. The formula felt lightly hydrating, though!",C-
TOO FACED,UNICORN TEARS,Lipgloss,"a pale, bluish-white base with pink-to-violet pearl. It had semi-sheer pigmentation that applied somewhat evenly but settled into my lip lines a bit more noticeably compared to other shades in the range. The consistency was lightweight, smooth, and a bit thin, so it did not have a plush, ultra-glossy look and feel on my lips. The color stayed on well for two and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing over time. It had a tendency to turn other lip colors underneath milky, so it wasn‚Äôt the easiest to work with as a layering product.",B-
SMASHBOX,NUDIE PIC (MEDIUM),Palette,"a warm-toned, neutral trio featuring a light beige, light brown, and mid-tone brown with matte finishes. All three were a waste of time and money‚Äìfor matte neutrals, there are so many better products out there. The type of experience I had using this trio is nowhere near what I‚Äôd expect for mid-end pricing.",F
COLOUR POP,JUST FOR US,Highlighter,"a soft, pastel pink with strong, warm undertones and multi-colored pearl and slightly larger sparkle. It had good pigmentation in a single layer, and it yielded a strong, luminous finish on the skin that wasn‚Äôt metallic but still plenty reflective. The underlying powder was more matte, so it did not seem to add a lot of shine, just helped given the highlighter a more uniform base to work with. It had a soft, finely-milled consistency that was easy to blend out on my skin. This shade stayed on well for eight hours before fading slightly.",A-
VISEART,PETIT PRO (02),Palette,"new, eight-pan palette with four matte shades and four shimmery shades. I usually find Viseart‚Äôs quality to be on the higher side, and occasionally, their ‚Äúmisses‚Äù will be less-pigmented matte shades, but they‚Äôll be very buildable and easy to work with, but I had one matte shade here (#4) that was terrible and one shimmer that was beyond dismal.",C+
SEPHORA,PINEAPPLE EXPRESS (21),Lipstick,"medium purple with warm, pink undertones and a cream finish. The lipstick was richly pigmented, while the texture was smooth, creamy, and had moderate slip, which made it comfortable to apply as it did not drag. For as much slip as it had, it didn‚Äôt well into my lip lines as I expected, though it slid around a touch (but did not feather on me). It lasted for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A
SEPHORA,A LITTLE MAGIC (22),Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark red with neutral-to-cool undertones and a satin finish. It had good pigmentation in a single layer with a smooth, lightly creamy texture that was a touch thinner but still applied easily across my lips. This shade wore well for six hours, left a subtle stain behind, and was slightly moisturizing.",A
SEPHORA,AFTER HOURS (23),Lipstick,"a deep red with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. The color payoff was nearly opaque in a single layer, and the color went on evenly and smoothly across my lips without tugging. The texture was smooth, creamy without being too slippery, and comfortable to wear over the five hours it lasted for. It was lightly hydrating over time.",A
COLOUR POP,HIT REWIND,Highlighter,"a muted, medium-dark rosy p ink with warm undertones and a coppery gold pearl. The consistency was finely-milled and very soft, but it was a bit harder to diffuse and blend out as I felt like it stuck too easily to my skin (without wanting to disperse) due to how easily it absorbed any natural oils on my skin. I used a larger, buffing brush to diffuse and soften the edges, but the coverage definitely suffered and looked more softly luminous than intense as it had initially. This one was better applied in layers, which helped to build up coverage and shine without making for a miserable blending experience. It had good pigmentation, and I‚Äôd agree that a little went a long way. On me, it wore well for eight and a half hours.",B
ANASTASIA,BOHEMIAN,Lipstick,"a deep burgundy with subtle, warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. It was richly pigmented and had a smooth, fluid consistency that wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin, but it seemed to run a little too easily, which made controlling application along the edges of my lips more of a challenge. I felt like it was fairly doable, but the formula definitely moved very easily and with the pigmentation, required some care. It wore well for almost eight hours but was a touch drying after five hours of wear.",A-
ANASTASIA,GRIM,Lipstick,"a medium taupe with a purplish leaning paired with a flat, matte finish. It had opaque color coverage in a single layer with a smooth, light-medium thick texture that was rather fluid but fairly easy to maneuver along the edges of my lips with. I noticed that after the liquid lipstick dried down, the finish was a little dusty or powdery to the touch. It lasted for seven hours but did fade a bit unevenly compared to other shades in this formula (which I find is a little more common with a powdery dry down) and felt a bit drying after four hours of wear.",B+
KAT VON D,I AM DIVINE,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette featuring eight eyeshadows with a mix of mattes and shimmers. It‚Äôs certainly a fun color scheme that isn‚Äôt something we‚Äôve seen over and over again, but the execution of some of the shades here (like Hard Magic, the matte black, and Female Trouble, the matte white) was tragic.",C
NARS,R√™VE SAL√©,Palette,"contains a soft gold, light peach, and light copper housed in a slim palette. All three shades were pigmented and more luminous, though the first shade could be worn as a subtle to moderate highlighter while the other two were fairly metallic. The wear time was between eight and nine hours.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,SOLEIL D'AMBRE,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette that contains four eyeshadows and two cheek colors (one blush, one highlighter). The highlighter stood out above all the other shades in the palette, which were more so-so and just not high-performing enough to be impressive.",B-
TOO FACED,MERMAID TEARS,Lipstick,"a dirty, almost gray-ish plum base with pink and green pearl. It ended up looking like a muted, blackened plum on my lips with multi-colored pearl and a lightly, glossy sheen. It had medium coverage that applied evenly and stayed out of my lip lines. The lipstick was smooth, creamy, and very emollient, so it did feel a bit slippery on my lips, though it was quite comfortable and hydrating over the three hours it wore for.",B
TOO FACED,MERMAID TEARS,Lipgloss,"a bright, light-medium green with warmer, yellow undertones and cooler blue and green sparkle. This shade seemed to have larger particles as well as finer pearl. It had very sheer coverage, though, and it applied somewhat unevenly. I found that this one seemed to be a bit more transformative as the shimmer particles were more contrasting with most lip colors. It lasted for two hours on me and was lightly moisturizing to wear.",C
COLOUR POP,CHILL PILL,Highlighter,"a light pink with subtle, warm undertones and multi-colored pearl. It had more of a ‚Äúmatte‚Äù base powder and finer pearl, so it ended up having a more subtle finish than the original Luster Dusts. I think anyone who prefers a soft glow will find it to their liking, but if you want something intense or shiny, look elsewhere. It had semi-sheer, buildable pigmentation when I swatched it on my arm, but when I applied it with a tapered highlighting blush, just one tap into the pot seemed to yield semi-opaque coverage.",B+
TOO FACED,UNICORN DREAMS,Highlighter,"a light pink with subtle, warm undertones and much warmer, peachy gold pearl. It had a soft, natural sheen on my skin and a bit of color. It had semi-sheer pigmentation, which was somewhat buildable to medium coverage.",B
BITE BEAUTY,ARROWROOT,Lipstick,"a medium copper with warm, orange undertones and a creamy finish. The consistency was smooth, fluid without being runny, and easy to work with for even, opaque color payoff. It was comfortable to wear and took three to four hours to wear down to a more satin finish. This shade stayed on well for almost six hours and was hydrating over time.",A+
BITE BEAUTY,CASSAVA,Lipstick,"a deep, reddish plum with subtle, cool undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, and the fluid, smooth consistency applied the product evenly with little work. The texture was comfortable to wear and smoothed out my lip lines instead of filling them. It wore beautifully for over six hours and was moisturizing while worn.",A
BITE BEAUTY,CHICORY,Lipstick,"a medium, rosy brown with warm undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. The liquid lipstick had a smooth, creamy, and fluid consistency‚Äìnot too thin or too thick‚Äìthat was spreadable across my lips for even and opaque color payoff in one layer. It wore well for five and a half hours and was nicely hydrating.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,ME122 SNOW,Eyeshadow,"a bright white with neutral-to-cool undertones and a metallic finish. It had good color payoff in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with a second layer on top. The consistency was soft, smooth, and dense but not stiff or difficult to pickup with a brush. The eyeshadow blended out nicely and stayed on well for nine hours on me.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,ME202 ICEBERG BLUE,Eyeshadow,"a pale, bluish silver with cool undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly to bare skin, but it had larger sparkle and was harder to build up without using a dampened brush or primer underneath it. The consistency was a touch drier compared to other Metallic shades in the range, but it blended out fairly well. It lasted for nine and a half hours on me before fading noticeably but had some fallout over time.",B-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,ME108 STEEL,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark gray with cooler undertones and a metallic finish. The texture was denser and a bit drier, which resulted in more ragged edges when it came time to diffuse and blend the eyeshadow out on my lid. It had good color payoff but definitely required a heavier hand and flat, synthetic brushes for best results. It wore well for nine and a half hours before fading slightly on me.",B-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M106 SLATE,Eyeshadow,"a deep, bluish gray with a matte finish. The eyeshadow had a soft, lightly powdery consistency in the pan that had felt velvety to the touch. It had medium coverage but was buildable, which I think made it easier to work with as it blended out without a lot of effort, but some will want greater pigmentation without the effort. This shade wore well for nine hours on me.",C+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M226 ABYSSAL BLUE,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark blue with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that applied fairly evenly to bare skin and blended out easily. Over time, I have found that I prefer more buildable, deeper matte shades like this, but it‚Äôs certainly not advertised that way. The texture was smooth and velvety to the touch but was a little powdery when I used it. The color stayed on well for nine and a half hours on me.",B-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,ME116 SILVER,Eyeshadow,"a medium silver with subtle, neutral-to-cool undertones and a pearly sheen. The pigmentation was good, while the texture was smooth, lightly creamy, and moderately dense. It worked best with flat, synthetic brushes using a pushing and pulling method to dislodge product and to apply to the lid (again, common technique for denser, more silicone-heavy formulations in my experience). It applied evenly to my lid and blended out nicely. This shade wore well for nine and a half hours on me.",B+
PHYSICIANS FORMULA,CHAMPAGNE,Highlighter,"a light-medium gold with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation with a smooth, creamy consistency that was slightly wet to the touch in the pot, but it did not feel wet once I applied it to my cheek bones. I liked using my fingertips for application, as it remained blendable and easy to work with that way, but brushes or sponges could be used (the latter will yield the most subtle of finishes). It had a strong, noticeable shine but did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. It wore well for nine and a half hours.",A
TOO FACED,UNICORN TEARS,Highlighter,"a pale beige base with iridescent blue-to-violet shifting pearl. The shift was visible (more so in person) but the overall effect was subtle, as the product was designed to be more buildable and on the less intense side as far as highlighters can go.",B-
TOO FACED,ANGEL TEARS,Lipstick,"a light, pinky-peach with fine gold and lavender pearl and a touch of larger sparkle. It had semi-sheer pigmentation that applied somewhat evenly, but the bits of sparkle tended to bunch up sometimes on any imperfections I had on my lips. I didn‚Äôt notice this one staining, and it only lasted for two hours on me, but it was hydrating.",C-
TOO FACED,ANGEL TEARS,Lipgloss,"a light, warm beige base with fine, peach-to-pink shifting pearl. It had sheer coverage with moderate shimmer with a lightly glossy finish (not what I‚Äôd call ‚Äúsuper-gloss,‚Äù though). While it was rather light in color, it did not settle too badly into my lip lines. It lasted for two hours and was lightly hydrating. This shade did not seem to do much in the way of transforming other lip colors, though.",B-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,SUGAR AND SPICE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark plum with soft, warm undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was incredibly rich and covered my lips with smooth, even color payoff in a single, fluid stroke. It felt creamy going onto my lips but wasn‚Äôt overly emollient or slippery, so it adhered well and stayed in place without feathering. This shade wore well for six and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing, which is great wear in the grand scheme of things but still quite short of the brand‚Äôs 10-hour wear claim, unfortunately!",A-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,VINYL DREAM,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark purple with warm, pink undertones and a satin finish. It had opaque pigmentation in a single layer, while the consistency was smooth, lightly creamy, and comfortable to apply. The color applied beautifully with even coverage and didn‚Äôt emphasize my lip lines. It stayed on well for six hours, left a faint stain behind, and was lightly moisturizing.",B+
NARS,COUCHER DE SOLEIL,Palette,"a rich gold, medium copper, and dark plum with frosted to metallic finishes. All three were rather pigmented with smooth, blendable textures that were easy to work with on my skin. They lasted for eight and a half hours on me, too, which was great to see.",B+
HUDA BEAUTY,BRONZE SANDS,Palette,"one cream highlighter and three powder highlighters in warmer, richer hues (the palette is designed for deeper skin tones, but it could certainly be used by a variety in skin tones depending on one‚Äôs preferences!). I enjoyed the three powder highlighters but found the cream highlighter to be too tacky to be ideal‚Äìit had a tendency to lift base products and was harder to spread out evenly due to the tackiness in texture.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,PISCES,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark coral-orange with warm undertones and a cream finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, while the consistency was smooth, lightweight, and creamy with a touch of tackiness, which helped the product adhere well to lips and last longer. It felt comfortable to wear over the five and a half hours it lasted for, and the formula was moisturizing over time.",A
SEPHORA,GOLDEN GATE (31),Lipstick,"a deep, muted plum with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, while the lipstick applied fluidly across my lips and delivered even coverage. It had a lightly creamy, smooth consistency that wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thick, so it sat well on my lips and did not emphasize my lip lines. It wore well for five and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing over time.",A+
SEPHORA,BERRY-LICIOUS (32),Lipstick,"a deep, purple-berry with warmer undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that did not build up to full coverage. The consistency was creamy with heavy slip, so it had a tendency to slide around on my lips during wear, though I did not experience any feathering. It lasted for five hours, was hydrating, and left a faint stain behind.",B+
SEPHORA,TAKE A BITE (35),Lipstick,"a bright, medium coral-red with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had good color payoff, but the lipstick seemed to separate a bit on my lips along my lip lines and did not appear as smooth as other shades in the range. The lipstick had a smooth, lightly creamy consistency that glided on with ease, so I‚Äôm not sure why it didn‚Äôt look as good when all was said and done. It wore well for five hours and was moisturizing over time.",B+
TOO FACED,UNICORN TEARS,Palette,"a new, limited edition highlighter-and-bronzer duo that‚Äôs definitely easier to use together than separately, but with the right brushes, the two can be used separately if desired. I found that the highlighter did not impact the color of the bronzer much at all, just added violet sparkle on top (which was hardly noticeable once blended out). The powder had a sweet scent to it.",B
SEPHORA,TAN LINES (06),Lipstick,"a medium peach with warm, orange undertones and a glossy finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation covered my lips evenly for the most part, but it had very slight streaking along the edges, though I couldn‚Äôt see it in person (just in my close-up photos!). The lipstick had an emollient, slightly slippery texture, which made it comfortable to glide across my lips, but I could feel it moving around over the three and a half hours it lasted for. It was lightly hydrating, though.",B
SEPHORA,LOVE LOVE (07),Lipstick,"a medium beige with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It looked more matte after an hour or so of wear. The consistency was creamy, smooth, and comfortable to work with but was a bit thicker compared to most shades in the formula. The pigmentation was opaque, and it covered my lips fairly evenly but had a bit of product get into my lower lip lines. This shade stayed on well for four and a half hours, but I continued to see lip liner pull into my deeper lip lines over time. It didn‚Äôt seem hydrating, but it wasn‚Äôt drying either.",B+
SEPHORA,LABYRINTH CITY (09),Lipstick,"a medium-dark, reddish plum with warm undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was fantastic‚Äìcompletely opaque in one stroke‚Äìand covered my lips evenly. The consistency was smooth, velvety, and had enough creaminess not to drag on my lips during application but still felt comfortable to wear. It wore well for five hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.",A
MILANI,HOLOGRAPHIC BEAMS,Palette,"a beige with a pink-to-violet duochrome sheen, iridescent bluish-white, and a rich orange. I wish they had opted for a cooler plum or lavender instead of the orange, as it would have made it a cool-toned complement to the Rosy Glow trio (which is definitely all warm-toned!). I liked the trio, and all three shades were easy to apply and blend out, but two of the three shades weren‚Äôt ‚Äúrichly pigmented‚Äù as described.",B+
STILA,PAINTED LADY,Highlighter,"a translucent base with finger copper flecks of sparkle and larger pink and gold glitter. It had a subtle shift from pink to gold from some of the sparkles. It was difficult to tell I had any product applied if I wasn‚Äôt staring at myself a few inches away in a mirror. This was one that I did not think could be worn alone (which the brand says is one way to use this formula!), and it was somewhat more interesting over another highlighter or blush color, but it was still pretty minimal.",D
ANASTASIA,SOFT GLAM,Palette,"a new, warm-toned neutral palette with mix of mattes and s himmers. There are several shades repeated from the permanent line (Orange Soda, Dusty Rose, Sienna, Noir as well as the Modern Renaissance palette (Tempera, Burnt Orange, Cyprus Umber), so those who have a more extensive stash of the brand‚Äôs neutral shades may find there‚Äôs quite a bit overlap. I expect that it will work well as a go-to palette for some and others will find too many dupes within their collections already.",B+
SEPHORA,SPRING BREAK (36),Lipstick,"a medium, rosy plum with warm undertones and a cream finish. The lipstick had opaque pigmentation in a single layer and applied evenly and smoothly across my lips. It had a lightweight, creamy texture with some slip, but it adhered well to my lips and stayed on for four and a half hours. It was lightly hydrating while worn.",A
SEPHORA,HOT IN HAVANA (37),Lipstick,"a medium-dark orange with warm undertones and a cream finish. This one ended up applying more mutedly on my lips than when I just swatched it, though I‚Äôd say it looked a bit brighter in person to my eye. It had good color payoff in one fluid stroke, but it did not apply quite as evenly as other shades and pulled away at my lip lines a bit. The consistency lightweight, creamy, and had moderate slip that made it comfortable to apply and to wear. I found the formula to feel lightly moisturizing over the four and a half hours it wore well for.",B+
SEPHORA,OFF-LIMITS (38),Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark lavender with warm undertones and a satin finish. The color payoff was opaque in one layer, and the color went on evenly across my lips and did not tug, but there was a bit of product that seemed to sit in my lip lines. It had a velvety, smooth consistency that wasn‚Äôt as ‚Äúwet‚Äù in feel compared to most shades in the range. The lipstick stayed on well for five hours, and it looked more matte within an hour and a half of wear. It felt lightly hydrating while I wore it.",A-
STILA,MONARCH,Highlighter,"light, icy lavender with multi-colored sparkle and pearl. This shade had a sheerer base but seemed to be very illuminating on the skin and looked almost opaque‚Äìa little went a long way. It had a thin, watery texture that dried down quite fast, so I had to work quickly, and it clumped a bit in places and emphasized my skin‚Äôs natural texture at times. The finish was sparkling and almost metallic, but it did not have as much dimension from a normal viewing distance, just occasionally when I looked close-up and tilted my face. It was a bit more apparent when layered over something pink or purple (like a blush).",C-
MAKEUP REVOLUTION,LIQUID ETHEREAL,Highlighter,"a soft pink with subtle, warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It seemed almost metallic when worn heavily, but from sheer to semi-opaque coverage levels, it was luminous and glowing without appearing overtly shimmery. The consistency was lightweight, fluid, and thin but not too watery, so it spread evenly across my cheekbones but did not lose its sheen or pigmentation (except as I wanted it to!). It was easy to work with on top of liquid foundation, bare skin, or mixed in with foundation or moisturizer. It wore well on my cheekbones (as a standalone product) for nine hours.",A
KAT VON D,OPHELIA,Lipstick,"a muted, medium peach with warm undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was opaque in one layer, but the consistency was soft enough not to drag on my lips but did take stronger pressure to get it to go on in a fluid motion. It wore well for four and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
KAT VON D,LUDWIG,Lipstick,"a muted, medium pink with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied with just slight tugging, but the color itself went on evenly. There was a touch of product in my deeper lip lines, but I didn‚Äôt see it from a normal viewing distance. The consistency was denser but fairly smooth, and it didn‚Äôt feel clingy. It wore well for four and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
KAT VON D,LOVECRAFT,Lipstick,"medium-dark pink with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. The texture was slightly firm and dense, and it tugged a bit on my lips while I tried to apply it in a fluid stroke, but it wasn‚Äôt as bad as other shades in the line. It had nearly opaque color payoff that applied evenly. This shade stayed on nicely for five hours but was a bit drying.",B+
LAURA GELLER,PIXIE PEARL,Highlighter,"a very light pink with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. The powder had a smooth, almost cream-like consistency as it was denser but not stiff or firmly pressed in the pan. It had semi-opaque color payoff that was buildable to full coverage with a second layer if desired (though the brand describes as sheer). I had no trouble blending out the powder on my cheek bones, and the highlighter illuminated without emphasizing my skin‚Äôs natural texture. The powder stayed on well for nine hours on me.",A
VISEART,TRYST,Palette,"a new, limited edition eyeshadow palette that is exclusive to Beautylish. Overall, it‚Äôs a nice palette that I expect will make a good ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù palette for some. Darling could have been more pigmented and had a creamier consistency, while Dangereuse and Illicit had room for minor improvement.",A-
SEPHORA,TWOLIPS (14),Lipstick,"a bright, medium fuchsia pink with cooler undertones and a cream finish. The pigmentation was good, but the application wasn‚Äôt as even as other shades, and I noticed that this particular shade seemed to adhere less smoothly. The texture was creamy with moderate slip, which might have been why the application wasn‚Äôt as good as other colors in the formula. This sahde wore well for four and a half hours but settled into lip lines a bit, left behind a slight stain, and was lightly hydrating.",B
SEPHORA,WANDERLUST (33),Lipstick,"a deep burgundy with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had a soft sheen that mattified within an hour of wear. The texture was smooth, lightweight, and creamy enough to glide on easily but not enough to feather on me (though I‚Äôm not prone to feathering). It had good pigmentation but did not have full coverage in a single layer, and the color itself went on fairly evenly. The lipstick stayed on well for five hours and left a subtle stain behind, while the formula was lightly moisturizing.",B+
SEPHORA,YUM YUM (10),Lipstick,"a medium-dark plummy brown withw arm undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a smooth, creamy consistency that wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin and had a moderate amount of slip. The color went on evenly and didn‚Äôt emphasize my lip lines. It wore well for four and a half hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",A
STILA,ADMIRAL,Highlighter,"a translucent base with fine, mint green pearl and larger flecks of blue, green, and pink sparkle/glitter. It had sheer coverage, as described, with a light amount of glitter ‚Äúcoverage,‚Äù but it did not look like much on its own. There was a subtle illumination, but up-close, it looked more like specks of sand than truly sparkly to my eye (which can sometimes occur with sparser or larger-sized glitter-based products).",C
TOM FORD BEAUTY,AURORA,Lipstick,"a soft, translucent base that seemed to have a subtle, lavender tint. On my lips, the tint translated to a deepening of my natural lip color and made it appear more mauve/cooler compared to normal. The consistency was lightweight, balmy, and emollient with moderate slip, so it was comfortable to apply and to wear. The product only seemed to stay on my lips for an hour and a half to two hours, and I didn’t feel sustained hydration over time.
",B-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,GLIMMER,Lipstick,"a soft, translucent base that seems very subtly peach-tinted, but against my warmer skin tones, that tint seems to get completely lost. When applied to my lips and left for 15 minutes, it deepens my natural lip color and gives a soft, natural shine. I didn’t find that this shade differenced noticeably from the original, Universel, shade or the Rougir shade. Aurora runs ever-so-slightly cooler on. The formula lasted an hour and a half hour on me before it felt like it had absorbed or else disappeared, but I expected it to feel more hydrating during and after–I just felt the need for more balm/hydration after it had worn down.",B-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,LIQUID SKY,Highlighter,"a translucent, soft gold with fine pearl. The consistency was a thinner, watery gel that was spreadable with enough slip that it had more substance than pure water. As a standalone highlighter, it added soft shine with fine, but a healthy amount of, shimmer, and a hint of warmth to my cheekbones. I used my fingertips to pat the product onto my cheek bones and gently diffused with a duo-fiber cheek brush. When I tried testing it over a liquid foundation, it did not seem to lift up my base if I was gentle and careful, but if I used my fingertips, I felt like there was a bit of lifting.

I liked it mixed in with my liquid foundation to give a dewier finish to my base, though I did not see it add any noticeable tint/warmth to my base (but someone who is very pale might see it come through). As far as liquid highlighters go, this was one of the more “potent” options in terms of amount of shimmer packed in each droplet. It dried to a more powder-like finish (didn’t feel tacky, nor did it feel clingy on my skin) within 30 seconds of blending and diffusing the product out on my skin. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before fading noticeably.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,STAR LIT,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette that features six glittery eyeshadows. The formula is different from other finishes from the brand within the Artist Color Shadow range (and its previous Artist Shadow range as well), but it’s one that other brands have used in some capacity (Urban Decay Moondusts, Tom Ford/Charlotte Tilbury both have similar formulations in various palettes, MAC Dazzleshadow, etc.), though I’d argue the Star Lit formula’s strength is pigmentation with moderate glitter/sparkle rather than lots of glitter/sparkle and less base color. This makes them workable as layering shades as well as standalone eyeshadows. There were two shades that were sheerer, while four were quite pigmented, and that was where the palette lost points (as the brand states these have “intense color payoff”).

The texture has a smoother, almost wet feel with some slip and enough substance that the glitter and base color adhere together onto the lid without lots of fallout during blending or application. These types of sparkles tend to lay flat and stick well to the skin, but they can be harder to remove at the end of the day, and there was some migration over time, though certainly not tons and still impressive for something as glittery as this formula without using an adhesive base or spray. I swatched all the shades dry and damp, and I found dampened application to be largely unnecessary.

One thing note is that each shade doesn’t contain as much product as you’d think, given the size of the palette. It has that bulky, oversized feel, which may be a deal-breaker for some and a non-issue for others!",B+
SMASHBOX,PUNKED,Palette,"a bright silver, dark taupe, and dark black housed in a circular, plastic compact. The three shades were definitely a good color scheme together, but again, the quality of the formula used in the trio had room for improvement.",B
KAT VON D,SANCTUARY,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark mauve with neutral-to-warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which wasn’t buildable, that applied evenly with minimal color that gathered in my deeper lip lines (and wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance). The texture was smooth with a touch of slip, so it didn’t drag on my lips like most shades have in this formula. It wore well four hours and was non-drying.",B
KAT VON D,OG LOLITA,Lipstick,"a medium, pink-coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had good color payoff in a single layer, though it wasn’t opaque and did not build up to full coverage with additional product. The consistency was drier, firm, and dense in the tube, so there was some dragging on my lips as I tried to apply it in a fluid motion–short strokes were best to minimize unevenness in the application. The color stayed on well for four hours and pulled into my lip lines noticeably after two hours of wear, while the formula felt a bit drying overall.",B-
KAT VON D,LOLITA II,Lipstick,"a medium, muted coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had opaque pigmentation that applied evenly, but it did have a tendency to separate around and get into my lip lines, so it wasn’t the most flattering of finishes on my lips. The texture was lightweight, looked creamier on than it felt going on, as the denser formula still tugged a bit during application for me. It wore well for five hours and was slightly drying.",B
BECCA COSMETICS,PARISIAN LIGHTS,Highlighter,"a soft, very light pink with subtle, warm undertones and a warm, peachy gold shimmer that gave it a more metallic sheen on the skin. It looked peachier at times, especially when buffed and blended out on my cheekbones (I’m also warmer-toned). The pink base will likely be more prominent on cooler and/or lighter complexions as it did have good color payoff (not quite opaque, though). The finish did not emphasize my skin’s natural texture.

The texture was smooth, soft, but not quite as creamy as other highlighters from the brand, though it had no meaningful impact on application or wear, as it blended out easily and lasted for eight and a half hours on me.

It’s a new, limited edition shade that launches on February 19th on Beautylish, as well as on Cult Beauty and Becca.",A-
SEPHORA,TAKE A SPIN (41),Lipstick,"a soft, medium beige with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. It had better pigmentation that I expected (almost opaque), but it had a lot of slip and the particle size of the glitter/sparkle seemed prone to making the color clump up on those particles rather than adhere to my lips evenly. The end result was a clumpy, patchy application that did not look good. It worked better layered over another product with a lip brush or fingertip. It wore well for three and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",D-
SEPHORA,NO CELL SERVICE (42),Lipstick,"a medium, golden copper with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque color payoff in a single layer, and the lipstick applied fairly evenly across my lips and was comfortable to wear. The texture felt smooth, lightly emollient but not too slippery, and the shimmer dispersed well over my lips. It lasted for four hours and was lightly moisturizing.",B+
SEPHORA,IN THE CLOUDS (43),Lipstick,"a birhgt white with neutral-to-cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It went totally matte within an hour of wear. The texture was smooth, velvety, and not overly emollient, but it didn’t tug or pull on my lips when applied directly from the tube. It had good pigmentation, but it wasn’t opaque, and this type of color is hard to do right unless it’s opaque. The consistency was just right for mixing in with other lip products, though, as it wasn’t too thick or too creamy, but it also wasn’t firm, dense, or dry. On its own, it wore well for four hours but pulled into my lip lines over time. It felt neither drying nor hydrating.",B
URBAN DECAY,NAKED PETITE HEAT,Palette,"a new, travel-friendly warm-toned palette with five mattes and one shimmer. It launches on February 22nd on urbandecay.com and will be in-stores the first week of March.",B+
COLOURED RAINE,CHEERS TO THE BEAUTY,Palette,"a large palette that contains 12 eyeshadows and one highlighter. Almost every shade had rich color payoff, while most were blendable and easy to use with good wear (without primer). I think the palette worked best when I incorporated some softer, lighter and more mid-tone shades, particularly when working with some of the cooler-toned shimmery shades in the palette, but it could definitely be used together for a cohesive look if one enjoys dramatic and more contrasting color combinations.",A-
KAT VON D,LOLITA,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark pink with warmer undertones and a semi-matte finish. The color payoff was fantastic‚Äìactually opaque!‚Äìwith a dense consistency that was smooth, velvety, and lightweight and had just enough slip to apply without dragging on my lips. It wore well for five and a half hours but was a bit drying after four hours of wear.",A-
KAT VON D,CATHEDRAL,Lipstick,"a medium-dark plum with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had intense pigmentation in a single layer, which applied evenly and smoothly across my lips with just a touch of tugging. The lipstick had a smooth consistency that was lightweight, thin but not clingy, and was fairly easy to work with. It lasted for five and a half hours but felt a bit drying after four hours of wear.",A-
KAT VON D,NAHZ FUR ATOO,Lipstick,"a deep red with warmer undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was good, though it wasn‚Äôt opaque and never built up to it (would need a liner to go the whole way). The consistency was dense and firm, though it wasn‚Äôt painful to use as it dragged on the lips somewhat. The color went on fairly evenly and didn‚Äôt seem as keen to getting into my lip l ines as other shades. It was still going strong after six hours and left a stain behind, but the formula was somewhat drying on me after four hours of wear.",B
MAC,VIVA GLAM SIA,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark red with neutral-to-cool undertones and a matte finish. MAC described it as a ‚Äúwarm‚Äù red, though it looked cooler on me and occasionally, neutral, but it had a pinkish base when I sheered it out.",A
SEPHORA,FIRE SIDE (11),Lipstick,"a deep brown with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had opaque color payoff that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips and never tugged during application. The lipstick had a lightweight, creamy (but not slippery!) consistency that had a bit of substance to it so it seemed to smooth out most of my lip lines. It stayed on nicely for five hours and was lightly moisturizing.",A
SEPHORA,CELEBRATE (12),Lipstick,"a deep magenta with cool, blue undertones and a cream finish. It had good pigmentation in a single layer, though it wasn‚Äôt opaque and did not build up to full coverage either. The consistency was smooth, creamy without being too slippery, and easy to glide across my lips in a fluid stroke, but there was something about the texture that seemed to pull away along my lip lines, which made the color look less even as a result. It wore well for five hours and left a heavy stain behind. The formula felt lightly hydrating while worn.",B
SEPHORA,COCONUT GROVE (13),Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with subtle, cooler undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-sheer pigmentation‚Äìenough color to tint my natural lip color and a moderate amount of sparkle and pearl‚Äìbut it had moderate slip, which made it hard to build up coverage. If you‚Äôre someone who likes sheerer, shimmery lipsticks, it might still work for you. The texture was lightweight, emollient but not heavy, and I could feel a bit of the texture of the sparkles in the tube, but it did not feel rough or scratchy overall. It wore well for four hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",C+
MAC,LO-FI,Palette,"an example where there‚Äôs a lot of attention paid to the packaging but not enough toward the actual product inside. I like the concept, and one thought to solve the ‚Äúwasted space‚Äù aspect of the palette would have been to made a hinged lid (that was black) that hid additional shades, so you could get the visual effect while providing more shades (perhaps making each pan a little bigger).",D
KAT VON D,HAWKWIND,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark plummy-brown with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had opaque pigmentation with a smooth, lightweight texture that had just enough slip to glide on with only slight tugging (which is, frankly, a big improvement for this formula!). The color applied evenly on my lips, stayed on for five hours, and was non-drying.",A-
KAT VON D,CRUCIFIX,Lipstick,"a deep brown with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. The color payoff was semi-opaque and did not build up to full coverage, which may have been partially due to the firmer, denser consistency that made it hard to apply as the lipstick dragged and tugged on my lips from start to finish. I really had to use a fair amount of pressure just to get an even layer of product overall. The shade lasted for five hours, was drying over time, and had some color that settled into my lip lines.",D
KAT VON D,PIAF,Lipstick,"a muted, dark plum-brown with warmer undertones and flecks of multi-colored pearl and slightly larger, glitter particles. It had semi-sheer pigmentation that applied unevenly and settled into lip lines noticeably. The texture was very firm, stiff, and dense in the tube, which made it painful to apply as the pressure needed was great and it just tugged and dragged the whole time. It never seemed to soften or improve with repeated use. It lasted for four and a half hours and was drying over time.",F
MILANI,FLASHING LIGHTS,Highlighter,"a light-medium pink with warm undertones and a gold-to-orange shifting shimmer. It had a luminous finish on my skin‚Äìglowing but not overtly shimmery or metallic‚Äìso it was easy to apply and never have to worry about emphasizing my skin‚Äôs natural texture. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation. On my complexion, it was a subtle highlighter and blusher. The powder was smooth, soft without being powdery, and blendable. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.",A-
SMASHBOX,NUDIE PIC (DEEP),Palette,"matte eyeshadows in warm peach, muted copper, and deep brown. I love the color concept but wish the execution was better for the lightest shade (quite powdery) and the deepest shade was a bit more blendable. I definitely appreciate that Smashbox came out with multiple variations on ‚Äúbasic neutrals‚Äù by skin tone, too.",C+
SEPHORA,BRUNCH DATE (01),Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark peachy brown with soft, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good color coverage, though it was shy of full coverage, and I could see my lip freckle peeking through. The texture was smooth, velvety, and a little thin but not clingy. It seemed to pull into my lip lines a little bit more than other shades in the line, and it also had more of a matte finish within an hour. It wore well for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
SEPHORA,OUI (03),Lipstick,"a muted, medium pink with soft, warm undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was very nearly opaque in a single layer, but better yet, the color went on evenly across my lips without tugging or streaking. The texture was lightweight, lightly creamy but not overly slippery, and felt hydrating over the four hours it lasted for.",A-
SEPHORA,SOMEWHERE IN SPAIN (04),Lipstick,"a light-medium peach with strong, warm yellow undertones and a glossy, cream finish. It had nearly opaque color payoff in a single layer, and the color applied evenly across the lips despite having a moderate amount of slip. The consistency was lightweight, creamy, and glided on with ease. There was a smidgen of color that gathered in my deeper lip lines, but I was impressed at how minimal it was given the lightness and glossiness of the shade. It wore well for three and a half hours on me and was lightly hydrating over time.",B+
JOUER,COQUETTE,Palette,"a deep plum and light, cool pink. The two shades complement each other well, and you could mix and layer to get the exact shade of pink-plum you desire. They both were pigmented and long-wearing and were fairly easy to blend out on my cheeks.",A-
GIVENCHY,ROUGE STILETTO,Lipstick,"a medium-dark red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. The color payoff was good but shy of full coverage (as described). The lipstick felt velvety and smooth as it glided across my lips with ease, but it was a thinner formula and seemed a bit more prone to emphasizing my lip lines overall, though not as badly as other shades in the formula had done. It wore well for five hours, left barely any stain behind, and was lightly moisturizing over time.",A-
GIVENCHY,VIOLINE RETRO,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, purple-berry with subtle, cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied somewhat evenly, but the product had a tendency to catch on imperfections and appear clumpy there. The lipstick felt lightweight with a thin texture that wasn‚Äôt clingy. It felt smooth and glided easily across my lips, which made it comfortable and lightly hydrating over the four and a half hours it lasted for.",C+
SMASHBOX,ON LOCATION,Palette,"a warm beige, dark gold, and bright teal, but the quality of the formula fell short yet again. The combination was nice in concept so it‚Äôs a shame the execution was poor.",C
COLOUR POP,ON DISPLAY,Lipstick,"a deep red with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly on the lips. It had a smooth, creamy consistency that glided across my lips fluidly and was comfortable to wear (though not hydrating) over five and a half hours.",A
COLOUR POP,LIQUID COURAGE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, rusty red with warm undertones and a cream finish. The color payoff was fantastic‚Äìopaque in a single stroke‚Äìthat drenched lips in even, smooth color. The lipstick was smooth, creamy without being too slippery or thick, and glided on easily. It stayed on nicely for five and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",A
COLOUR POP,HELLO STRANGER,Lipstick,"a deep burgundy with cool undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips despite not being full coverage (and it did not build up either). The consistency was lightweight, creamy without being thick or heavy, and it was comfortable to wear. On me, it wore well for six hours, left a stain behind, and was lightly hydrating.",A
COLOUR POP,NKLA X LAURA LEE,Palette,"a limited edition set of shades where all net profits will be donated to the Best Friends Animal Society, and each shade can also be purchased individually (they‚Äôre $5 each). The four coordinated well with each other, and I was happy to see two more matte shades from ColourPop, as I love them as crease colors!",A
JOUER,FLIRT,Palette,"a rich, peony pink and a softer, light peach with a hint of pink. The lighter shade had some shimmer, which made it very easy to blend and apply on the skin, and it worked well to tone down the brightness of the richer pink if desired.",A-
GIVENCHY,NUDE ANDROGYNE,Lipstick," a muted, medium-dark coral with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered the lips fairly evenly. The lipstick had a thin, velvety texture (felt more like a silicone face primer than a typical lipstick!), which helped it glide nicely across the lips, but there was slight color that pulled into my deeper lip lines. It wore well for three and a half hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",B
GIVENCHY,POURPRE DEFILE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, burgundy red with cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. The color payoff was semi-opaque and not buildable to full coverage. The consistency was lightweight, thin but not clingy, and velvety with good glide yet did not feel slick or wet. It seemed to emphasize the texture of my lips and clumped in places. The color stayed on well for five hours and was lightly moisturizing.",B-
GIVENCHY,ROSE GRAPHIQUE,Lipstick,"a medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. The pigmentation wasn‚Äôt quite opaque as described, and it did not build up well. The texture felt thin but not clingy (or drying), but it was particularly unflattering as the color slipped into my lip lines and emphasized the texture of my lips noticeably. This shade wore well for three and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",C+
COLOUR POP,MIDNIGHT SNACK,Lipstick,"a light-medium, peachy coral with warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. It had good color coverage in a single layer, but it wasn‚Äôt quite opaque, which resulted in light, visible streaking in places. The liquid lipstick had a smooth, fluid consistency that spread well across my lips and dried down within 30 seconds without feeling clingy. It wore well for five hours and was lightly drying on me after four hours of wear.",B
COLOUR POP,UP ALL NIGHT,Lipstick,"a muted, medium brown with warm, rosy undertones and a flat, matte finish. It was richly pigmented and had a smooth, lightweight consistency that was fluid enough to spread easily and evenly across my lips, but it didn‚Äôt feel thick or take forever to dry down, which kept it from sinking into all my lip lines. There was slight settling in my deeper lip lines, which wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The color stayed on well for six hours and was lightly drying over time.",B+
COLOUR POP,WYD,Lipstick,"a medium-dark brown with warm, rosy undertones and a flat, matte finish. The texture was smooth, lightweight, and easy to work with to get even, opaque coverage in a single layer. It dried down within 30 seconds, but it felt a little clingy, so it wasn‚Äôt the most comfortable to wear. This shade lasted well for five and a half hours before fading more noticeably from the center of my lips. It felt a bit drying after four hours of wear.",B
SMASHBOX,NIGHT SHOOT,Palette,"a soft beige, dirty gold, and dark taupe-brown. I liked the color scheme they were going for here, and I think they can be used together as a single, cohesive look. The quality was better than most of the trios, but I‚Äôd still recommend primer as a must-have for the formula.",B+
COLOUR POP,BARDOT,Blush,"a deep copper with warm, red undertones and a pearl finish. It had opaque pigmentation when applied with fingertips and more medium, buildable color coverage when applied with a stippling brush. The consistency was smooth, slightly wet to the touch, but it had the same, spongy texture signature to the Super Shock formula that kept it a thinner formula that dried down to a powder-like finish after 15 to 30 seconds. The color blended out easily on my skin and yielded a luminous sheen that didn‚Äôt emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. It wore well for nine and a half hours and had barely faded.",A
JOUER,ADORE,Palette,"a darker, brighter peach and a light, peachy brown. Both blushes had semi-opaque or better pigmentation, eight-hour wear, and were fairly easy to apply.",B+
COLOUR POP,FOOLISH,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark copper with warm, red undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was very nearly opaque in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The texture was lightweight, thin without being too thin, and creamy enough not to tug on the lips but adhered evenly and did not slide around over time. There was some product that gathered in my lip lines, though it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance. It wore comfortably for the first three hours but started to feel a touch drying after four hours of wear with total wear around five hours.",A-
COLOUR POP,GALLOP,Lipstick,"a deep copper with warm undertones and a cream finish. It was richly pigmented and had a creamy, lightly emollient consistency that was a little denser compared to other shades in the range. The color applied evenly and never tugged when applied directly from the tube. It stayed on well for five and a half hours and was a touch hydrating overall. I noticed that this shade didn‚Äôt seem to wear down to a matte finish until the fourth hour, and it has seemed that the faster it wears down to matte, the less comfortable it feels, so the extra slip in the formula helped this one.",A
COLOUR POP,WHAT IF,Lipstick,"a deep, raspberry pink with cool, blue undertones and a cream finish. It had good color coverage, though it wasn‚Äôt opaque, in a single layer. The lipstick had a creamy consistency that felt lightweight and was comfortable to apply, but it was prone to settling in my lip lines (which worsened over time) and did not apply as evenly along the edges as it should have. This shade wore well for six hours, left a stain behind, and was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",B
PAT MCGRATH,DIVINE BROWN,Lipstick,"a deep, reddish-brown with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had intense color payoff that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips‚Äìnever tugging‚Äìin a single stroke. The consistency was velvety, lightly creamy, and smooth, so it adhered well to my lips and did not slide around, but it still felt comfortable as it wore. It lost a lot of its initial shine within two hours of wear, and then it was matte from thereon. The color stayed on well for seven hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
GIVENCHY,BRUN BAROQUE,Lipstick,"a dark brown with subtle, warm red undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that did not apply as evenly as expected, and the product seemed to clump in places where my lips weren‚Äôt perfectly smooth (despite exfoliating prior to applying the lipstick). The consistency felt smooth, velvety, and thin without being clingy, so it was comfortable to apply and to wear. It lasted for four and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing, but it did pull into my lip lines over time.",C+
GIVENCHY,NEO NUDE,Lipstick,"a medium plum with subtle, cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips without catching on imperfections. This was one of the better shades in the formula. The texture was lightly creamy, velvety, and smooth without being heavy or overly wet. The color pulled into my deeper lip lines just slightly, but it didn‚Äôt worsen over the five hours it lasted for. The formula felt lightly hydrating over time.",A-
SMASHBOX,IT'S FIRE,Palette,"a light yellow, rich orange-gold, and deep copper. Two shades were fairly good while one was a definite miss, but it would be essential to use this formula over a primer and to use the shimmers with a dampened brush to maximize coverage, blendability, and application.",B
KAT VON D,VAMPIRA,Lipstick,"a deep burgundy with cool, red undertones and a semi-matte finish. It appeared on a lot lighter than it did in the tube, which may have been in due in part to it being only semi-opaque in pigmentation (‚Äúunbelievably pigmented‚Äù ‚Äî not even close). The stiff, denser consistency had a tendency to collect on itself, which resulted in patchy application and crumbles of color that slid into my lip lines over time. The lipstick lasted well for seven hours but was somewhat drying over time, and the color further settled into my lip lines over time.",C
KAT VON D,HOMEGIRL,Lipstick,"a deep burgundy with cool, berry undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which did not apply evenly (though it wasn‚Äôt the most patchy version of this shade I‚Äôve come across). The texture was stiffer and dense, which made it tug on the lips and was best applied with short strokes or with a lip brush. It was thin, a little clingy, and definitely drying over the seven hours it lasted for. The color wore unevenly from the center of my mouth and had some color gather in my lip lines over time, too.",C-
KAT VON D,GOLD BLOODED,Lipstick,"a medium red with neutral-to-warm undertones and flecks of gold glitter. By glitter, I mean grit that scraped my lips and made it one of the most painful lipsticks I have ever applied in over a decade. This might be one of the least comfortable, most drying, and all-around terribly disappointing products that leave me puzzled why any brand would release it and put their name on it. The texture was stiff, dry, and yielded semi-sheer coverage, which did not build up as there was no give at all. It lasted for four hours and left my lips feeling absolutely raw.",F
COLOUR POP,GHOSTED,Lipstick,"a medium plum with warm undertones and a cream finish. It was richly pigmented and had a smooth, creamy consistency that was lightweight and thin without feeling clingy. The color applied evenly and did not tug during application. This shade wore well for four and a half hours, and it felt just a touch hydrating overall. It did not seem to mattify as much (or as quickly) compared to the other two shades in this review over time, which made it more comfortable to wear.",A
COLOUR POP,ON REPEAT,Lipstick,"a rich, deep coral-red with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly, but the thinner, more matte texture seemed to emphasize my lip lines a bit more than other shades (which had a smoother end result). The lipstick itself was still creamy enough not to tug on my lips, and it was easy to control along the edges of my lips. It wore well for almost six hours and left behind a slight stain, but I found this one to be a a smidgen drying after four hours, where it seemed to feel a bit thinner and looked more matte.",A-
COLOUR POP,GET A ROOM,Lipstick,"a medium orange with warm, red undertones and a satin finish. It had good color coverage, though it wasn‚Äôt opaque, and this was particularly unforgiving on my lips. There was something about the way it applied that made it prone to pulling away at my lip lines and emphasizing every line and imperfection on my lips. The texture itself was creamy and smooth‚Äìcomfortable and easy to apply‚Äìbut looked significantly less flattering on compared to most shades in the range. It wore well for five and a half hours, left a subtle stain behind, and it was non-drying overall, though it felt drier (again, not drying!) and looked very matte after three hours of wear.",C+
COLOUR POP,DROP OF A HAT,Blush,"a medium coral with warm, pink undertones and a golden sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation when applied with fingertips and semi-sheer to semi-opaque, buildable coverage when applied with a brush. The texture felt smooth, lightly emollient, and applied evenly to bare skin as well as over foundation (as it did not disturb my base). The blush dried down to a powder-like finish and lasted for nine hours on me. I noticed that the finish on this seemed a bit dewier, possibly due to the shimmer amount or size, and that it appeared pinker as I sheered it out on my cheeks (not quite as orange/coral).",A
WET 'N' WILD,NOT A BASIC PEACH,Palette,"a rollercoaster of a palette with highs and lows. I normally spend around 10 minutes per eye (from planning to finished look) when working with a moderate amount of colors and contrasting hues, but I spent a half hour just fussing with the shades to get something half-decent out of it. There was a ton of product underneath my eye after all was said and done. There were a couple of nicer shades in the palette, but it‚Äôs not a palette I‚Äôd use again and while cheap, not something I‚Äôd recommend.",D+
PAT MCGRATH,PEEP SHOW,Lipstick,"a soft, peachy-coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. The color payoff was nearly opaque in a single stroke, and it was buildable to full coverage with a second layer (as needed). The texture was lightweight, creamy and velvety without being heavy or overly slippery on the lips, but the product pulled away at my lip lines and appeared a little ‚Äúcracked‚Äù when I smiled. After five minutes, the product seemed to sit a bit better on my lips, but for the price, one probably wants perfection. It wore well for five hours and was non-drying in feel.",B+
PAT MCGRATH,MODERN WOMAN,Lipstick,"a muted, medium mauve with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was opaque as described, while the consistencyw as smooth, velvety, and creamy enough to glide on with ease. The color went on evenly and adhered nicely to the lips, but there was a smidgen of color that gathered in my deeper lip lines but wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance. It stayed on well for almost six hours and was just a touch hydrating.",A
PAT MCGRATH,CANDY FLIP,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark pink-coral with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. The lipstick felt smooth and velvety as it glided across my lips without tugging or pulling on them. It delivered rich color coverage in a single pass that was easy to maneuver along the edges. There was very slight color that sat in my deeper lip lines, though it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance to my eyes. It wore well for seven hours and was neither drying nor hydrating over time.",A
COLOUR POP,SPECIAL DELIVERY,Eyeshadow,"a medium, minty green with subtle, warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied somewhat evenly to the lid, but it seemed like it would function better as a layering shade for added shimmer and sparkle. The texture felt wet to the touch but wasn‚Äôt too slippery, and it set to a power-like finish that wore well all day long and had almost no fallout after 10 hours of wear.",B+
COLOUR POP,SNAPDRAGON,Eyeshadow,"a medium teal with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had good pigmentation with a velvety, dense consistency that was thin on the lid but still adhered evenly and blended out fairly easily along the edges. On me, it wore well for 10 hours without fading or creasing.",A
COLOUR POP,ZOOMSHIP,Eyeshadow,"a vibrant, medium blue with cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It was richly pigmented and had a smooth, velvety texture that was sponge-like but had the blendability of a cream while retaining the pigmentation and ease of use of a powder eyeshadow. This shade lasted for 10 hours on me without fading or creasing.",A+
COLOUR POP,FROG,Eyeshadow,"a muted, peachy pink with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish that was multi-colored. The texture felt wet to the touch, very creamy without being thick or heavy, so it was easy to pat onto the lid for a sheer wash of shimmer or layered on top of another eyeshadow for a sparkling effect. It had medium coverage, which was buildable to semi-opaque coverage but was not opaque on its own. The eyeshadow stayed on well for nine hours with slight fallout over time.",B+
COLOUR POP,WITTLE,Eyeshadow,"a medium plum with warm undertones and a sparkling finish. It had more of a pearlized finish with flecks of sparkle on top. The color payoff was opaque in a single layer, and the color applied evenly and smoothly over bare lids. The consistency was smooth, lightly emollient, and easy to work with along the edges. It wore well for 10 hours without fading or creasing.",A+
COLOUR POP,NO PROMISES,Eyeshadow,"a dark copper with warm, orange undertones and a matte finish. It had opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which applied evenly to the lid and blended out easily along the edges for a smooth gradient that sat flatteringly on the skin. On me, it stayed on well for 10 hours without fading or creasing.",A
BITE BEAUTY,AQUARIUS,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark purple with strong, warm pink undertones and a satin finish. It was, in fact, quite aptly described by Bite as a ‚Äúberry plum,‚Äù as I found myself looking through berry, plum, and purple for dupes and not finding as many as I wanted to find that were that similar.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,I648 GOLDEN FAWN,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark gold with warm, brown undertones and a pearly sheen. It had opaque pigmentation with a smooth, moderately dense consistency that was blendable on the lid but was best applied with a flat, synthetic brush for maximum coverage. The color stayed on well for almost 10 hours on me before fading noticeably.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,ME728 COPPER RED,Eyeshadow,"a rich, medium-dark copper with warm, red-orange undertones and a metallic sheen. It was richly pigmented and had a smooth, moderately dense texture that was cream-like without being thick, so it sat more flatteringly on my lid and did not emphasize the texture. The color blended out nicely on the lid without losing its intensity. It wore well for 10 hours on me before creasing faintly.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,I662 AMBER BROWN,Eyeshadow,"a medium, golden bronze with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, while the texture was smooth to the touch, dense without being stiff, but it was thinner and required a heavier hand to pickup with a brush. I had no trouble diffusing the edges with my fluffier brushes, though. It lasted for 10 hours on me before I saw signs of wear.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,ME654 CAULDRON,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, golden bronze brown with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It was less metallic than I expected given the finish type. The texture was smooth to the touch, but it could have been more yielding instead of as dense as it was, which would have made it easier to pickup product with a brush and apply it to the lid. It had good pigmentation that applied best in short, patting and pressing motions and then diffusing the edges as needed. The color stayed on well for 10 hours on me before fading slightly.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M705 CANYON,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium orange-brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. The texture was smooth and velvety without being powdery, but it was still easy to apply, blend out, and diffuse along the edges. It had opaque coverage in a single layer that wore well for nine and a half hours on me.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,ME624 BLACK GOLD,Eyeshadow,"a deep, black-brown with warm, olive undertones and a pearly sheen. It had rich color payoff that applied evenly onto bare skin and blended out without issue along the edges. The eyeshadow felt smooth to the touch without being overly dense or too thick on the skin. It wore well for 10 hours on me before creasing faintly.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M650 COOKIE,Eyeshadow,"a soft, light, golden brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. The color payoff was fantastic, while the texture was smooth, velvety, and dense enough not to be powdery but still silky enough to diffuse and blend out nicely on the lid. It wore well for almost nine and a half hours on me before fading noticeably.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,I520 PINKY SAND,Eyeshadow,"a light peach with warm, golden shimmer. It looked significantly lighter swatched and applied to the lid than it did in the pan. The texture was smooth, moderately dense, and a little stiffer than was ideal, as it required a heavier handed approach to pickup product onto my brush. I had no trouble blending out the powder on my lid. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that stayed on well for nine hours on me.",B-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,D308 AQUATIC KHAKI,Eyeshadow,"a blackened, olive green base with bluish-teal flecks of sparkle over a pearly finish. It had good color coverage, though it could have been more pigmented in a single layer. The texture was moderately dewnse and a little thicker than most of the other Diamond/Metallic shade sin the formula, but it was still fairly blendable on my skin but had a marginally drier feel overall. The color wore well for nine and a half hours but had some fallout.",B
KAT VON D,WHITE OUT,Lipstick,"a bright white with a matte finish. It was one of the most matte shades in the range, and while the color can be worn alone, it was also included in the range to be mixed with other shades. It was a terrible mixing shade, as it was just so dry that it did not blend and merge with other colors well. It had a tendency to cake up on the lips when I used it as a base, and it just stuck to my finger if I tried patting it on top of something else. When I tried to use a lip brush, it was a bit better, but it was still difficult to get the shade to go on evenly and blend with whatever I wanted to layer it with. On its own, it lasted for four hours but settled into my lip lines quite a bit and was drying. Frankly, it was easier to wear it alone than it was to mix with anything else as the texture was just so stiff.",F
KAT VON D,NAYEON,Lipstick,"a medium black with cool undertones and flecks of sparkle and shimmer in it. It had semi-opaque pigmentation at most, and the texture was a bit thinner and had a bit more slip than others in the line, I could feel every particle as the lipstick scraped across my lips. The color did not go on evenly and pulled into my lip lines, which did worsen and become more and more apparent as it wore on. It stayed on me for about four hours and was lightly drying over time.",D-
KAT VON D,SLAYER,Lipstick,"a medium-dark black with neutral-to-warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in a single layer and was somewhat buildable to greater coverage, but I would recommend a liner and a lip brush. The texture was drier, firmer, and dense, which made it difficult to apply to the lips as it tugged a lot and did not lay down color evenly. I had issues with getting product to adhere well to the center of my lips (where it can be wetter), which only made the end result worse. It lasted for five hours but was moderately drying within two hours of wearing it and product gathered in my lip lines over time.",D-
COLOUR POP,MONKEY BUSINESS,Blush,"a bright, medium orange-red with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly over the skin and blended out fairly well along the edges, but I found that my fingertips were best when blending out the edges when using it as a blush. The consistency was a bit dense, smooth to the touch, and more velvety than cream-like (which is often true for the brand‚Äôs matte finishes in this formula). It wore well for 10 hours on me without fading or creasing.",A-
COLOUR POP,CUTEOLOGIST,Blush,"a rich orange with warm, red undertones and flecks of gold sparkle over a matte finish. It had opaque pigmentation with a smooth, plush consistency that was firmer and ‚Äústiffer‚Äù compared to many other Super Shocks, but it applied well with a brush to bare skin with even application and easy blending. It wore well for 10 hours and hadn‚Äôt faded or creased on me.",A
COLOUR POP,DON'T LEAVE,Blush,"a deep fuchsia pink with cool undertones and a pearl finish. It was intensely pigmented with a smooth, lightly emollient consistency that felt wet to the touch but applied and blended out like a powder product on the skin. I had no trouble applying it with fingertips or brushes on cheeks or on my eyes. It lasted for 10 hours",A+
COLOUR POP,ISSA,Blush,"a deep purple with subtle, warm pink undertones and blue and purple pearl. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a smooth, creamy consistency that was lightly emollient but spongy and dense like other Super Shocks. As a blush, it did not sheer out as evenly as I would have liked, but with some patience, it could work. It functioned better as an eyeshadow, where it went on with good coverage, adhered evenly, and was blendable along the edges. It wore well for 10 hours on me without fading or creasing.",A-
COLOUR POP,DADDY,Blush,"a medium-dark lavender with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation with a drier, firmer consistency that didn‚Äôt actually feel dried out, but it was a little hard to diffuse around the edges with a brush. It seemed to apply and blend out better with a fingertip (probably due to the warmth). It worked decently as a blush color and lasted for nine hours.",B
SMASHBOX,#REPOST,Palette,three shimmery shades with two being more distinctive duochrome shades and one having a subtle shift but more of an iridescent finish overall. The quality of the shades made this one a miss‚Äìonly one decent shade in the trio!,C
MAKE UP FOR EVER,D712 CR√®ME BR√ªL√©E,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark copper with arm undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. It had good pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage with two layers. The texture was dense without being too stiff, but it did require a slightly heavier hand to pickup product well. It applied evenly to bare skin and lasted for 10 hours on me. The new version is slightly rosier (see comparison swatches).",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,I808 ENGLISH PINK,Eyeshadow,"a medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a satin sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied decently to bare skin but had a tendency to skip a bit when I tried to diffuse it, so it did not sheer out well and was best used as a more opaque shade and built up. The texture was a bit drier and stiffer to the touch. It wore well for nine hours on me.",C+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,S814 LIGHT ROSEWOOD,Eyeshadow,"a medium, peachy coral with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-opaque color payoff in one layer, which was somewhat buildable, but the texture was thinner and on the drier side, so I found it harder to pickup product on my brush and really build it up on the lid without a primer. It blended out decently but could have been better. On me, this shade lasted for nine hours on me. The prior formula was lighter and brighter with less shimmer (see comparison swatches).",C+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,ME840 PINK CHROME,Eyeshadow,"a brighter, medium plum with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer with a smooth, denser consistency that wasn‚Äôt too stiff, so I could still pickup product well on fluffier brushes and blend it out on my lid while getting even, opaque coverage. It stayed on well for nine and a half hours on me. The new version is unlike the old version (see comparison swatches).",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,ME828 GARNET BLACK,Eyeshadow,"a deep, plummy brown with subtle, warm undertones and a pearly sheen. The color coverage was opaque and a little went a long way. The consistency was dense without being stiff, smooth, and blendable on the lid, which made it an easy eyeshadow to apply and use on my lids. On me, it wore well for 10 and a half hours. It was quite similar to the previous formula (see comparison swatches).",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M928 EGGPLANT,Eyeshadow,"a dark plum with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable color coverage with a soft, lightly powdery consistency that felt and blended out better in practice than it appeared in the initial swatch. It wore well for nine and a half hours on me on my eyes and nine hours as a cheek color.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M820 DARK PURPLE PINK,Eyeshadow,"a deep pink with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque in a single layer, while the consistency was smooth, velvety, and didn‚Äôt have any powderiness despite still being very blendable on the eye. It lasted nicely for nine hours before fading a bit, but it did stain my lids; as a cheek color, it wore well for nine hours but did not seem to stain. It was very similar to the previous formula (see comparison swatches).",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M530 EGGSHELL,Eyeshadow,"a light beige with neutral-to-warm undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was velvety and silky to the touch with almost no excess powder kicked up in the pan, even when used with fluffy brushes. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that blended out nicely and stayed on well for nine hours on me. It seemed slightly warmer than the previous formula (see comparison swatches).",B
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M853 NEON PINK,Eyeshadow,"a bright, neon pink with cool, blue undertones and a matte finish. It had intense, opaque pigmentation that was a lot easier to use than I expected, and it had a much smoother, more finely-milled texture than a lot of rich pinks do (they can often be a little dry and grainy). It wore well for 11 hours on me but stained my lid slightly after removal, and it managed to stay on my cheeks for 10 and a half hours.",A
COLOUR POP,CHEETAH,Lipstick,"a medium-dark lavender with soft, wamr undertones and a cream finish. It had excellent pigmentation with a lightly creamy, smooth consistency that skated across the lips with ease and applied well along the edges. There was a bit of product that settled into my lip lines, and this worsened slightly over time (not terrible but noticeable to my eye). It was really comfortable to wear for two and a half hours, and then it started to wear down to a more matte finish and the thinner texture was more apparent, though just shy of being clingy and the formula itself felt non-drying over the four hours this shade lasted for.",B+
COLOUR POP,SITTING PRETTY,Lipstick,"a medium-dark berry with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage in a single layer, which applied evenly and smoothly across my lips. The lipstick was lightly creamy where it glided nicely along my lips but didn‚Äôt feel overly slippery while worn. The texture did seem more prone to wearing to a very matte finish faster than other shades with a similar creaminess (at least, in my experience), so it didn‚Äôt feel as comfortable after a few hours of wear as it did initially. It wore well for six hours, left a slight stain behind, and was non-drying.",A
COLOUR POP,27,Lipstick,"a deep, reddish-plum with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had rich color payoff that applied evenly and smoothly in a single stroke and glided across my lips without tugging. The consistency was lightly creamy, smooth, though it definitely wore down to a more matte finish within a couple of hours (seemed faster than average with this type of finish) and felt a touch clingy. The color stayed on well for five hours on me and was non-drying.",A
COLOUR POP,ON MY MIND,Lipstick,"a soft, medium pinky-peach with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-sheer coverage that was buildable to medium coverage when applied with a brush and medium to semi-opaque, buildable coverage when applied with fingertips. The texture felt smooth to the touch, yielded when pressed, but it was thin and easy to work with as it dried to a powder-like finish quickly (but remained blendable around the edges after it dried down). This particular shade looked more like a highlighter on my skin tone but could work as a blush on fairer complexions. It wore well for nine hours on me.",A-
PAT MCGRATH,DECADENCE,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette for spring that features 10 eyeshadows‚Äìnine are metallic and one is more of a satin-to-pearl. It is one of the best palettes I‚Äôve had the pleasure of wearing, and it‚Äôs definitely the best/most consistent palette from Pat McGrath so far. Every single shade was pigmented, blendable, easy to work with, and long-wearing. They had an intensely shiny finish that looked like molten metal on the lid‚Äìand they didn‚Äôt need primer nor did they need to be applied using a dampened brush to achieve that effect.",A
NATASHA DENONA,CITRUS,Palette,"six shades‚Äìtwo cream formulas, four powder formulas‚Äìin an assortment of finishes, textures, and shades. The palette is designed to be layered, though they can all be worn alone. I really enjoyed the palette, but I don‚Äôt expect it to be the most functional or practical purchase. The top row has a clear, plastic lid that is supposed to keep them from getting powder in them; and the third shade (on the right), while powder, is very dense, so there wasn‚Äôt any excess product kicked up when I used it.",A-
STILA,BOHEME,Eyeshadow,"a medium, rosy copper with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, thin consistency that was easy to apply to the lid for an even, opaque layer of product, but it could also be blended out for a medium-coverage wash of color. The liquid eyeshadow blended out easily and dried down fast enough not to settle into creases but slow enough that I had time to work with it, too. It wore well for 10 hours on me and did not crease or fade.",A+
STILA,CAREFREE,Eyeshadow,"a medium pink with warm undertones and a fine, pearly sheen. This was one of the least shimmery/metallic shades I‚Äôve tried in the line-up, which some may enjoy and others may miss. The consistency was fluid, watery without being too wet or thin, and applied with mostly opaque coverage with a brush or directly from the tube, though the latter tended to over-apply product in my experience. It blended out nicely and lasted for 10 hours on me.",A-
STILA,FREEDOM,Eyeshadow,"a light, bluish aqua with cool undertone and flecks of silver and white sparkle. It had semi-sheer color payoff, and it was not buildable. The texture was thin and more watery, but it applied unevenly and had a tendency to look chunky as the sparkles clumped up in places. I could see this working better as an inner tearduct highlighter or layered over a deeper (like a navy or teal) eyeshadow or eyeliner, but it was hard to use as a standalone eyeshadow. The product itself had good wear and lasted for 10 hours without fallout or creasing on me.",D-
PAT MCGRATH,FEMMEBOT,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark pink with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque, while the color applied evenly onto my lips and never tugged during application. The texture was lightweight, velvety, and not too thick or too thin, so it was comfortable on my lips, though I noticed that there was a touch of color in my deeper lip lines upon initial application with this shade. It wore well for five and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
PAT MCGRATH,POLAROID PINK,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque color payoff in a single stroke, which went on evenly and smoothly on my lips and never tugged or dragged during application. There was a bit of color that pulled into my lip lines, though. The consistency was lightweight, velvety, and smooth, which made it comfortable to wear over the six hours it lasted for. The formula was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",A-
PAT MCGRATH,FAUX PAS,Lipstick,"a medium-dark lavender with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. It was intensely pigmented with opaque coverage delivered in a single layer. The color applied evenly and smoothly across the lips with a dense, creamy, and velvety consistency that never tugged on the lips. The lipstick started to look more matte after three hours of wear, and it lasted for a solid five and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating over time.",A
COLOUR POP,FRIENDS,Lipstick,"a deep, chocolaty brown with subtle, warm red undertones and a cream finish. It had rich color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips without tugging. The consistency was creamy and yielded a more noticeable shine than other shades in the line-up, though it somehow managed not to feel overly slippery, and eventually wore down to a mostly matte finish after two and a half hours of wear. It had a more forgiving texture, too, and seemed to fill in my lip lines and smooth them out. This shade wore well for five and a half hours and felt non-drying to me.",A
COLOUR POP,GETTY,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark blue-leaning teal with cool undertones and a cream finish. This was one of the creamier, more emollient shades in the original 24-hue range, and I was worried about the application, but it applied beautifully: even, opaque color coverage that didn‚Äôt look streaky or patchy in any way. The lipstick felt lightweight and was comfortable to wear. It wore well for six hours, left a purplish stain behind, and was lightly moisturizing over time.",A
COLOUR POP,AERONAUT,Lipstick,"a deep, inky black with a glossy sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly across the lips. The application could have been more even overall, though it the lipstick itself glided across my lips without tugging. I would say that the texture was a bit too emollient, which may have been why it did not apply as well as other shades. It stayed on well for five hours and was lightly hydrating while worn.",B+
STILA,PERLINA,Eyeshadow,"a bright, translucent white base with multi-colored sparkle and shimmer dominated by bright white and silver. This was really lovely for brightening and layering over other products, particularly along the inner tearduct and lower lash line. It had semi-sheer coverage, which was buildable to medium coverage before it started to get too thick and too chunky to wear well. One layer of product stayed on well for almost 10 hours with very minimal fallout.",B+
STILA,ENCHANTRESS,Eyeshadow,"a medium, pinky-coral with subtle, warm undertones and fleckes of gold and pink pearl and sparkle. It had semi-sheer to medium coverage, which was buildable to opaque coverage. The consistency was thin, watery, but controllable and easy to work with as a standalone eyeshadow (and still worked well for layering). It wore well for 10 hours with little to no fallout (I want to say none, but I feel like there must have been a sparkle or two!)",B+
STILA,FAIRY TAIL,Eyeshadow,"a deep, smoldering bronze with warm undertones and flecks of gold and lavender sparkle. It had medium coverage in a single layer, which was builable to semi-opaque coverage with two layers and applied with a flat, synthetic brush, but it had a seemingly clear base, so the ‚Äúcoverage‚Äù was in the form of shimmer/sparkle. It lasted well for 10 hours with just a few flecks of fallout.",A-
COLOUR POP,BOY,Eyeshadow,"a medium peach with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had good color coverage in one pass, and despite being one of the lighter shades in the range, applied rather evenly. This shade settled more obviously into my lip lines, though. For this type of color and finish, it was impressive, but there is still room for improvement. It had a lightweight, lightly creamy consistency that glided across the lips without tugging and felt comfortable over time. It stayed on well for four hours and was non-drying.",B+
COLOUR POP,STONE FOX,Eyeshadow,"a bright, pop of medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly on the lips and had the most minimal settling, which was surprising as the texture was wetter and more slippery compared to most shades in the range. I felt like it ‚Äúset‚Äù a bit after a few minutes, so the texture felt less slippery on my lips and did not slide around while I wore it. The color lasted for four and a half hours and was slightly hydrating while worn.",A-
COLOUR POP,UNO MAS,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, muted coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. The lipstick glided across my lips without tugging or pulling as the consistency was smooth, lightly creamy, and easy to work with along the edges of the lips for a clean application. It had opaque color coverage in a single layer, which went on evenly and stayed in place well over time. There was a bit of product that pulled into my deeper lip lines that wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance. It wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.",A
COLOUR POP,TEASECAKE,Highlighter,"a soft, light-medium peach with warm, pink-to-gold shifting pearl. It had a subtle sheen to its finish, and I could see this working well on a myriad of skin tones as a subtle highlighter and on very fair skin as a subtle, everyday blush with a little oomph. The consistency was smooth to the touch with a little give, but it was dense and thin, which made it have a very smooth appearance on the skin. I found that it was a bit more prone to lifting my foundation if I wasn‚Äôt careful compared to other Super Shock Cheek shades (but really, just barely noticeable). It had medium, buildable pigmentation that wore well for nine and a half hours before fading noticeably.",A-
HOURGLASS,PINK FLASH,Highlighter,"a light pink with soft, warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-sheer, buildable color coverage (up to semi-opaque), and it was the sheerest shade in the range that I tried. The consistency was incredibly lightweight with some slip‚Äìenough to feel like a cream-based product, but it never felt too slippery or greasy on my skin. It dried down somewhat, but it never fully set and yet still managed to wear for a solid eight hours over bare skin. The highlighter blended out easily along the edges and did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture.",B
COLOUR POP,PARALLEL,Blush,"a bright, medium peony pink with subtle, warm undertones and a golden sheen. It was more pigmented than anticipated‚Äìsemi-opaque to opaque with fingertips, though it was easily sheered down for more medium coverage as I blended and spread the product across my skin‚Äìand truer to the medium, buildable coverage claim when applied with a stippling brush. The texture felt wetter than most of the Super Shock Cheeks, but it was incredibly easy to diffuse and blend out on my skin. It dried down and set, but it did not lose its luminous finish. On me, it wore well for 10 hours before fading slightly.",A
COLOUR POP,APPY,Lipstick,"a light-medium, peachy coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had good color coverage in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with two layers. The texture was smooth, on the thinner side but not so thin that it felt clingy. It glided across my lips without tugging and applied evenly, though there was a bit of product that pulled into my deeper lip lines, which wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance. It wore well for four and a half hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating over time.",A-
COLOUR POP,LAY OVER,Lipstick,"Colour Pop Lay Over Lux Lipstick ($7.00 for 0.12 oz.) is a soft, muted coral with warm undertones and a cream finish. This shade had a bit more shine than others in the line-up, but it was still opaque in coverage in one layer. The consistency was lightweight, creamy enough to skate across my lips without pulling, but on the thinner side so the product didn‚Äôt slide around over time. There was a bit of product that pulled into my lip lines, but it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance. This shade stayed on well for five hours and was lightly hydrating to me.",A
COLOUR POP,LA LADY,Lipstick,"a medium, reddened plum with warm undertones and a satin finish. It was intensely pigmented and yielded opaque pigmentation in a single stroke. The lipstick was lightly creamy‚Äìthin but not clingy‚Äìwith an ultra, lightweight feel that was comfortable to wear and didn‚Äôt show ‚Äúlines‚Äù when I pressed my lips together. I couldn‚Äôt see it in person, but in the close-up photos, there was a touch of product that pulled into my deeper lip lines. The formula felt lightly hydrating over the five and a half hours it lasted for.",A
BOBBI BROWN,MOON GLOW,Highlighter,"a medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation with a smooth, moderately dense powder consistency.",A-
BOBBI BROWN,OPAL GLOW,Highlighter,"a medium, dusty pink with warm, multi-colored sparkle and pearl. The consistency felt more sparkly compared to other shades in the formula, as there were larger sparkle/shimmer particles throughout. It had medium, buildable coverage, both in terms of color as well as the intensity of the shine/shimmer. The consistency was dense and smooth, so there wasn‚Äôt any excess powder kicked up in the pan, but it was a cinch to pick up product with my brush. The powder applied evenly to my skin, diffused nicely, and did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. On me, it wore well for eight and a half hours.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,ROSE PEARL,Highlighter,"a medium-dark, coppery brown with copper-to-pink shifting sparkle. This shade seemed to have the most sparkle, so it seemed more glittery compared to the other shades in the line-up. It had semi-sheer, buildable coverage, up to semi-opaque.",B-
MAC,MOON LANDING,Lipstick,"a deep, navy blue with cool, violet undertones and a metallic finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that did not apply evenly and was extremely prone to drying down into my lip lines and looking ‚Äúcracked‚Äù when I smiled. The consistency was lightweight, thin but not clingy, but I noticed this particular shade seemed a little more watery and took longer to dry down (which may have contributed to application problems across the board). This shade lasted for six hours, left a stain behind, and was on the drying side.",C-
MAC,BUZZED OUT,Lipstick,"a bright, medium fuchsia pink with subtle, cool undertones and a pearly sheen. It had good pigmentation but wasn‚Äôt quite opaque in a single layer. The product applied evenly for the most part, though there subtle streaks along the edges of my lips even after the product had dried down fully. The formula was fairly comfortable to wear, as the consistency wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin and did not feel clingy after it dried on my lips. It wore well for six and a half hours, left a faint stain behind, and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B
MAC,IN RETROGRADE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark red with cool undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good color coverage in a single layer, though it wasn‚Äôt full coverage without a second layer. The liquid lipstick had a thin consistency that spread easily but did not seem overly watery, so I had no trouble controlling the color as I spread it across my lips. It stayed on well for eight hours and was non-drying.",A
MILANI,LUMINOUS LIGHT,Highlighter,"a light pink with pink-to-lavender shifting, ultra-fine pearl paired with a satin finish. I found it looked cooler-toned and more lavender applied and blended out on my cheekbones than it appeared in the pan. It had good pigmentation, which was buildable to full coverage with half of layer more, but it was also easy to sheer out if preferred. The texture was soft, smooth, and blendable without being too firmly or too losely pressed in the pan. The powder applied easily and sat well on my skin. It wore for eight hours before I noticed signs of fading.",A
MAC,CORAL PLATED,Lipstick,"a medium, orange-copper with warm, yellow undertones and faint, golden pearl. It had opaque color payoff in a single layer, and the color was fluid enough to apply evenly across the lips without having to work at it. The texture was thicker than others in the line-up, but it wasn‚Äôt too thick and did not take long to dry down, though there was a bit of product that dried down into my deeper lip lines. It wore well for six hours and was non-drying.",B+
MAC,FOILED,Lipstick,"a medium-dark copper with warm, reddish-brown undertones and flecks of gold sparkle over a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was harder to build up, as the consistency was on the watery side and prone to apply unevenly. This shade lasted for six and a half hours on me but did not fade evenly away from the center of the mouth. The formula felt somewhat drying after five hours of wear.",C
MAC,METROCHROME,Lipstick,"a medium, golden copper with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque color payoff in a single layer, and while it could be built up, I found that the more metallic texture was less forgiving and very prone to emphasizing my lip texture quite a bit. The texture was a little more substantial than a thin formula, but it wasn‚Äôt heavy or thick, so I did not have trouble applying it along the edges of my lips. It wore well for five and a half hours and was somewhat drying.",C
BITE BEAUTY,OYSTER PEARL,Highlighter,"a plummy brown base with copper-to-green shifting sparkle and fine pearl. It had semi-sheer, buildable pigmentation (up to semi-opaque) with a lightly tinted base but was primarily ‚Äúpigmented‚Äù through its shimmer.",B-
NARS,FRIOUL,Eyeshadow,"a taupe-brown base with green-to-blue shifting shimmer. It had sheer coverage, which I was able to build to semi-opaque coverage, but it had a tendency to look a little uneven on my lid. I could see it looking more even on deeper skin tones and could work as a smoky, one-and-done shade. The consistency was slightly drier and thinner, so it did tug a bit on the lid initially. It lasted for six hours on me before creasing.",F
NARS,GALICE,Eyeshadow,"a light, bright pewter with warm, golden undertones and a metallic sheen. It had medium coverage that was buildable to mostly opaque coverage with two to three layers. The texture was lightweight, thin with a light tackiness that set within a minute. There was enough creaminess that it did not tug noticeably on my mobile lid during application. I saw faint creasing after six hours of wear.",C+
COVER FX,MAGIC,Eyeshadow,"a light, peachy pink with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. The consistency was a little more gel-like and fluid compared to other shades, though it was easy to work patted over the lips, cheeks, or as a one-and-done shade on the lid but took a little more coaxing when used with a brush on the eyelid. It produced a beautiful, luminous sheen on cheeks that stayed on well for nine hours. On eyes, it was brightening on its own and emphasized my lid texture slightly when I applied it at semi-opaque or greater levels, but the wear was solid at eight and a half hours. As a lip product, it was the most forgiving and least emphasizing of the six shades but still had quite a bit of shine, and it wore well for four and a half hours on my lips.",A-
COVER FX,MOONSTONE,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, coppery plum with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. It had medium, buildable coverage that could be sheered out if desired but seemed to look its best at medium or greater coverage (the shimmer didn‚Äôt seem as noticeable otherwise). The consistency was a little thicker overall, and of all the shades in the line-up, this one seemed to be a bit harder to sheer out evenly on the cheeks. On the flip side, it was the most lipstick-like shade on the lips as it also added some color. It wore well for five hours as a lip color and nine hours as both a cheek highlighter and eyeshadow.",B+
COVER FX,SOLEIL,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, rosy copper with a sparkling, metallic finish. It had medium to opaque, buildable pigmentation that applied easily to cheeks and lips and decently to eyelids. The concern I had on my eyelids was that it was prone to emphasizing my lid texture and wasn‚Äôt as easy to diffuse the edges due to a quick dry down time. It was easiest to pat onto the mobile lid as an accent or swept all over the lid for a sheer, luminous glow. It wore well for five hours as a lip color and nine hours as both a cheek highlighter and eyelid shade.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,BLUSH PEARL,Highlighter,"a translucent base with blue-to-silver shifting pearl and slightly larger, more sparkle-sized particles. The texture was fairly smooth despite how shimmery the finish was, and it definitely did not feel gritty or rough applied to the eyes, lips, or cheeks. The product was blendable along the edges. I did not find the coverage to be that buildable; it was primarily semi-sheer and could be sheered out slightly but I couldn‚Äôt build up the coverage beyond, at best, medium. It was transformative, though, and I could see the sheerness working well for this type of finish and shifting color.",C
BITE BEAUTY,PEACOCK PEARL,Highlighter,"a blackened brown base with green-to-teal shifting pearl. As a cheek or eye color, I could see it working better on deeper skin tones, as the underlying base color was a little uneven and patchy on the skin but a skin tone closer to that base would minimize how visible that was. On my skin tone, it was more apparent. This shade applied the most evenly and was most buildable on the eyelid compared to the others released, but I had no luck with wear time (consistent with my experience with the original Multistick formula).",D+
NARS,EMBRASSE MOI,Lipstick,"a light-medium, peachy orange with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a lightweight, smooth consistency that was fluid enough to disperse easily across the lips but did not feel watery or overly emollient, though it seemed to be slightly oilier compared to other shades. The color went on evenly, but there was a touch of product that sat in my deeper lip lines. It wore well for four hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.",B+
NARS,UNDER ARREST,Lipstick,"a muted, medium orange-brown with strong, orange undertones and a cream finish with a light shine. It was richly pigmented and delivered smooth, even color coverage in a single stroke. The texture was lightweight but substantial enough to glide easily across the lips without getting into my lip lines. The finish seemed to give the illusion of smoother lips after applied. On me, it stayed on well for five and a half hours and was somewhat moisturizing over time.",A
NARS,HELL GATE,Lipstick,"a deep, rich red with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish with a light shine. The consistency was smooth and fluid without being too thick or too watery, which meant I could spread the color out nicely but still had full coverage color payoff in a single layer. The shine wore away after a few hours but the color remained firmly in place. It lasted well for six hours and broke down more noticeably after a meal. The formula was lightly hydrating over time.",A+
NARS,SUMMER FIRE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with warm undertones and a sprinkling of fine shimmer. It had good color coverage in a single layer, though it wasn‚Äôt opaque. The liquid lipstick was fluid and easy to apply across the lips, and the consistency was dense enough that it did not well into my lip lines. This shade wore well for five hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.",A
FENTY BEAUTY,SAW-C,Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange with warm, yellow undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage in a single layer, while the consistency was lightweight, a bit thin, and had enough slip that it did not appear as smooth or as cream-like in finish as other shades in the range. I felt like it emphasized the texture of my lips and some color settled into my lip lines. It lasted for four hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating over time.",B
FENTY BEAUTY,S1NGLE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was as rich and as opaque as the brand described, while the consistency was creamy, smooth, and not too wet nor too heavy/thick on the lips. It applied evenly but some color pulled into my deeper lip lines, though it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance. This shade wore well for four and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
COVER FX,HALO,Eyeshadow,"a cool, blue-tinted white base with silver to blue shifting sparkle and pearl. The finish was nearly metallic on the skin and lips, though it dried down to a transfer-resistant finish (so it wasn‚Äôt truly glossy). Of the shades released, this one did not spread out as evenly as others, so it took a bit of extra effort to get even results, but it also seemed to be more medium to semi-opaque in coverage to begin with. It lasted well for five hours as a lip color, nine hours on my cheeks, and nine hours on my eyes.",B+
COVER FX,AMETHYST,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark pink with subtle, warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen that shifted between pink and cooler violet. It had medium, buildable coverage that could be sheered out or built up to more opaque coverage and greater sparkle/shine in finish. The consistency was lightweight, thin without being too watery, and comfortable to apply to lips, eyes, and cheeks (no burning on the lids!). This shade wore well for five hours as a standalone lip color, nine hours on my cheeks, and nine hours on my eyes.",A-
COVER FX,CELESTIAL,Eyeshadow,"a light pink with strong, warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It was almost blinding in how shiny and reflective it was, particularly on my lips (and it looked drier than it felt‚Äìit actually did not feel dry to me on). The coverage was semi-sheer to opaque, depending on application tool and whether it was layered. The consistency was smooth, thin without being too watery or too dense, and it spread nicely along my cheekbones and blended out fairly well on my eyelid with a brush (and well with a fingertip). It applied evenly on my lips but definitely emphasized my lip texture when my mouth was relaxed and then looked like a blinding ray of light when I smiled. It stayed on well for four and a half hours as a lip color, eight and a half hours on my cheeks, and nine hours on my eyes.",A-
MAC,QUARTZETTE,Lipstick,"a medium brown with warm, rosy undertones and a golden pearl. It had good color coverage‚Äìjust shy of truly opaque coverage‚Äìin one layer. The texture was smooth, lightweight without being too watery or too runny, but it went on thinly and evenly so it did not flake off as it wore away. This shade lasted well for seven hours on me and was slightly drying over time.",A-
MAC,PEARL PUNK,Lipstick,"a medium pink with strong, warm undertones and a pearly sheen over a matte finish. It had finer pearl compared to most of the other shades in the range, so it did not reflect light as strongly but seemed to be more forgiving of my lip texture. The consistency was smooth, lightweight, and spreadable without being too thick or too thin, so it dried down fast enough not to settle into my lip lines but not so fast that I couldn‚Äôt get it applied easily. The color lasted for six and a half hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
MAC,SOFTLY ROCKIN',Lipstick,"a medium peach coral with warm undertones and a barely-there shimmer over a matte finish. It had slightly larger sparkle and then finer pearl but did not seem to have as much shimmer overall compared to most of the other shades in the line-up. The texture was lightweight, smooth, and a little mousse-like as it wasn‚Äôt runny but still spreadable and didn‚Äôt apply thickly either. Unfortunately, it had semi-opaque coverage and did not go on as evenly as other shades in the range. It stayed on well for five and a half hours on me and was non-drying.",B-
URBAN DECAY,KALEIDOSCOPE DREAM,Palette,"11 shades of eyeshadow and a dual-ended blush housed in a cardboard palette with interior mirror. The layout of the palette seems to be a love/hate aspect of the palette, and whether or not the arrangement makes sense to your eyes, there is a lot of wasted space so the palette has that bulky feel that far too many Urban Decay palettes have had in the past. The formula used in this felt different to me than the brand‚Äôs typical formula (found in their singles)‚Äìthe shimmers were much, much denser and creamier to the point where some (like Dye) were a little too thick and were harder to blend seamlessly into the thinner matte textures. The majority of the shades were quite pigmented, and they adhered well to bare skin and lasted around eight hours. Some readers commented that the palette has a general feel of rehashing by the brand, and I‚Äôd agree that if you have a half dozen of Urban Decay‚Äôs palettes, you‚Äôll find quite a bit of overlap.",A-
DIOR,HOLO PINK (001),Highlighter,"a light pink with warm, peachy undertones and a metallic sheen. It had a subtle shift from peach to cooler pink, but it seemed more multi-colored in pearl than holographic or duochromatic, particularly compared to Holo Gold. The pigmenation was opaque, while the consistency was smooth, soft, and blendable without being too dry or too dense in the pan, which made it easy to pickup with a brush with precision and control. It delivered a strong, noticeable sheen on the skin, though it did not accentuate my skin‚Äôs natural texture. On me, the highlighter stayed on well for eight and a half hours.",A
MAKEUP REVOLUTION,LIQUID BRONZE GOLD,Highlighter,"a light, golden copper with warm undertones and a metallic finish. It had a strong sheen on the skin, which did emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture slightly at medium or greater coverage. The highlighter had a lightweight, almost water-like texture that spread well over bare skin and diffused easily along the edges for a seamless blend. It had buildable pigmentation from sheer to semi-opaque, and the intensity grew from moderate to metallic. The highlighter lasted well on my cheekbones for eight and a half hours.",B+
URBAN DECAY,BUN BUN,Lipstick,"a medium,, plummy brown with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had opaque color payoff in a single layer, and the texture was lightly creamy, smooth, and thick enough to help fill in lip lines rather than accentuate them, but it did not feel heavy applied. This shade stayed on well for five hours and was lightly hydrating.",A
URBAN DECAY,CLOUD9,Lipstick,"a brighter, medium purple with warm undertones and a satin finish. The color payoff was opaque in a single stroke, but the texture seemed a bit thinner and less smoothing compared to other shades with the same Comfort Matte finish (that I‚Äôve tried in the past). The lipstick applied evenly and did not tug during application. It wore well for five and a half hours, left a strong stain behind, and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
URBAN DECAY,BEAUTY BEAM,Palette,"three, luminous highlighters that range from copper to soft yellow to peach. All three shades were undeniably warm-toned, so I don‚Äôt expect it will appeal to everyone as a result. I only had slight issues with less pigmentation and a ever-so-slightly less-creamy texture with the third shade in the palette, but all three performed well.",A
MAKEUP REVOLUTION,LIQUID CHAMPAGNE,Highlighter,"a light-medium gold with warm undertones and a metallic finish. It had a soft, yellow base that made it appear lighter than Liquid Luminous Gold on the skin. The finish had noticeably shiny and shimmery but was more buildable in its intensity overall. The coverage was only buildable from sheer to medium coverage on me. It had a lightweight consistency that spread easily across my skin (whether bare or with foundation) and diffused without issue along the edges. The texture felt lightly emollient and more watery as it was rather thin overall. The highlighter stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me before fading noticeably.",B+
FENTY BEAUTY,CANDY VENOM,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a cream finish. It had good pigmentation‚Äìjust shy of truly opaque coverage‚Äìthat applied evenly across the lips, but the more emollient quality of the lipstick made it more prone to getting into my lip lines. I didn‚Äôt notice the settling much from a normal viewing distance, due to the color being rather bright and rich. This was one of the more slippery shades in the range, though it certainly felt comfortable to apply and to wear. On me, it wore well for over six hours, left a stain behind, and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
FENTY BEAUTY,MA'DAMN,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark red with cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It was opaque in a single stroke with a smooth, velvety texture that was creamy without being slippery or heavy in feel. The lipstick glided across my lips easily and delivered even coverage that stayed on well for over six hours. It left a reddish stain behind, and it had only started to feel a bit drying after eight hours of wear.",A
L'OREAL,GOLDEN HOUR,Highlighter,"a medium-dark gold with warm, orange undertones and fine, golden pearl. It yielded subtle, yellowish warmth and a fine, luminous sheen. It had sheer coverage, which did not build up beyond semi-sheer. The consistency was thin, seemingly oily from what I could feel, which helped it spread easily across the skin but made it take longer to dry down. The highlighter lasted for seven hours on me before turning a bit patchy and migrating, though I also noticed it was more prone to breaking down foundation faster than the average highlighter/blush.",B
MAKE UP FOR EVER,I544 PINK GRANITE,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark mauve with strong, warm undertones and a frosted sheen. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, blendable texture that wasn‚Äôt too dense nor was it too soft or powdery in the pan. It applied evenly to bare skin and was easy to work with. The color wore well for 10 hours on me before fading noticeably. The color, however, was completely different compared to the previous formula (see side-by-side comparison).",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,S606 PINKY EARTH,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium brown with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had rich pigmentation that applied fairly evenly to bare skin and blended out with minimal effort. The texture could have been slightly more yielding and less dense, as I needed to use flat, synthetic brushes to pickup and apply this the best. It wore well for nine hours on me before fading a bit. The original shade was an Iridescent finish, but functionally, it was slightly richer and creamier in feel (see side-by-side comparison).",B
MAKE UP FOR EVER,I834 GRAPE,Eyeshadow,"a dark plum with warm, brown undertones and multi-colored pearl. It had opaque pigmentation that applied evenly to bare skin and blended out easily along the edges for a diffused look. The consistency was moderately dense but not stiff to work with and I had no trouble getting product onto my brush. This shade stayed on well for almost 10 hours on me before fading slightly. The color was much warmer and deeper compared to the original formula (see side-by-side comparison).",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M806 ANTIQUE PINK,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium pink with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly to bare skin and blended out easily. The consistency was smooth and velvety without being dusty or powdery but still had good adhesion without primer. It was a bit lighter and was less dry compared to the original formula (see side-by-side comparison). On me, it lasted well for nine hours.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,D750 FROSTED PEACH,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium coral with warm, orange undertones and a sparking, metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a drier, firmer texture that was stiffer to work with and made it a challenge to pickup product onto the brush and have it translate evenly to bare skin. The eyeshadow stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me. The original shade was more shimmery, creamier, and more pigmented but very similar in color (see side-by-side comparison).",D+
MAKEUP REVOLUTION,LIQUID ROSE GOLD,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, coppery brown with warm, red undertones and a metallic sheen. The base color seemed to sheer out quite a bit when used on its own, even when I patted the product into place initially and appeared more like a light-medium, warm pink. There was subtle color but not intense nor opaque despite trying to pat on a second and third layer. The consistency was lightweight, thin but not too watery, and easy to blend and spread on the skin. It did not lift up base products but sat well on both bare skin as well as made-up skin. It wore well for nine hours on me before fading noticeably.",B+
COVER FX,AURORA,Highlighter,"a cooler, pinky-gray base that shifted from silver to pink opal. It had a sheerer liquid base that felt watery and thin, but it spread exceptionally well over bare skin and over foundation with even distribution of the glittery bits and bobs. I preferred to put a droplet on the back of my hand, then used my finger to pat the product onto my cheekbones and lightly blend and spread as needed. The glitters were finer, which helped them adhere more evenly to my skin and seemed to ensure that it looked reflective and sparkly but not gritty or dirt-like when the light wasn‚Äôt reflecting off of them. It had buildable coverage from semi-sheer to mostly opaque (two to three layers). This shade wore well for nine hours as a cheek highlighter with a few sparkles that had strayed over time.",A
MAKEUP REVOLUTION,LIQUID STARLIGHT,Highlighter,"a light pink with warm undertones and a fine, metallic sheen. It had semi-sheer to nearly opaque coverage with a smooth, lightweight texture that felt thin and lightly emollient between my fingertips. The highlighter spread evenly across the skin without lifting up my base (and worked well over bare skin or mixed with foundation/primer) when I patted it onto my cheekbones with my fingertips. The consistency was thin enough to mix well with other products but had enough slip and density to slide well over bare skin or as a standalone product. It gave a strong, almost metallic sheen to my skin with a pale pink color. This shade stayed on well for nine hours on me.",A
TOO FACED,MELTED GOLD,Lipgloss,"a rich, molte gold with warm, copper undertones and a glossy, metallic sheen. It had buildable coverage from medium (one layer) to fully opaque (two layers), which was in line with the brand‚Äôs marketing. The consistency was smooth and mostly non-sticky initially, but as the gloss set, it felt a bit thinner and was very sticky. On the upside, the gloss sat well on m y lips‚Äìit didn‚Äôt gather noticeably into my lip lines and the finish was ridiculously shiny, which gave the illusion of smoother lips.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,S314 NILE GREEN,Eyeshadow,"a light green with subtle, warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had good color coverage in a single layer, though the denser, thicker texture made it harder to apply evenly on the skin and had a tendency to look patchy as a result. If I packed it on with a flat, synthetic brush enough, I could get visibly opaque coverage in person but not perfect in close-up photos. The consistency was rather dense and needed a heavier touch to pickup product well. It lasted for eight and a half hours on me before creasing faintly. The original shade was more shimmery and even lighter with better coverage and evenness in application (see side-by-side comparison).",C
MAKE UP FOR EVER,S312 MINT GREEN,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium grass green with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had good pigmentation with a smooth, dense consistency that could have been more yielding to a brush and for overall application, as it was thicker and didn‚Äôt apply as evenly as I expected. It blended out fairly easily, but it was just hard to get really even, opaque coverage on the lid. It lasted for nine hours on me. The original shade was more muted and much cooler in undertone see side-by-side comparison).",B-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,D236 LAGOON BLUE,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, bluish-teal with a sparkling, metallic finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage in one pass, w hich was harder to build up as the texture was denser and a bit stiff to work with, which resulted in more uneven coverage on the lid. With enough effort, I could get the eyeshadow to appear even and mostly opaque on the lid (without primer), but this particular shade is a lot less pigmented and intense compared to the previous formulation (see side-by-side comparison). The eyeshadow wore well for nine hours on me.",C-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,ME302 PEACOCK,Eyeshadow,"a deep, reddish brown base with blue-to-teal shifting shimmer. It had rich color coverage in a single layer with a smooth, moderately dense consistency that wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin, so it was easy to pickup with a brush and blend out along the edges. It lasted well for almost 10 hours on me. The original shade was a bit brighter and more shimmery, so it also appeared lighter (see side-by-side comparison).",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M214 ULTRAMARINE BLUE,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium-dark cobalt blue with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation with a soft, lightly dusty consistency that was smooth and velvety to the touch without being powdery on the lid. The eyeshadow blended out fairly easily and stayed on well for nine hours on me. The original shade was completely different: brighter, lighter, shimmery, and warmer (see side-by-side comparison).",B-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,S300 PINE GREEN,Eyeshadow,"a muted, deep green-leaning teal with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had good pigmentation that applied evenly to bare skin and blended out well, though it appeared lighter and less intense on the lid/skin compared to the pan of product (and it did not deepen with more layers of product). The consistency was denser and a little thick, which made it stiffer to work with in the pan, but at least the blending wasn‚Äôt impacted. It wore well for nine hours on me. The original shade was bluer-based and more shimmery with a better texture and payoff (see side-by-side comparison).",B
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M208 BABY BLUE,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium, cyan blue with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque color payoff with a soft, smooth texture that wasn‚Äôt too thin or too thick nor did it feel powdery in the pan. The color blended out easily, but it was hard to get a truly even, diffused edge of this shade on its own but it paired well with the deeper blues in the range. This shade lasted for nine hours on me on before fading slightly. The original shade was lighter, brighter, and shimmery as it was a Satin finish before (see side-by-side comparison).",B
MAKE UP FOR EVER,I414 YELLOW IVORY,Eyeshadow,"a light beige with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin. I had no trouble blending or diffusing the edges. The texture was soft to the touch, smooth and denser but not stiff or difficult to pickup with a brush. It wore well for 10 hours on me before fading slightly. The new version had a more subdued finish and less yellow (see side-by-side comparison).",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M126 CHALK,Eyeshadow,"a light white with neutral-to-cool undertones and a matte finish. I noticed this shade sometimes appeared grayish when I applied it on my skin tone, so it wasn‚Äôt quite as stark as I expected it to be. The texture was soft, blendable, and a touch dusty in the pan but did not appear dry on the lid and did not have a lot of fallout during application when I tried it on the brow bone either. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that wasn‚Äôt too buildable without a primer underneath. It stayed on well for nine hours on me. The new version is not as bright and not as cool-toned (see side-by-side comparison).",B
MAKEUP REVOLUTION,UNICORN ELIXIR,Highlighter,"a sheer base with iridescent blue and violet sparkle and micro-glitter. This shade was less like the others‚Äìit was sheerer, not really buildable, and had larger sparkle overall. The consistency had a bit more slip as well, though it applied easily onto the skin and spread out evenly. It took about 30 seconds to dry down but did not remain tacky or wet. The effect was subtle with more of the sparkles noticeable in person than in photos. I also found that this worked better combined with a cheek color to ensure the nuance of the shimmer showed up. As a standalone highlighter, it wore well for seven and a half hours on me.",C+
CHANEL,ENTUSIASTA (164),Lipstick,"a bright, medium red with warm, orange undertones and a soft sheen. It‚Äôs a liquid lipstick, which went on with a thin, watery consistency that developed into a lightly tacky, more gel-like finish (but still thin and not truly gel-like, as it lacked the plushness of a gel). It had good pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly accross the lips and didn‚Äôt settle heavily into my lip lines. It was comfortable to wear during the seven and a half hours it lasted for.",A
CHANEL,ETEREA (166),Lipstick,"a soft, light-medium peach with warm, pink undertones and a satin finish. It seemed to have very fine, pearlescent shimmer strewn throughout the product, though it did not appear noticeably shimmery in person. It had sheer coverage, which wasn‚Äôt buildable, and it did not apply as evenly as expected. The texture was thin and watery when it initially went on, but then it set to a thinner consistency that was lightly tacky and more transfer-resistant. It lasted for four hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",C
MAKE UP FOR EVER,D504 CELESTIAL BEIGE,Eyeshadow,"a light gold with warm undertones and a sparkling finish. It had semi-sheer to medium coverage when built up with a denser, drier texture that wasn‚Äôt as easy to pickup nor was it as easy to blend out evenly. The sparkles tended to dislodge from the powder when I blended it out. It wore well for nine hours but had some fallout over time. The new shade was less pigmented and less shimmery, which made it appear darker overall (see side-by-side comparison).",D+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,ME400 BUTTERCUP,Eyeshadow,"a bright, sunshine yellow with warm undertones and a metallic finish. It had rich pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin. The texture was slightly creamy, moderately dense but not stiff or difficult to pickup with most brushes. The eyeshadow was easy to apply and blend out along the edges. It stayed on well for 10 and a half hours on me. The new version is slightly less shimmery compared to the original with a less thick texture (see side-by-side comparison).",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,I722 MANDARIN,Eyeshadow,"a medium orange with warm, golden shimmer. The consistency was smooth to the touch, dense but not stiff to work with, and blendable, though it lacked the creaminess of the original formula. It had opaque pigmentation but had to be used with a firmer, stiffer brush or heavy hand, as it had a tendency to skip on the skin during initial application. It wore well for nine and a half hours on me. The new version is darker, more red-toned, and more muted compared to the original shade (see side-by-side comparison).",B
MAKE UP FOR EVER,I702 MAHOGANY,Eyeshadow,"a medium brown with warm, orange undertones and a pearly sheen. It had rich color payoff that applied evenly and smoothly on my bare lid and blended out with ease along the edges but did not lose its intensity, though the color itself was lighter than the pan color by a good bit. The texture was smooth, velvety, and dense without being too thick or too stiff in the pan. The eyeshadow stayed on well for 10 hours before fading noticeably. The new version is slightly more muted and less shimmery with less creaminess with respect to texture (see side-by-side comparison).",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,D826 FIG,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, reddish plum with warm undertones and a metallic sheen that had flecks of larger sparkle strewn throughout. The consistency was denser in the pan, and it took heavier pressure to pickup product on my brush, but it blended out a lot better than I expected on the lid. It seemed to ‚Äúmelt‚Äù slightly as I worked it on my lid along the edges. It had opaque color payoff that wore nicely for 10 hours with very little fallout. The new shade is very similar in color to the previous formula, but the consistency of the original formula was creamier and thicker (see side-by-side comparison).",B
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M720 APRICOT,Eyeshadow,"a medium orange with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had excellent pigmentation with a smooth, velvety consistency that wasn‚Äôt too soft nor was it too firmly pressed in the pan, which made it easy to pickup and nearly effortless to blend along the edges. The color went on evenly and did not lose its intensity after initial application. It stayed on well for 10 hours before fading slightly. The new version is darker and less yellow-toned with a better texture, as it was less powdery (see side-by-side comparison).",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M847 BURGUNDY,Eyeshadow,"a deep red with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that was fairly blendable on the skin (pretty good for this type of shade). It had a smooth, velvety consistency that wasn‚Äôt too soft nor too firmly pressed in the pan, so I didn‚Äôt have tons of fallout nor was there a lot of powderiness in the pan. This shade wore well for 10 hours on me (both eyes and cheeks). The color is very consistent between old and new, though the texture of the new formula was more blendable for me while pigmentation was weaker (but buildable) (see side-by-side comparison).",B
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M405 STRAW YELLOW,Eyeshadow,"a light yellow with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage in a single layer with a smooth, blendable texture that wasn‚Äôt too powdery in the pan but wasn‚Äôt too firmly pressed in there either. The eyeshadow applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin and the powder didn‚Äôt sheer out too readily (which was what surprised me the most). On me, it stayed on well for nine and a half hours. The new shade has a matte finish (instead of a satin finish), but the colors are actually quite close‚Äìbut the quality is higher in the new formula (see side-by-side comparison).",A
TOO FACED,CHOCOLATE GOLD,Bronzer,"a medium brown with warm, yellow undertones and a fine, golden shee4n. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, soft, and velvety texture that wasn‚Äôt too firmly pressed in the pan, so it was easy to blend out on the skin, but it wasn‚Äôt so soft that it was powdery in the pan. The powder applied evenly to my face, and it took little effort to diffuse the edges. It had a noticeable shimmer in its finish, but it did not accentuate my skin‚Äôs natural texture. On me, it lasted for eight and a half hours before fading slightly. The powder does have a sweet, chocolatly scent.",A
CHANEL,L'ARISTROCATICA (65),Lipstick,"a medium coral with warm, orange undertones and a satin finish. It was shinier than most of the Rouge Allure Velvets I‚Äôve tried, and it was a lot less pigmented and did not apply evenly. There was subtle streakiness along the edges of my lips, but the product also pulled into my lip lines from the get-go. The consistency was smooth and velvety, which made it comfortable to apply and to wear, but it just did not appear that flattering on. On me, it lasted for four hours and was lightly hydrating on.",C+
CHANEL,L'INDOMABILE (66),Lipstick,"a rich, deep red with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. The pigmentation was semi-opaque in a single layer, and it did not seem to build up much beyond that‚Äìit was never full coverage. The lipstick felt smooth, velvety, and thin without being clingy as it skated across my lips with ease. The color went on evenly and stayed on well for six hours, though it felt non-drying over time.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,D562 TAUPE PLATINUM,Eyeshadow,"a dark taupe-brown with subtle, warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. It had opaque pigmentation with a smooth, moderately dense consistency that was blendable on the skin and had minimal fallout. The color went on evenly and lasted for nine and a half hours on me. It had finer pearl and larger sparkle, and it was much darker compared to the previous formula (see side-by-side comparison).",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,S622 BLACK BROWN,Eyeshadow,"a deep brown with subtle, pinkish undertones andd a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly on bare skin. The consistency was dense, smooth to the touch, and rather blendable along the edges, though I did feel like I needed to be more heavy handed in order to dislodge product from the surface of the powder. On me, it stayed on well for 10 hours. The color was much darker and cooler in overall tone compared to the previous formula (see side-by-side comparison).",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,D830 BLACK ROSE,Eyeshadow,"a deep black with neutral-to-warm undertones and a smattering of purple and violet sparkle. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer with a denser, firmer texture that took a heavier hand and some pushing with my brush to pickup product decently. It blended out better than I expected, but it could have been more yielding. This shade wore well for nine and a half hours on me. This shade in the previous formula was more pigmented, creamier, and better overall but very similar in color (see side-by-side comparison).",B-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M546 DARK PURPLE TAUPE,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark mauve with warm, rosy undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation in a single layer, which was buildable to opaque coverage with a second layer. The texture was soft, smooth, and blendable without being too powdery or too thin to use well on bare skin. The color started to fade on me after nine and a half hours of wear. The new formula‚Äôs shade is slightly warmer with a less powdery consistency (see side-by-side comparison).",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,I102 ONYX,Eyeshadow,"a deep black with a pearly sheen. It was richly pigmented and had a smooth, moderately dense consistency that was easy to blend out and apply to bare skin. It was lovely to work with whether I wanted it packed onto the lid or used to darken the crease. The eyeshadow wore well for 10 hours on me before fading slightly. The new version is slightly more shimmery compared to the previous formula, where the color had a Satin finish (but in terms of color, they were very similar) (see side-by-side comparison).",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,I524 PINKY BEIGE,Eyeshadow,"a light peach with warm, orange undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was somewhat buildable but was only opaque if I used it with a dampened brush. The texture was moderately dense but not stiff, so the eyeshadow still blended out nicely along the edges. It lasted well for nine hours on me but had a smidgen of fallout over time. The new version is much warmer‚Äìless pink‚Äìcompared to the previous formula‚Äôs shade (see side-by-side comparison).",C+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M500 IVORY,Eyeshadow,"a light beige with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. The power had a smooth, velvety texture with very little powderiness in the pan. It had good color coverage in a single layer, and as the consistency was a little thicker overall, it didn‚Äôt sheer out too readily on the skin. It wore well for nine and a half hours on me. The new version seemed to be slightly yellower in tone (see side-by-side comparison).",B+
TOO FACED,DIAMOND FIRE,Highlighter,"a bright, iridescent white with a luminous sheen sheen. It shifted between cooler blue and cooler violet and had a slightly buildable luminosity‚Äìone or two layers was subtle, more pearlescent in finish, and two to three layers yielded a more metallic, shinier finish. The consistency was smooth to the touch, but it was a denser firm, which meant no excess product kicked up when used with a brush but I was still able to pickup product with my brush easily. The powder was finely-milled, flattering on the skin as it did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture, and blendable. It had opaque color coverage that lasted for nine hours on me.",A
CHANEL,VERDERAME (824),Eyeshadow,"a blackened teal with subtle, warmer green undertones and a fine, pearly sheen. It had good pigmentation in a single layer, though it wasn‚Äôt fully opaque. It could be built up as long as I waited for the initial layer to dry down fully. The cream eyeshadow had a smooth, almost sponge-like consistency that felt wet to the touch but set fast enough not to settle into lines or gather in my creases. The deeper color made it less easy to use as a sheer wash of color, as the base tended to look patchy when I sheered it out. On me, it lasted well for 14 hours before creasing faintly.",A-
CHANEL,FOSCHIA ROSA (430),Eyeshadow,"a vibrant, medium-dark coral with warm undertones and a barley-there shimmer over a matte finish. The shimmer seemed to aid in blending and giving it a natural matte finish on the skin (matte but not flat or dry). It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation (and the formula is supposed to be more buildable) with a soft, velvety texture that wasn‚Äôt so soft that it was powdery or dusty in the pan. I had no trouble diffusing the edges and blending out the powder on my cheeks. This shade lasted well for nine hours on me before fading noticeably.",A-
CHANEL,VIBRANTE (182),Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium-dark red with warm, orange undertones and a satin finish. It had good color coverage, though it wasn‚Äôt full coverage, and the coverage did not seem to build up. The consistency was smooth, ultra lightweight, and thin without feeling clingy or dry. The formula was lightly hydrating over the six hours the lipstick lasted for on my lips.",A
CHANEL,INCANTEVOLE (184),,"a medium-dark, raspberry pink with subtle, cool undertones and a soft sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer. The lipstick felt lightly creamy with a smooth, thin texture that glided across the lips fluidly and never felt clingy, yet it did not slide around or feather beyond my lips. This shade stayed on well for five and a half hours and was moisturizing over time.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,D716 CRYSTALLINE PAPAYA,Eyeshadow,"a light, peachy white with subtle, warm undertones and flecks of pink and gold sparkle. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage with two layers or a dampened brush. The texture was drier to the touch and felt denser than the previous version, and the previous version was creamier and had a bit less fallout over time as well (see side-by-side comparison). The new version blended out well and lasted for 10 hours on me but had slight fallout over time.",B
MAKE UP FOR EVER,I538 PEARLY GRAY BEIGE,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium, golden brown with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had excellent pigmentation with a smooth, lightly creamy texture that applied beautifully to the skin and diffused easily along the edges. The texture was moderately dense in the pan but not too firmly nor too softly pressed in the pan, which made for easy application. It wore well for 10 hours on me before creasing faintly. The new version is slightly lighter and more shimmery than the original shade (see side-by-side comparison).",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,ME554 GUNMETAL,Eyeshadow,"a medium, taupe-brown with subtle, warm undertones and a cooler, silvery metallic sheen. It had rich color coverage in a single layer, which applied evenly and smoothly to my lid. The texture was moderately dense, creamy enough to blend out nicely on the lid but did not feel thick or heavy on the lid. It wore well for 10 and a half hours on me before fading a bit. The color was very similar to the previous version, though I‚Äôd say the finish wasn‚Äôt quite as shiny (see side-by-side comparison).",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,D652 CELESTIAL EARTH,Eyeshadow,"a deep bronze with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It was richly pigmented and had a smooth, lightly creamy texture that felt dense without being too thick or too heavy on the lid. The eyeshadow applied evenly to my bare skin and blended out with ease. This shade wore well for just over 10 and a half hours on me. They were more similar in person (compared to the side-by-side), but the new version was definitely darker and slightly more red-toned overall (see side-by-side comparison).",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M738 AUBURN,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark rusty copper with warm, red undertones and a matte finish. It had opaque pigmentation with a smooth, soft consistency that was blendable and easy to work with on bare skin. The color lasted well for 10 hours on my lids as well as cheeks before fading noticeably. The color seemed to be slightly more red-based in the new formula, while the finish had more of a ‚Äúnatural matte‚Äù appearance‚Äìless dry, less flat‚Äìcompared to the original formula, and I found the new formula to be more blendable on the eye (see side-by-side comparison).",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M608 RED BROWN,Eyeshadow,"a muted, dark brown with subtle, warm red undertones and a matte finish. The pigmentation was good, though not quite opaque in one layer but was buildable to opaque coverage with a second layer. The consistency was soft, a smidgen dusty but rather smooth and almost velvety to the touch. The eyeshadow blended out easily on the lid with little effort and combined well with the various finishes in the range. On me, it wore well for 10 hours before fading slightly. The original shade was slightly warmer and more pigmented, though the new formula blended out more easily on bare skin for me (the two were about the same over primer) (see side-by-side comparison).",A
COVER FX,LUNAR,Highlighter,"a multi-colored, glittery highlight that seemed to reflect and sparkle in hues of aqua, mint green, blue, violet, and pink. Predominantly, it looked like a bluish lavender on my skin tone but was rather multi-dimensional. It had a sheer, watery base where the majority of the coverage came in the form of glitter‚Äìit was semi-sheer and buildable to semi-opaque. The glitter was fine enough that it sat well on the skin, ‚Äúpigmented‚Äù enough that it didn‚Äôt look like random grit or sand when it wasn‚Äôt reflecting light. It wore well over bare skin, on top of foundation/blush, or mixed in with moisturizer. It was easiest to check for longevity as a highlighter on bare skin, and it lasted well for eight and a half hours with minimal migration.",A
WET 'N' WILD,LIGHTS OUT,Eyeshadow,"the ‚Äúsmoky‚Äù quad out of the bunch with a light, shimmery beige, deep taupe and black, and a smoky, shimmery green. The quality was a little all over the place in the quad, though nothing was amazing without a solid primer underneath it. I still found that, while primer helped, the formula faded far faster than a lot of other formulas on the marketplace (including the previous version).",C+
WET 'N' WILD,HALOGRAPHIC,Highlighter,"a light lavender with cool undertones and a fine pearl. Of all seven shades, this one was the least shimmery and most subtle on the skin. It had sheer to medium color coverage, depending on how much was applied and if it was layered. I felt like this one had more of an iridescent sheen to it, which made it work better combined with a cheek color rather than on its own.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,D552 CRYSTALLINE GRAY BEIGE,Eyeshadow,"a light, golden pewter with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good pigmentation that was buildable to opaque coverage with a moderately dense, smooth consistency that didn‚Äôt kick up any excess product in the pan but still was easy to pickup with my brushes. It was darker and warmer compared to the shade in the previous formula (see side-by-side comparison), while the consistency yielded better in the new formula and wasn‚Äôt as thick, but I found they blended equally well and applied similarly to the lid‚ÄìI didn‚Äôt notice much of a difference in practice. On me, it lasted for 10 and a half hours before creasing faintly.",A-
WET 'N' WILD,I328 BRONZE,Eyeshadow,"a medium, olive green with warm, golden undertones and a pearly sheen. It had opaque pigmentation in a single layer with a smooth, moderately dense and slightly firm texture. There was no excess product that kicked up in the pan, but I felt like it needed a slightly heavier hand to pickup product well onto my brush (but I didn‚Äôt feel I needed to change my brush or overall technique for application). The color is significantly different in the new formula than the old one, as the new formula is much, much lighter and yellower (see side-by-side comparison). The eyeshadow applied nicely to bare skin and blended out with ease. It wore well for 10 hours on me before fading slightly.",A
WET 'N' WILD,ME614 GRAPHITE BROWN,Eyeshadow,"a deep, chocolaty brown with subtle, warm red undertones and a frosted sheen. It was intensely pigmented and had a smooth, lightly creamy texture that was dense but not too thick or heavy on the lid, so it did not emphasize my lid‚Äôs texture. The new version is slightly darker but find I can only tell the difference through photos (based on how the light bounced off the shimmer) and not at all in person, while the texture wasn‚Äôt as dense or as thick as the previous formulation (see side-by-side comparison). The eyeshadow applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin, blended out nicely, and stayed on well for almost 11 hours on me.",A+
WET 'N' WILD,M322 KHAKI,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, mossy green with subtle, warm olive undertones and a matte finish. The pigmentation was very nearly opaque in a single layer and easily built up to opaque coverage using a heavier hand or applying a pat of additional product on top. The consistency was smooth and velvety to the touch and felt like it had a little more slip than the previous formula, which had run a little drier and slightly powdery at times. In terms of color, the new formula is deeper and slightly warmer in tone (see side-by-side comparison). The new formula was easy to apply and blend out on the lid. On me, the color wore well for 10 hours.",A-
WET 'N' WILD,D326 BLACK BRONZE,Eyeshadow,"a blackened brown with soft, warmer undertones and a sparkling sheen. It had excellent color coverage in a single layer that adhered evenly and smoothly to bare skin. The color was more intense and warmer but similar in finish compared to the shade in the previous formula (see side-by-side comparison), while the performance was unchanged‚Äìboth applied beautifully to the skin, blended out with ease, and lasted for awhile (11 hours with the new formula).",A+
WET 'N' WILD,M518 NUDE,Eyeshadow,"a medium beige with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. The color appeared more neutral, almost cool-toned in the pan, but it went on lighter and warmer on me (I triple checked in person!). The texture was smooth and velvety to the touch without any powderiness or dryness. The previous formula‚Äôs shade was slightly cooler-toned and darker (more true-to-pan in color) (see side-by-side comparison). This shade wore well for nine and a half hours on me.",A-
WET 'N' WILD,M510 VANILLA,Eyeshadow,"a soft yellow with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good color coverage in a single layer, though it needed two layers for opaque coverage. The consistency was soft and smooth to the touch with just a touch of powderiness if I really pushed at the surface, but it was less powdery and had more slip than the original formula. The new shade is slightly less orange-based than the shade in the previous formula (see side-by-side comparison). It stayed on well for nine hours o me.",B
WET 'N' WILD,I514 PINK IVORY,Eyeshadow,"a soft, golden beige with a subtle, pink shimmer-sheen finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation with a denser texture that was thin but not stiff or difficult to blend out on the skin. I found it felt and looked quite different than the shade in the previous formula, as the new version is deeper, yellower, and more metallic than pearly with a firmer, thinner consistency (see side-by-side comparison). This shade wore well for 10 hours on me.",B+
COLOUR POP,ILUVSARAHII 2,Palette,"a gloss and two liquid lipsticks. Each shade can be purchased individually if desired, which is something I really appreciate ColourPop doing. The gloss was a disappointment with respect to how it was described (opaque, and it was rather sheer), but the two liquid lipsticks were quite nice. I imagine if someone likes sheer gloss, Atole will be just fine!",B+
WET 'N' WILD,SWEET AS CANDY,Palette,"three neutral-hued shades and a pop of pink. Three of the four shades were shimmery, though only one was on the more frosted/obvious side. This was one of the better-performing quads from the line-up as the eyeshadows were pigmented, blendable, and wore decently on their own.",B+
MELT COSMETICS,GOLD ORE,Highlighter,"a medium gold with warm, orange undertones and a sparkling finish. There were larger sparkles/micro-glittrers in the powder, so while it had a shinier, metallic finish, there were noticeable sparkles that sat on the skin, too. The texture was smooth to the touch but dense and firmer, so there was no excess product kicked up but a moderately dense or moderate-to-heavy hand was needed to pickup product. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that applied evenly to bare skin and blended out well. The powder emphasized my skin‚Äôs texture just slightly when worn at semi-opaque or higher coverage. It wore well for eight hours on me.",B
COLOUR POP,MORNING GLORY,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark berry with subtle, cool undertones and a metallic sheen with faint sparkle. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips. The liquid lipstick had a lightweight, thin, spreadable consistency that wasn’t watery but never felt heavy or thick going on. Because it doesn’t have the total dry-down of the Ultra Matte formula, it has more flexibility and is more comfortable to wear. This shade wore nicely for six hours and was neither drying nor hydrating over time.",A
COLOUR POP,NUMBUS,Lipstick,"a deep plum with warmer undertones and a metallic sheen. The texture was thin but had moderate slip–it felt a little oily to me with how it slid across my lips during application. The color applied patchily to the inner portion of my lips and sank into my lip lines noticeably. The pigmentation was decent, but it was surprisingly under-pigmented compared to most of ColourPop’s liquid lipsticks (and it was supposed to be pigmented). It wore lasted well for five and a half hours, but there was some additional product that sank into my lip lines over time, though the formula itself wasn’t drying at least.",C+
COLOUR POP,MAKE BELIEVE,Lipstick,"a bright, periwinkle blue with cool undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, while the consistency was lightweight, smooth, and spreadable but seemed to have a bit more slip. That extra slip made it pull away slightly along my lip lines and appeared “cracked” when I smiled. The liquid lipstick was comfortable to wear, as it didn’t slide around, and after an hour or so, it had minimal transfer. It stayed on well for over six hours and didn’t feel drying over time but did settle into my lip lines a bit over time.",B+
COLOUR POP,PITTER PONDER,Lipstick,"a brighter, medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. The color coverage was good, though it wasn’t opaque, and there was moderate slip to the formula that made it harder to apply evenly, so there were faint, but visible, streaks along the edges of my lips. The liquid lipstick separated along my lip lines with some product settling there, which was noticeable in person and worsened slightly over time. It wore well for five and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,LIQUID SUN,Highlighter,"a translucent base with fine white and silver pearl. Against my skin tone, the fine pearl catches the light so well that it almost looked like micro-glitter yet I couldn’t see individual particles so much as a sheen and a glimmer as the light reflected off of my skin. I did, occasionally, see almost pink pearl, though I’m not certain that it wasn’t just a trick of the light. The liquid highlighter had a thin, water-gel like texture–more water-like than a thicker, gel, but it had enough substance to it that it spread easily across my skin evenly and with good dispersion. It dried down and set to a more powder-like finish within 30 seconds of blending and spreading the product out on my cheek bones.

The liquid highlighter applied well to bare skin and gently patted on top of liquid foundation with fingertips or with a duo-fiber cheek brush. I preferred using a brush with this particular formula as it seemed to spread and blend out well but was more foolproof to avoid accidentally lifting up my foundation. It yielded a noticeable sheen to my skin with slight pearlescent; it was a light-to-moderate highlighter, so if you tend to find liquid highlighters too subtle, this might work for you but if you’re often looking for the most barely-there pearl, this will likely be too shimmery. When I mixed it in with foundation, it added all-over luminosity but medium coverage foundation kept it from veering into territory where I could actually see pearl all-over. On its own, the product stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me.",A
KAT VON D,METALMATTE,Palette,"a new, limited edition miniature-sized version of the previously-released, limited edition MetalMatte palette. The mini version includes some shades from the brand’s Metal Crush range that were not in the original MetalMatte palette, but those with larger Kat Von D stashes may find they already own every shade in the palette in some other variation. I felt like a few of the mattes were weaker than the originals I have of them, while others performed the same (which wasn’t outstanding). The shimmery shades performed the best, while the mattes were more powdery and buildable than richly pigmented.",B+
PAT MCGRATH,EXXOTICA,Lipstick,"a muted, dark purple with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque color payoff in a single layer that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. The consistency was lightly creamy with slight slip but not enough to feel slippery on the lips, which allowed the color to adhere well and last for over seven hours on me. The formula was hydrating on me.",A
PAT MCGRATH,SHE'S SO DEEP,Lipstick,"a deep, red-toned brown with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had good pigmentation, which was buildable to full coverage with a touch more product (only needed in places). The lipstick felt very lightweight but had a light-medium thick consistency that sat well on the lips and applied without dragging or tugging on my lips. It wore well for eight hours and was moisturizing over time.",A
MELT COSMETICS,NOVA,Highlighter,"a medium-dark copper with warm, brown undertones and a luminous sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with less than a layer patted on top. The powder was moderately firm in the pan, smooth, and easy to blend out on the skin–it felt “dry” in a way but wasn’t actually dry or dusty. The finish was luminous enough to catch and reflect light noticeably, but it did not emphasize my skin’s natural texture.",A-
L'OREAL,DAYBREAK,Highlighter,"a light pink with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation and shimmer. The consistency was thin, lightweight, and spreadable, though it felt a little more oily than I‚Äôve encountered with most liquid highlighter formulations. It dried down to a softly luminous finish‚Äìa noticeable glow at times but nothing intense or metallic. The highlighter lasted well for seven hours on bare skin, though it had a tendency to break down my foundation faster than average, so bare skin was where it lasted the longest for me.",B
WET 'N' WILD,WALKING ON EGGSHELLS,Palette,"lighter, neutral shades in a slim compact. This color combination would be ideal for lighter skin tones and someone who prefers warmer, more shimmery shades (three of the four are shimmery). They are decent over primer, but they were a miss without (and the brand marketed the formula as having new and improved staying power, along with blendability and pigmentation).",B-
MELT COSMETICS,STARGAZER,Highlighter,"a light, peachy gold with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good color coverage that was buildable to full coverage in less than half of a layer more. The consistency was soft, just a smidgen dry to the touch, but it blended out really beautifully on the skin and never looked dry. The highlighter had a reflective finish that seemed to smooth out my skin‚Äôs natural texture instead of potentially accentuating it. It lasted for eight hours on me.",A-
PAT MCGRATH,LEATHERETTE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark brown with warm, red undertones and a satin finish. The consistency was smooth, velvety, and just creamy enough not to drag across the lips, but it adhered evenly and well to the lips for long-wear. The lipstick was richly pigmented and lasted for almost eight hours on me with a lightly hydrating formula.",A+
PAT MCGRATH,ANARKISSED,Lipstick,"a deep burgundy with subtle, cool undertones and a glossy finish. It had a lot of slip, which was obvious given how much glossier the finish was along with how translucen tthe color it was. Instead of having opaque coverage, it had semi-opaque pigmentation that did not build up. The color felt more slippery on the lips, too, and I had slight feathering after six hours of wear (though the color hung on for nearly eight hours). The lipstick could have applied better to the lips, though for how emollient it felt, it did not pull into my lip lines as much as it could have.",C+
WET 'N' WILD,PETALETTE,Palette,"nice in theory, and I think the color combination comes together nicely without having to incorporate other shades, but the performance of two of the shades were weak. This wouldn‚Äôt be a product I‚Äôd use without a primer and only recommend to someone who preferred medium to semi-opaque coverage. I felt that the Wet ‚Äòn‚Äô Wild formula was still a weaker formula when used with primer (and I tried several) and regularly faded faster than a slew of other eyeshadow formulations on the market.",C+
WET 'N' WILD,ROSY AND READY,Highlighter,"a medium pink with soft, warm undertones and a frosted sheen. The shimmer was slightly larger in size in this particular shade compared to the others, though it wasn‚Äôt glittery or chunky.",B-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,FLAMING-OH (330),Lipstick,"a medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and fine, pink pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in a single stroke, which applied fairly evenly, but the product had a lot of slip and pulled into my lip lines quite a bit. I also found that as it dried down, the product seemed to shrink and clump up in places. It lasted for eight hours on me and felt non-drying.",C-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,HOW ROUGE (340),Lipstick,"a bright, coral-red with barely-there red pearl. This was the least ‚Äúshimmery‚Äù shade out of the range. The texture was creamy with a lot of slip, but it dried down to a mostly transfer-resistant, matte finish that felt very lightweight. It took about 10 minutes for this shade to dry down, and even after a half hour on my arm, it did not appear matte/dry. This shade had rich color payoff that went on evenly but slipped into my deeper lip lines as it dried down. It wore well for nine hours and felt neither drying nor hydrating.",B-
URBAN DECAY,TROUBLEMAKER,Palette,"a new, limited eyeshadow palette with ten shades‚Äìmostly neutral‚Äìhoused in a cardboard palette. The palette also comes with a travel-sized Troublemaker mascara (which isn‚Äôt featured/reviewed here). The center shade is a split-pan, hence the #1 and #2 you‚Äôll find below. I liked the palette overall, though I wish the palette was slimmer.",B+
COLOUR POP,DEW DROP,Highlighter,"a medium-dark copper with warm, red undertones and a sparkling sheen. The texture had some larger sparkles in it, though it had an overall glowing finish on the skin once blended and buffed on. It did not seem quite as metallic or as ‚Äúblinding‚Äù on the skin as the other two shades. I found this particular shade to have the great pigmentation‚Äìsemi-opaque and buildable from there‚Äìand found that it applied better to my cheeks than my arm (not a total surprise, as my arm is drier and my face is more normal).",A-
WET 'N' WILD,ROSE IN THE AIR,Palette,"a mix of warm-toned neutrals and a pop of mauve and berry. The mattes performed better than the shimmers, which was a good thing since most of the shades in this palette were matte. They were not as pigmented as marketed, though many shades had buildable pigmentation in practice. The formula had a drier feel overall that improves significantly with primer as the eyeshadows don‚Äôt start fading until the ninth hour and are a bit more pigmented upon initial application.",B-
MILK MAKEUP,ANGEL,Lipstick,"a medium-dark copper with warm, brown undertones and fine, multi-colored pearl. It retained a semi-glossy finish for a solid hour or until I pressed my lips together, which seemed to tamp down the glossiness, though the act of pressing and letting my lips peel apart (the texture was very, very tacky) lifted color along the center of my upper and lower lips. The texture was initially smooth and easy to spread across my lips, but it developed into a much tackier, thinner consistency within a few minutes. It had good color coverage that went on evenly. This shade lasted for five and a half hours and felt non-drying, though it wasn‚Äôt comfortable to wear for me.",C
MILK MAKEUP,BUFFY,Lipstick,"a medium-dark plum with subtle, warm undertones and multi-colored pearl. It had semi-opaque color coverage in a single layer with a smooth, spreadable consistency that developed into a tacky, clingy texture that really hugged the lips to the point where it was uncomfortable after an hour of wear. I did not feel like it was actually drying my lips out after removing the product. It remained slightly glossy for an hour or until I pressed my lips together. This shade lasted for six hours on me.",C
WET 'N' WILD,GUILDED GLOW,Highlighter,"a light-medium gold with warm, orange undertones and a metallic sheen. It was a bit too similar to Goddess Glow to my eye (particularly applied) to merit having both in a seven-shade range.",A-
COLOUR POP,TAKE ME HOME,Palette,"a six-pan palette with warm, neutrals‚Äìfour mattes and two shimmers! They are previously-released shades, though I found Issues to be different enough than my previous version to merit a different name (hence the #2!) and ‚ÄúBitter Better‚Äù was labeled ‚ÄúBetter Bitter‚Äù in a past palette‚Äìthey‚Äôre similar enough that I think they‚Äôre supposed to be the same shade but not 100% the same (see below).",B
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,FRAM-BOIS (350),Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark coral-red with warm undertones and fine, pink pearl. It had nearly full color coverage in a single pass, though it seemed to clump up slightly in places as it dried down. The texture felt creamy as it initially applied, but as it dried down, it felt thinner and very lightweight. There was slight color that pulled into my lip lines as the product dried down, though. On me, it lasted for nine hours and was non-drying.",B
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,PLUM N GET IT (360),Lipstick,"a rich, reddish berry with cooler, fuchsia pearl. It had opaque pigmentation in a single stroke, and the color applied evenly across the lips without gathering into my lip lines. The texture was lightweight, creamy initially, and dried down within five minutes to a mostly transfer-resistant finish. The color stayed on well for 10 hours on me (and was non-drying) but did not make it through a second meal.",B+
COLOUR POP,GNOMIE,Highlighter,"a light, golden beige with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. The texture seemed to have slightly larger particles in it, so the powder itself did not seem was finely-milled or as silky in feel as the other two shades released. The powder did, however, apply seamlessly to bare skin but was particularly beautiful over foundation, where it seemed to melt and make my skin appear shiny and smooth. It had medium coverage that was buildable to opaque coverage with less than two layers of product‚Äìit did seem more pigmented when I was actually apply it to my cheekbones than when I swatched it on my arm, though. It stayed on well for eight and a half hours.",B+
WET 'N' WILD,HOOKED ON VINYL,Palette,"three neutrals and a pop of smoky teal. Three of the shades were decent enough, but the deeper teal shade, while pigmented, was a real pain to work with and blend out. It was just the type of texture that stuck very strongly wherever it initially applied and did not want to blend or even out nicely.",B
MILK MAKEUP,SLAYER,Lipstick,"a deep, red plum with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that went on fairly evenly but some color settled into my lips during the initial application. The texture had a light-medium thickness and a smooth feeling as it went on initially, but it developed into a very clingy, tacky consistency that didn‚Äôt shift around but felt like it had sort of ‚Äúset.‚Äù",C
MILK MAKEUP,WILLOW,Lipstick,"a medium-dark purple with warm undertones and fine multi-colored pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a natural sheen that was present for a solid two hours after application, though if I pressed my lips together after an hour of wear, it took away a significant amount of the shine, but color also lifted away from the center of my lips when I did so. The texture was incredibly tacky as it developed and then ‚Äúset‚Äù on the lips, and it felt quite clingy. On me, it wore well for five and a half hours (as long as I minimized pressing my lips together).",C-
COLOUR POP,AURA VOIR,Highlighter,"a medium, coppery orange with warm undertones and fine, gold and copper pearl. It had medium, buildable coverage, though the shine itself was high-shine to truly blinding. The texture was soft, finely-milled, and easy to blend out on the skin. Despite the high-shine finish, it seemed to create the illusion of smoother skin rather than accentuating the texture of my natural skin.",A-
WET 'N' WILD,SILENT TREATMENT,Palette,"a new, permanent set of neutral shades‚Äìmauve, peach, deep taupe, light taupe‚Äìhoused in a slim, plastic palette. They were not the worst eyeshadows I‚Äôve used, but there was a dryness present through the formula that made them harder to use without a good primer underneath.",C+
COLOUR POP,TULIP TO QUIT,Blush,"a medium, burnt orange with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which did not build up to full coverage as the texture was too dry and prone to sheering out to manage any buildability. The consistency seemed to lack binders, so there was a ton of product that kicked up in the pan when I tried to use it, even with a soft touch. It blended out decently but looked somewhat uneven, despite trying to my best to diffuse the coverage. It lasted for seven hours on me.",D+
WET 'N' WILD,GODDESS GLOW,Highlighter,"a medium gold with warm, orange undertones and a fine, pearly sheen. It had medium coverage, which was buildable to nearly opaque coverage with two to three layers (though you‚Äôll want to wait for each layer to dry). I found it photographed and appeared lighter (most of the time) with how well it reflected light back.",A
BOBBI BROWN,BARE PINK,Lipstick,"a medium peach with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had good pigmentation, though it was shy of truly full coverage, that applied evenly but had a fair amount of slip. The added slip made it prone to slipping into my lip lines and made my lips appear more textured overall. This shade lasted for three and a half hours, but it was quite moisturizing at least.",B-
BOBBI BROWN,DESERT ROSE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark mauve with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single stroke, and the color applied evenly across the lips and never tugged. The consistency was lightweight, creamy with some slip, but it adhered well to the lips and stayed on nicely for four and a half hours. The formula felt hydrating over time.",A-
BOBBI BROWN,UBER PINK,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink with warm undertones and a cream finish. The texture was smooth, moderately creamy, and a little thinner, which made it appear less smoothing on my lips than many of the other shades in the formula. There was subtle color that had pulled into my lip lines, though I didn‚Äôt detect that from a normal distance. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that stayed on well for four and a half hours, and the formula felt moisturizing while worn.",A-
COLOUR POP,WHAT WENT DOWN,Palette,"a set of shades that was released in late fall. As always, the shades can be purchased individually as well (and there‚Äôs not much savings if you buy all four ‚Äî only worth it if you‚Äôd use all four), which is a nice touch. The four worked together to create a really stunning look, but with two of the four shades being matte, the foursome might be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea.",A-
MAC,PERFECT BRONZE,Palette,"a brighter pink and a deeper copper housed in the same compact. The compact could be larger to accommodate a blush brush more easily, which would make it more feasible to pick up one color at a time. It was possible, but I used smaller cheek brushes and was mindful of where I put my brush.",B
BOBBI BROWN,HEAT RAY,Eyeshadow,"a rich, medium-dark copper with warm, orange undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. It had good pigmentation both wet and dry, though the dampened application yielded a stronger, foil-like shine and full coverage. The texture was soft, smooth, and not too loose or too firm in the compact, so it was easy to apply to the lid and blend it out. It wore well for eight hours with slight fallout when applied dry and minimal fallout when applied wet.",B+
BOBBI BROWN,MELTING POINT,Eyeshadow,"a deep plum with subtle, warm undertones and a sparkling finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation applied dry as well as damp, though the eyeshadow had more of a sheen when applied with a dampened brush. The texture was soft, blendable, and not too loose nor was it too dense or firm in the pot, which made it easy to pickup product with a brush and blend out. It wore well for eight hours with minimal fallout dry and eight and a half hours when applied wet.",A
BOBBI BROWN,OVERHEATED,Eyeshadow,"a bright, light-medium peachy copper with warm undertones and a metallic finish. It had good color payoff both wet and dry with dampened application yielding a deeper, richer color overall that was extremely shiny. The consistency was soft, a smidgen dusty in the pan, but it applied evenly to bare skin (even dry!) and was easy to work with. It wore well for eight hours dry and almost nine hours when applied damp.",A
COLOUR POP,DREAM ST,Palette,"a warm-toned, neutral palette with a few pops of color (two teals, two oranges). There was a nice mix of matte and shimmer, light and dark to enable one to create several different looks with the palette. I had trouble with some of the more shimmery shades, which was a surprise as ColourPop tends have a reliable, quality formula on their more metallic shades, but they seemed drier in this palette and most needed to be applied with a dampened brush to perform decently.",B
MAC,OPAL BEACH,Lipstick,"a light, peachy gold with warm, golden pearl. It had medium coverage that didn‚Äôt build beyond semi-opaque coverage. The texture was thin, balm-like, and comfortable to wear, though it emphasized every imperfection on my lips and pulled into lip lines immediately and only worsened over time. It lasted for three hours on me (not at all close to the six hours promised!).",D
MAC,SUNSET PEARL,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark peachy brown with warm undertones and barely-there, gold pearl. The consistency was lightweight, balm-like as it had some slip but didn‚Äôt feel heavy like a true cream finish, and was comfortable to wear, though it didn‚Äôt seem to blur my lip lines. It had medium pigmentation that was buildable to mostly opaque coverage. This shade stayed on well for five hours and was hydrating over time.",A-
MAC,ROLLING RED,Lipstick,"a slightly muted, medium-dark red with subtle, cool undertones and a soft, pearly sheen. It had medium coverage that was buildable to semi-opaque pigmentation. The consistency was smooth, lightly creamy without being too thick or too heavy on the lips, and while it glided on without tugging, it seemed to adhere well to the lips for better wear. On me, it wore well for five and a half hours and was hydrating.",A
COLOUR POP,"WHY, HELLO",Blush,"a medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. The blush had a very powdery, almost clumpy, consistency that felt silky to the touch but dry upon application. It had semi-sheer coverage, which was hard to build up as the powder didn‚Äôt adhere to itself well, so I just wasn‚Äôt able to get much more than medium coverage out of it. When I blended it out, the color tended to lift and sheer away, but at least it did not look splotchy. It wore well for six hours before fading noticeably.",F
MAC,MAMASTARRR,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, rosy brown with warm undertones and a satin sheen. It was richly pigmented and had a smooth, lightly creamy texture that glided across the lips without tugging and applied even coverage in a single stroke. The lipstick was comfortable to wear, though there was a touch of color that gathered in my lip lines. It wore well for five hours and was slightly moisturizing.",A-
MAC,PATRICK WOO,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark cherry red with cooler, blue undertones and a semi-matte finish. It was brighter, less matte, and not quite as blue-based as Ruby Woo. The texture was smooth, creamy without being too emollient or wet inf eel, but it didn‚Äôt tug or drag on the lips. It applied evenly with a smidgen of color gathering in my deeper lip lines. This shade stayed on well for over six hours and left a faint stain behind. The formula felt neither drying nor hydrating.",A
MAC,SHE BETTA WERRRK,Lipstick,"a medium pink with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had rich color coverage in a single layer that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips without tugging. The consistency felt more velvety, a little thicker, but it was comfortable to wear and wasn‚Äôt too prone to settling into my lip lines (definitely wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance). It wore well for four and a half hours and was slightly hydrating.",B+
MAC,BURNING NIGHTS,Palette,"a smoky mix of neutrals and a blackened navy blue. If one tends to like MAC‚Äôs Mineralize fomrula, I don‚Äôt think this would fall that short of expectations, but in order to get true-to-pan coverage and intensity, they need to be used with a dampened brush or over a lightly tacky primer.",B-
SHISEIDO,DESERT QUARTZ (RD124),Palette,"a soft, medium pink with strong, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good pigmentation‚Äìnearly opaque coverage in a single layer‚Äìthat applied evenly, but the more velvety texture had a tendency to slip into my lip lines. The consistency was smooth and comfortable to apply and to wear, though. It wore well for four hours and was lightly hydrating.",B
SHISEIDO,CURIOUS CASSIS (RD620),Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark burgundy red with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It was richly pigmented and had a smooth, lightly creamy texture that was a smidgen more emollient compared to other shades in the formula (well, that were more matte). The lipstick glided across lips nicely and applied evenly. It wore well for five and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",A
COLOUR POP,TO THE 10,Blush,"a medium pink with strong, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had medium coverage, which I could build up to mostly opaque coverage with three layers. The blush had a dusty, drier consistency that made it harder to work with on the skin, as it tended to adhere more strongly to some areas and not others, which made blending and diffusing a trying time. For the type of color, one would expect something easy and effortless for everyday, but it took a lot more care to apply and more time to blend it out than many other blush formulass. On me, it wore well for seven hours.",C-
MAC,GOALGETTER,Palette,"a warm-toned set of neutrals with three mattes and one shimmery shade. All four shades are from the permanent range, so they can be purchased individually as well.",B+
COLOUR POP,DREAM TEAM,Palette,"two Ultra Satin Liquid Lipsticks and one lipgloss. The gloss was the weaker shade in the set, though the shades can be purchased individually.",A-
COLOURED RAINE,BOURGEOIS,Highlighter,"a dark, coppery red with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. The texture was denser, a bit cream-like, and very smooth and had no excess powder kicked up in the pan when used. It was richly pigmented and applied evenly to bare skin, blended out with little effort, and didn‚Äôt emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading.",A-
TOO FACED,CHOCOLATE GOLD,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette that features 16 eyeshadows‚Äì13 with shimmer and three that are matte. I think that they could have gone with a more satin-to-pearl finish on the lightest shade (Rollin‚Äô in Dough), as it would pair better with the rest of the shades and could be used to lighten and fade the edges of richer shades in the palette without causing any grayness or tamping down the shimmery finish. Otherwise, the palette was pretty easy to use, lasted well, and had good pigmentation. There were a few shimmery shades that applied more evenly or more intensely using a dampened brush, or if one used primer first.",B+
MAC,MAMASTARRR,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark, rosy brown with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had a smooth, moderately tacky texture that was fairly easy to spread across the lips. The pigmentation was good‚Äìnot quite opaque‚Äìand applied with very minimal streaking, though there was some color that gathered into my lip lines. It wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",B+
MAC,PATRICK WOO,Lipgloss,"a vibrant, medium-dark cherry red with cool, blue undertones and a jelly-like finish. The texture was incredibly smooth and didn‚Äôt seem quite as thick as most Lipglasses, though it was still sticky overall. It had good color coverage in a single layer and applied evenly without emphasizing my lip lines. The gloss lasted for five and a half hours on me and was moisturizing while worn.",A
MAC,SHE BETTA WERRRK,Lipgloss,"a light-medium pink with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered the lips without streaking, but there was a lot of color that pulled into my lip lines. The texture was moderately tacky, smooth, and fairly spreadable on the lips. It wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",B-
BOBBI BROWN,PLUM ROSE,Lipstick,"a rich plum with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. The texture was smooth, creamy, and lightweight without being too thin or too thick on the lips. It had excellent pigmentation that covered the lips evenly in a single layer. It wore well for five and a half hours and was moisturizing over time.",A
BOBBI BROWN,RED BERRY,Lipstick,"a medium-dark burgundy with subtle, cool undertones and a soft sheen. This shade had more slip than most in the range, and it also seemed thinner, which gave it a bit of translucency on the lips. The pigmentation was still closer to full coverage in one layer, but it wasn‚Äôt buildable beyond mostly opaque. It didn‚Äôt feather on me, but it felt more high-maintenance while worn as it didn‚Äôt adhere as well as other shades. It lasted for five hours on me, left a subtle stain behind, and was hydrating.",A-
COLOUR POP,WEIRDOUGH,Blush,"a muted, medium brown with warm, rosy undertones and a matte finish. It had a powder texture that kicked up a lot of excess product in the pan and seemed to come from a drier formula, too, as I felt like it skipped on the skin as I tried to apply and blend it out. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, but it wasn‚Äôt buildable as the powder just seemed to sheer out the more I blended it out. The blush stayed on well for seven hours before fading noticeably on me.",D+
MAC,GLAM AF,Palette,"three matte eyeshadows and one shimmery eyeshadow, and they were all in the neutral family of colors. The shimmery shade was a miss‚Äìtoo dry and too loose to work well on its own (and regular primer wouldn‚Äôt be enough‚Äìit needed a tacky base or to be used with a dampened brush). Three of the four shades are part of the permanent range.",B
SHISEIDO,DUSKY HONEY (BE323),Lipstick,"a medium-dark, peachy brown with warm, orange undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good color coverage in a single stroke, though the texture was prone to separating around my lip lines and later on, the color settled into them as the color wore on. The texture felt more velvety and silicone-heavy than particularly wet or cream-like, so I was surprised it didn‚Äôt smooth out my lips more. This shade stayed on well for four hours and was lightly moisturizing.",C+
SHISEIDO,ROSE SYRUP (BR721),Lipstick,"a medium, taupe brown with subtle, warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque in one pass of the lipstick. It had a smooth, velvety texture that didn‚Äôt feel wet or slippery but still slid easily across the lips without tugging on them during application. The color applied evenly, and there was a faint amount of color that sat in my deeper lip lines in the close-up photo but I couldn‚Äôt detect that in person. It wore well four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",A
SHISEIDO,AMBER AFTERNOON (BR322),Lipstick,"a muted, medium brown with warm, rosy undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had opaque color coverage in a single layer with a smooth, velvety texture that had moderate slip but never felt wet or slippery on the lips. The formula glided on without tugging, felt lightly hydrating, and lasted for five hours on me.",A
COLOUR POP,BARRE HOPPING,Blush,"a light-medium brown with warm, orange undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-sheer, buildable color coverage that was buildable to semi-opaque coverage. The texture was drier and moderately powdery in the pan, though it did not appear dry or chalky on my skin and blended decently. It just barely showed up on my complexion so it might work well for fairer compelxions as a soft bronzer but would likely get lost on deeper skin tones. The blush wore well for seven and a half hours on me.",B-
TARTE,PARK AVE PRINCESS,Palette,"a new palette for spring that features four bronzing powders and two highlighters. The formulas are described as ‚Äúthe blendability of a cream‚Äù with the ‚Äúweightless wear of a powder‚Äù that has ‚Äú12-hour‚Äù wear. The brand didn‚Äôt seem to callout pigmentation specifically, though their swatches show opaque coverage (and it‚Äôs more typical for these types of products to be pigmented than sheer without saying as much). If they‚Äôre the kind of bronzing tones that you go for, the palette was nice overall. I didn‚Äôt have any issues applying or blending out the powders, they lasted between eight and nine hours (which is solid wear, just not 12-hour wear as promised), and there was plenty of product.",B+
COLOURED RAINE,JUST PEACHY,Highlighter,"a bright, medium pink with warmer, golden pearl. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that applied evenly to bare skin. The base of this appeared more like a cheek stain than a typical blush, which may have been partially the result of the creamier feel of the powder itself. I had no trouble blending and diffusing the edges of the highlighter (or blush, depending on your skin tone!) on my cheeks. The shimmer yielded a noticeable glow but didn‚Äôt accentuate my skin‚Äôs natural texture. On me, the highlighter started to fade after eight and a half hours of wear.",A-
MAYBELLINE,CARNAL BROWN,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark taupe brown with warmer undertones and a matte finish. The texture was stiff but did not drag painfully across the lips, though there was tugging and it needed a very firm pressure to yield coverage. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was spreadable solely by pressing and rubbing my lips together. The color wore well for five hours and was lightly drying.",C
MAYBELLINE,CONCRETE JUNGLE,Lipstick,"a dark, purpled taupe with cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had medium coverage, which wasn‚Äôt buildable due to the lipstick have an extremely dense and stiff texture that made it somewhat painful to apply as it dragged and pulled at the lips. The lipstick stayed on well for five hours but was drying over time.",D-
MAYBELLINE,SMOKY JADE,Lipstick,"a muted, deep teal with subtle, cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had semi-sheer pigmentation that applied unevenly to the lips and had a tendency to clump together, which also caused patchiness and color to sit in my lip lines over time. The consistency was extremely stiff, and it was painful to drag it across the lips. This shade lasted for five hours and was lightly drying over time.",F
STILA,JEZEBEL,Eyeshadow,"a rich, medium-dark copper with warm, orange undertones and a pearly sheen. It was richly pigmented and a little went a long way, and I felt like this made it easier to work with as the product never felt too much on the lid, dried down fast enough not to get into my creases, but I was still able to diffuse the edges. On me, it lasted for nine hours without creasing.",A
STILA,STARLIGHT,Eyeshadow,"a light gold with warm, yellow undertones and fine, multi-colored pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation paired with a thin, watery consistency that was prone to sheering out. I did not find the formula to be particularly buildable as the dry down made it budge-proof to the point where layering more product on top tended to make the surface uneven and emphasized my lid texture. This shade worked well for an all-over shimmering effect on the lid or patted on top of other eyeshadows. The eyeshadow lasted for eight and a half hours on me before wearing away.",B
STILA,CLOUD,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, smoky purple with warmer gold and pink pearl. This was one of the more multi-dimensional shades, as it seemed to get warmer and cooler depending on the angle. It was more watery, though, and had semi-opaque pigmentation in a single layer on the lid as it naturally sheered out as I spread the product out. I could build it up slightly, but the dry down was such that it didn‚Äôt layer too well. I think this shade would work best as a one-and-done color on the lid or patted on top of another eyeshadow to fill in the opacity. On me, it lasted for nine hours without creasing and had no fallout.",B-
STILA,LA DOUCE,Eyeshadow,"a dark, greenish-gold with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. It had opaque coverage in a single layer with a slightly watery texture that felt cool upon application. The consistency took some getting used to applying, as it was easy to over-apply due to the thinner, watery feel of it. Once I got a handle on that, I was able to apply it evenly and blend out the edges fairly well. It lasted for nine hours without creasing on me, and it seemed to have the barest amount of fallout.",B+
STILA,PIGALLE,Eyeshadow,"a deep plum with warm, brown undertones and a pearly sheen. The eyeshadow was richly pigmented with a smooth, watery consistency that was thin but not prone to sheering out. A little went a long way‚ÄìI barely tapped my flat brush against the applicator and had plenty of product for a third of my lid. I did find that it was harder to get seamless edges with this shade, particularly once it dried down as it did not budge. It wore well for nine hours before creasing on me.",A
COLOUR POP,NKLA X LAURA LEE,Palette,"a new, limited edition trio of lip colors that includes a gloss, liquid lipstick, and a metallic liquid lipstick. Each shade can also be purchased individually desired. This set, as well as when purchased separately is part of ColourPop‚Äôs partnership with NKLA, and the net profits from the sales of these shades will go toward NKLA.",B
CHANEL,ROSY GOLD (30),Highlighter,"a light-medium peach with warm, orange undertones and flecks of gold sparkle and finer, gold pearl. It had a soft, slightly dusty consistency, though the powder itself felt firmer in the pan (but not stiff or difficult to pickup with a brush or to blend out on the skin). The powder applied easily to my cheeks, diffused almost effortlessly along the edges, and did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture, but I could see the sparkles present on the skin, which I know is a matter of preference. This shade wore well for eight hours on me before starting to fade.",B
MAYBELLINE,NOCTURNAL ROSE,Lipstick,"a medium pink with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation with a tolerably firm texture; it took extra pressure to apply the product, but it was thicker and more forgiving so it actually applied product fairly evenly. There was a chalkiness to the formula, though, that make it emphasize my lip lines over time as color pulled away and settled in them. On me, it wore well for four and a half hours but had noticeable settling by the third hour of wear. The formula was somewhat drying overall.",B-
MAYBELLINE,CRUEL RUBY,Lipstick,"a dark red with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. This was one of the better-applying shades as it was dense and firmer but not quite as stiff, so it wasn‚Äôt painful to apply and was manageable enough to use firmer pressure and get even, nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer. The texture was clingy, though, and did pull into my lip lines over the six hours it lasted for. It left a stain behind and was somewhat drying.",C+
COLOUR POP,MAIN CHICK,Blush,"a rich, medium orange with warm, reddish undertones and a matte finish. The texture was rather powdery‚Äìyou can even see it in the swatch (that only shows up when it‚Äôs very powdery!), which meant a lot of excess product kicked up in the pan when I used it but also made it difficult to control the amount of product on the brush. It was quite pigmented and was difficult to diffuse or sheer down significantly once on the skin, so I would highly recommend using a feathery brush and an ultra-light touch then tapping of the surface of the brush, tapping away excess, and then applying. The powder blended out decently but took some effort to even out on the skin as it seemed to adhere unevenly initially. It wore well for seven and a half hours on me.",C-
KEVYN AUCOIN,ELECTROPOP,Palette,"a new, limited edition 12-pan palette that featurse 11 very shimmery/metallic shades and one more satin shade (Blackout). The formula is described as having ‚Äúone swipe payoff‚Äù with a ‚Äúsmooth texture [that] glides on effortlessly.‚Äù For ‚Äúmaximum color payoff,‚Äù the brand advises to use fingertips for application. The texture of most shades was quite dense, more emollient/cream-like, and worked best with flat, firm or dense synthetic brushes. Fingertips worked well for all-over the lid application, but I felt like a fair amount of product stuck to my fingertip and wouldn‚Äôt transfer well onto my lid as it was too much pressure to do so (compared to using fingertips and applying swatches on an arm, where that amount of pressure is just fine).",B-
MAYBELLINE,PURPLE (100),Highlighter,"a sparkling, pale white base with lavender sparkle and glitter. It had a soft, loosely pressed consistency that was noticeably sparkly/glittery. The flecks adhered decently to bare skin but a fair amount of them disappeared as I blended and spread the product across my cheekbones. It looked more subtle than I expected, but there were moments where it seemed to sparkle quite a bit. I found that it did not really look glittery or shiny until layered over a more contrasting color (like a mid-tone or deeper blush). On me, it was hard to judge wear since it was a lot of sparkle and not much in the way of color, but it seemed to last around six hours but there was noticeably less glitter on my cheekbones then than when I had applied.",D+
GIVENCHY,POURPRE EDGY (326),Lipstick,"a deep red with cool, pink undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied without tugging on the lips, but the color could have been a smidgen more even overall. The translucency to the coverage seemed to make any imperfections in the finish/application more noticeable, unfortunately. The lipstick felt smooth and velvety going on with moderate slip, and for all that slip, it did not accentuate my lip lines and seemed to smooth them out a bit (not as much as other shades in the Le Rouge lineup, though). It wore well for five hours and was moisturizing.",B+
GIVENCHY,PRUNE TRENDY (327),Lipstick,"a medium-dark berry with cool, pink undertones and a cream finish. It had good color coverage in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The consistency was smooth, creamy without being too thick or too thin, and it glided nicely across the lips and yielded even, smooth coverage. The formula was moisturizing to wear, and it seemed to fill in my lip lines a bit rather than gather in them. This shade stayed on well for five hours and left a faint, pinkish stain behind.",A
COLOUR POP,PARAKEET,Blush,"a medium-dark pink with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had opaque color coverage‚Äìnot what I would consider buildable!‚Äìwith a smooth, silky consistency that had some powderiness in the pan but did not appear dry applied to the cheeks. Even with a light hand a mere tap of my brush into the pan yielded a lot of coverage quickly, so the blush would be more suitable for someone who wants higher coverage out of their blushes. The texture seemed creamier and was easier to diffuse along the edges, and I did not struggle with unevenness in the initial application as I have with other shades in the formula. This shade wore well for eight and a half hours before fading noticeably.",B-
CHANEL,IVORY GOLD (10),Highlighter,"a light gold with warm, yellow undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. It had good color payoff in a single layer, though the texture was forgiving and I felt like I could tone down the coverage and shine a bit by using a lighter hand. The highlighter felt smooth to the touch but after a couple of uses, the powder seemed to soften, though it never actually felt stiff.",A-
BOBBI BROWN,BERRY ROSE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, rosy plum with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. It had rich, opaque color payoff in a single stroke. The consistency was creamy with some slip, but it did not feel overly emollient so it did not slide around while worn. It was comfortable to apply and to wear, as it never tugged on the lips and did not feel clingy. This shade stayed on well for five and a half hours and was hydrating over time.",A+
BOBBI BROWN,RICH BERRY,Lipstick,"a deep, purpled berry with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in a single pass of product. The lipstick felt more balm-like and had a lot more slip than a lot of the Luxe lip color range did, which made it very comfortable to wear but gave the lipstick a more slippery feel over time. I didn‚Äôt notice any bleeding outside my natural lip lines, but the amount of slip and richness in color give me pause for someone who may be more prone to feathering (I‚Äôm not). The color lasted nicely for five hours, was moisturizing, and left a subtle stain behind.",B+
BOBBI BROWN,CRIMSON,Lipstick,"a muted, dark burgundy with subtle, warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had good color coverage, though it was not opaque and did not build up to full coverage with additional product layered on top. The texture was thinner and more balm-like, so while it skated easily across the lips, it was harder to control and felt wetter on. It felt slippery on the lips to me, though I did not personally experience feathering/bleeding. It wore well for five hours and left a stain behind, while the formula was lightly hydrating.",B+
COLOUR POP,BOUNCY,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark brown with warm, red undertones and pink and olive pearl. It had a smooth, moderately emollient consistency so it felt wet to the touch and was a little too slippery on the lid, so it did not have fully opaque coverage in one layer and took a little more work to diffuse and blend out. It wore well for 10 hours on me without fading or creasing.",A-
COLOUR POP,FLUFFY,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. The texture was soft, smooth, and fairly blendable, but it was a product that applied most evenly when patted onto the skin with a fingertip over a flat, synthetic brush. I was able to get precision around the edges by going back in with a brush but initial application needed a fingertip for the best results. Once on the lid, it lasted well for 10 hours and seemed to have no fallout over time.",A
COLOUR POP,REVOLUTION,Eyeshadow,"a medium plum with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. The consistency was fairly emollient and had more slip, which gave it a more semi-opaque level of coverage than is typical for the brand‚Äôs cream eyeshadows. It was more blendable, though, along the edges for longer. It wore well for over 10 hours with slight fallout over time.",B+
COLOUR POP,ALL I SEE IS MAGIC,Palette,"15 shades in varying hues and finishes, though it‚Äôs still what I‚Äôd consider to be a more neutral palette. There are two shades that act like pops of color‚ÄìTinsel Town and Wishful Thinking‚Äìso it‚Äôll work for someone who likes their warmer-toned neutrals and has wanted to pair them with some more metallic finishes. It‚Äôs another solid palette from ColourPop, though, as most of the eyeshadows were quite pigmented, easy to apply, and long-wearing.",A-
MAYBELLINE,OPAL (050),Highlighter,"a pale white base with silver to lavender sparkle. It had a glittery, metallic finish with a noticeable texture from the amount of sparkle‚Äìthere wasn‚Äôt a strong base powder, just lots of glittery bits and pieces. It had some shine but it had more of a sparkle that I could see in person. It pressed and patted against the skin, it was fairly pigmented, but as soon as I started to diffuse and blend out the edges, it sheered out quite a bit. It worked best applied over another product, as it seemed to need a more contrasting base to really shine (pun intended, I suppose). The powder felt soft, loose without being too powdery, and it applied fairly evenly. On me, there was a fair amount of glitter that had fallen off or traveled during the six hours it lasted for.",D+
GIVENCHY,FRAMBOISE COUTURE (323),Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool undertones and a cream finish. The color coverage was opaque in a single layer and applied evenly and smoothly across the lips without dragging or tugging during application. It had a velvety texture that wasn‚Äôt too thick, too thin, or too slippery. The color adhered well to the lips and wore nicely for almost six hours.",A
GIVENCHY,CORAIL BACKSTAGE (324),Lipstick,"a bright, medium coral-pink with warm undertones and a glossy sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly, though the more emollient quality of the consistency made it harder to get truly even edges as I felt like ‚Äúlines‚Äù were left the more I tried to fix it (and if I pressed my lips together). The brightness of the color seemed to make those imperfections harder to see in person, though. The consistency was smooth, velvety, and comfortable to wear and to apply, and I felt like it made my lips appear smoother and less lined, too. It lasted for four hours on me and was hydrating.",B+
GIVENCHY,ROUGE FETICHE (325),Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange-red with warm undertones and a glossy, cream finish. It had good color payoff in a single layer, though my lip freckle peeked through. The lipstick felt smooth, slightly balm-like as it glided across my lips with ease, and it deposited even coverage. The lipstick smoothed out my lip lines noticeably, which made them appear fuller. This shade stayed on well for five and a half hours, left a subtle stain behind, and was moisturizing.",A
COLOUR POP,ROMCOM,Blush,"a bright, medium-dark coral with warm, pink undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-sheer, buildable pigmentation that applied decently but did not blend out as nicely as I would have expected. I felt like I had to buff the product in quite a bit, which would disturb base products, so I had to be careful. The best technique I found for applying the blush well was to powder the skin with translucent powder first, and then apply the blush, as this helped it blend better and require less buffing. The powder felt smooth to the touch but was moderately powdery in the pan. On me, it lasted for eight hours.",C+
COLOUR POP,VELVET ROPE,Highlighter,"a light-medium coral with a hint of pink and a soft, frosted sheen. The highlighter had a noticeable shine on the skin but was just shy of pore-emphasizing territory on my skin. The texture was smooth to the touch, easy to pick up with a brush, and remained blendable on the skin. It had good pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage, if desired, with just a touch more layered on top. This shade stayed on well for eight and a half hours before it started to wear away.",A-
FENTY BEAUTY,UNCENSORED,Lipstick,a medium-dark red with neutral undertones and a matte finish. It had opaque pigmentation in a single‚Äìthere was more product on the applicator than necessary for full coverage.,A-
KAT VON D,FAWN,Palette,"a warm-toned, neutral set of eyeshadows‚Äìthree matte and one shimmery‚Äìhoused in a plastic compact. Three of the eyeshadows were more powdery (with one being more ‚Äútolerably‚Äù powdery) and one felt a little dry. They had fairly good pigmentation, though the lightest shade was powdery to the point where it sheered out easily and did not build up. For me, this palette would only make sense for someone who doesn‚Äôt mind powdery eyeshadows and normally uses primer.",B-
COLOUR POP,MOON LIT,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, plummy purple with warmer undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. It had opaque coverage in a single pass of the applicator. The texture was lightweight, thin, and watery without being runny or too wet, so it dried down fast enough not to settle into lines but still gave some working time. It applied and blended fairly evenly, but it did emphasize my skin‚Äôs texture. This shade wore well for eight hours without fallout.",C+
COLOUR POP,FIRECRACKER,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, rosy copper with warm, orange undertones and a metallic sheen. This shade wasn‚Äôt as sparkly as others, so it had a smoother finish and didn‚Äôt emphasize my skin‚Äôs texture like a lot of the other shades did. It was still pigmented and had enough play time during the dry down to work but not so much time that it didn‚Äôt dry down well. I found it hard to apply evenly, though, even when I used it as an eyeliner. The only way I could make it work was patted over another eyeshadow with my fingertip. As an eyeliner, it lasted for six hours before flaking away in pieces.",D
COLOUR POP,HARD TO EMPRESS,Eyeshadow,"a deep copper with warm, red undertones and flecks of copper sparkle. It had good pigmentation in a single stroke with a watery, thin base that could spread across a larger area without clumping up or becoming terribly patchy. What I did find was that as it dried down, it emphasized the texture of my skin and made it look rougher, though I think in person it‚Äôs not as obvious as in still photos since the light would reflect more in person. It dried down fast enough not to gather in my creases. It lasted for eight hours fairly well, but I did have more noticeable wear near my inner tearduct area.",C-
COLOUR POP,DRAGON,Eyeshadow,"a bright, golden copper with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. It had opaque coverage in a single layer, though as I worked with it and tried to diffuse and spread the product over an area, it seemed to sheer out and was not a buildable product due to how thick the texture appeared after it dried down. It did accentuate the texture of my skin, but it was very reflective and shiny in person that I barely noticed it. I found the formula tricky to work with, especially for covering larger areas by itself or as a base. On its own, it lasted for eight hours with minor fallout but no creasing.",C
COLOUR POP,WALK OF FAME,Eyeshadow,"a medium, coppery brown with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. The consistency was watery and thin, but it yielded nearly opaque coverage in a single pull of product. It diffused decently but had a tendency to make my lid look a lot more textured than it normally did. I could never seem to smooth it out enough that it was actually even, though. When I wore it as an eyeliner, it lasted for eight hours overall but there was some missing after six hours near my inner tearduct.",C-
CHANEL,OR BLANC,Highlighter,"a pale, white gold with subtle, cooler undertones and a luminous sheen. The finish wasn‚Äôt quite metallic but was definitely shiny and noticeable on the skin. It had a smooth, moderately dense texture‚Äìthe type that is firm, doesn‚Äôt kick up excess product, but is still easy to pickup product using a brush, even less dense ones. The powder yielded semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation in one layer but could easily be used with a lighter hand for a sheerer application. On me, it wore well for eight and a half hours before fading noticeably.",A
KAT VON D,METAL CRUSH,Palette,"a new, limited edition trio of powder highlighters. The formula is ‚Äúloaded with hyper-reflective micro-crystals‚Äù (translation: tons of glitter) that can be used ‚Äúon their own, or blend and layer them together.‚Äù They had semi-sheer to semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that yielded a very shiny, metallic, and glittery sheen on the skin. They shifted noticeably swatched, but the shift on my cheeks wasn‚Äôt as noticeable to my eye. There were some sparkles that traveled to parts unknown on my face, which wasn‚Äôt unexpected with just how glittery the shades were. I recommend patting the highlighter on and lightly buffing it toward the end, which helped to shed any loose particles and minimize ‚Äúfallout‚Äù during wear.",B-
JOUER,CITRINE/ROSE QUARTZ/TOPAZ,Palette,"three, miniature-sized powder highlighters. I liked how they each came in their own case, and the compact was large enough for highlighting and blush brushes. Frankly, I think these sizes are more practical for anyone who has more than a handful of highlighters since it takes so long to get through any one highlighter! I do wish the kit itself was priced a bit lower‚Äìlike $30 or $32‚Äìso that the price and value were just more in line with each other.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,INDIAN ROSE,Lipstick,"a soft, medium peachy coral with warm undertones and a cream finish. The color coverage was semi-opaque, while the consistency had moderate slip and felt a bit balm-like as I applied it. The lipstick never tugged or dragged, but the amount of slip made it prone to showing faint ‚Äúlines‚Äù whenever I pressed my lips toether and my edges were less crisp. There was a small amount of product that had settled into my deeper lip lines, though I didn‚Äôt feel like it was noticeable from a normal viewing distance. It wore well for four hours and was moisturizing to wear.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,SABLE SMOKE,Lipstick,"a medium, peachy brown with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had good pigmentation, though it wasn‚Äôt full coverage and never got there. The texture was creamy with moderate slip, which gave it a shinier finish but made it more prone to settling into my lip lines over time. It wore well for four hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,PINK DUSK,Lipstick,"a soft, medium pink with warmer undertones and a natural sheen. It had good color coverage in a single stroke with the coverage being just shy of full. The lipstick was lightly creamy but did not have too much slip, so it adhered well and stayed in place without feeling slippery. It applied evenly, and while there was a bit of color in my deeper lip lines that wasn‚Äôt noticeable in person. This shade lasted for four and a half hours and felt hydrating.",A-
COLOUR POP,TAFFY,Highlighter,"a light-medium, golden peach with warm undertones and a frosted sheen. The texture was looser and a bit drier compared to some of the shades I‚Äôve tried in the same formula. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage with two to three layers. It yielded a strong shine but did not appear overtly shimmery and did not accentuate my skin‚Äôs natural texture. On me, the highlighter stayed on well for eight hours.",B
COLOUR POP,TOUCHE,Highlighter,"a light peach with a sheen that shifted from warmer, yellow peacch to pink. It had good color payoff with a smooth, soft texture that was a touch powdery in the pan, but it applied evenly to bare skin, blended out well, and did not appear dry. The finish was a lot more subtle compared to most of the ColourPop powder highlighters I‚Äôve tried, which some may prefer, but if you are after a more metallic finish, this won‚Äôt be it. It wore well for eight hours on me.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,FLAMINGO,Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque in a single layer, while the lipstick was creamy enough not to drag on the lips but adhered evenly and stayed in place well over time (it did not slide around). There was a faint amount of product that seemed to get into my deeper lip lines that I could see in the close-up photo but not in person. It wore well for five hours and was lightly moisturizing.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,TRUE CORAL,Lipstick,"a bright, medium coral-orange with warm undertones and a cream finish. It was richly pigmented and had a creamy, light-medium thick texture that glided across the lips easily and felt comfortable to wear. There was enough slip, though, that ‚Äúlines‚Äù were visible if I pressed my lips together, and there was a touch of product in my deeper lip lines, though it wasn‚Äôt noticeable in person. The lipstick wore nicely for five hours on me and was hydrating over time.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,CHERRY LUSH,Lipstick,"a medium-dark red with cool undertones and a natural sheen. It had good color coverage, though it wasn‚Äôt quite opaque in a single layer, and was buildable to full coverage with a second pass. The lipstick was lightly creamy, thin without being clingy or prone to separating at my lip lines, and applied evenly. It wore well for almost six hours, left a subtle stain behind, and felt moisturizing to me.",A
COLOUR POP,DUSK TILL DAWN,Palette,"six, full-sized cream eyeshadows. They‚Äôre all quite sparkly/shimmery, and I think that if you aren‚Äôt someone who likes to apply your eyeshadows with fingertips or use glittery eyeshadows patted on top of other eye colors, this set might not be that functional or easy to use. Of the six, one was described specifically as sheer (New Magic), and the rest had semi-opaque to opaque coverage with solid wear, though some of the very glittery shades had a touch of fallout over time‚Äìbarely a blip relative to just how glittery they were.",B+
JOUER,SKINNY DIP/ROSE GOLD/ICE,Palette,"three, miniature-sized powder highlighters. The set will be ideal for someone who is more focused on having a greater variety of shades for their money than physical product, as the set was actually weak on value. The powders were nice and easy to use with a shiny, metallic finish that puts the formula in the strong highlighter category‚Äìthey are not for anyone wanting subtle!‚Äìand fairly consistent with their full-sized versions.",A-
COLOUR POP,RUFFLE MY FEATHERS,Highlighter,"a bright, light white gold with a stronger, white base and ‚Äúcooler‚Äù gold shimmer. The powder had a really smooth consistency that felt almost wet to the touch, which meant it was denser and didn‚Äôt have any powderiness in the pan (nor on the skin) but needed a moderately dense brush for best application and higher coverage. It had opaque pigmentation that could easily be adjusted to sheerer coverage by blending it out or by using a lighter touch. The highlighter wore nicely on my skin for eight and a half hours before I saw some signs of fading.",A
NARS,WANTED,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette available exclusively at Sephora and NARS. The palette launches officially on 11/29 on NARS and 12/4 on Sephora but will be available for one-day early access on 11/27 at Sephora. Per the brand, the palette features an ‚Äúall-new pure pigment formula [that] delivers the richest, most intense color payoff in just one stroke.‚Äù Worth noting was that there were several more sparkly, metallic shades, which would be best used with fingertips, over a lightly tacky base, or with a dampened brush rather than dry as they had some fallout and did not have ‚Äúone stroke‚Äù pigmentation.",B-
MAC,"OH, HOLY EYES",Palette,"a new, limited edition palette that featurings warm-toned neutrals across four mattes and two shimmers. Worth noting, while it appears to be a good size, the weight of the palette is a mere 0.10 oz. or the equivalent of two full-sized eyeshadows but substantially less product than a typical MAC quad (0.19 oz.). The colors worked well together, but the two shimmers were less impressive.",B
MAC,SILENT NIGHT,Lipgloss,"a medium, plummy-purple tinted base with flecks of blue and violet sparkle and micro-glitter. It had a medium-level of sparkle and medium coverage from the base. For this type of shade, it applied fairly evenly with only minimal product getting into my lip lines, which was camouflaged by the sparkle and shine of the finish. The consistency was light-medium in thickness, tacky but fairly spreadable. It wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A-
MAC,TWERK FOR GIFTS,Lipgloss,"a medium, golden peach with warm undertones and multi-colored micro-sparkle and finer, gold pearl. It had semi-sheer color coverage that applied without streaking, but it did pull into my lip lines noticeably. The shiny finish coupled with the shimmer helped distract from the settling but not entirely. The gloss had a smooth, spreadable consistency that was light-medium in thickness (which helped it feel smooth on my lips, even when I pressed my lips together) but was moderately tacky. It stayed on nicely for four and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.",B
MAC,BABY IT'S GOLD OUTSIDE,Highlighter,"a light-medium, rosy brown base with flecks of gold sparkle but had more of a natural finish overall. The consistency was smooth to the touch without kicking up excess product, and it didn’t seem to stiff to work with, but it was more semi-sheer in coverage, which I was able to build up to semi-opaque coverage with three layers. It felt drier compared to most of the brand’s other Mineralize Skinfinishes in recent memory.

The powder buffed and blended nicely onto my skin without emphasizing my texture. The sparkles did not seem particularly present on my skin after I finished blending everything together, though (some may prefer that!). It wore well for eight hours on me before fading noticeably. As a note: the powder is double the size of a typical Mineralize Skinfinish, so the higher price tag makes sense, but I don’t think many were clamoring for a jumbo-sized Mineralize Skinfinish either.",B-
COLOUR POP,YOU HAD ME AT HELLO,Palette,"a slightly muted, warm-toned neutral palette with a mix of gold, copper, brown, and berry. If your stash happens to be missing these types of shades and you’ve been looking for them, this is not a bad way to get your fill. Only one of the 12 shades was a bit of a miss (Candygram), which could be improved by using it over a tacky base or using a fingertip or a dampened brush to apply.
",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,WILD GINGER,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark orange-red with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had good pigmentation in a single layer that was nearly opaque in coverage. The texture was smooth, lightly creamy, and comfortable to apply and to wear as it glided on without tugging. It could have been more smoothing and flattering, as there was noticeable color in my lip lines in the close-up photo but wasn’t as noticeable in person due to the shine of the finish and brightness of the color. It wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating.
",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,SCARLET ROUGE,Lipstick,"a medium red with warm undertones and a satin sheen. The color payoff was nearly opaque in a single stroke, but my lip freckle peeked through. The consistency was lightweight, creamy without being too slippery or thick, and easy to control for more precise application without a lip brush. It stayed on well for five and a half hours, left a slight stain behind, and was moisturizing while worn.
",A-
COLOUR POP,IN IT TO WIN IT,Bronzer,"a muted, medium-dark brown with warm, yellow undertones and a barely-there golden sheen. It had good pigmentation, but the texture was drier and wasn’t as finely-milled as I would have expected. I felt like it took a bit longer to diffuse and blend out the bronzer evenly on my skin. Once on, the result was nice–natural but not overtly shimmery–with noticeable warmth. It stayed on well for eight hours before fading.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,VIOLET FATALE,Lipstick,"a deep fuchsia with cool undertones and a soft sheen. It had semi-opaque color payoff in a single layer, which was slightly buildable, but it never achieved full coverage as the texture was thin and had moderate slip. It didn‚Äôt feel slippery when worn, though. This shade lasted for five hours on me, left a stain behind, and was moisturizing while worn.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,BRUISED PLUM,Lipstick,"a deep plum with subtle, cool undertones and a fine, pearl finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered the lips somewhat evenly, and some of the color slipped into my lip lines. It applied better than many other shades with this amount of slip and deepness in color, but it still had plenty of room for improvement. It wore well for five and a half hours, left a slight stain behind, and was hydrating.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,EXOTICA,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, raspberry pink with cooler undertones and a soft sheen. It had good color coverage in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage. The lipstick was lightly creamy with some slip, but it didn‚Äôt feel thick or heavy, and it did not slide around while worn. It wore well for five hours, left a subtle stain behind, and was moisturizing while worn.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,ELECTRIQUE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a luminous finish. The lipstick felt thinner with moderate slip, but it seemed to get a bit tacky as I applied it, so it adhered better than I would have expected. It was easy to apply, as it did not tug, and it applied evenly. It had good pigmentation, though it wasn‚Äôt opaque, that stayed on well for five hours and was hydrating.",A-
COLOUR POP,CA DREAMING,Bronzer,"a medium, golden brown with warm, yellow undertones and a matte finish. It had excellent pigmentation that applied evenly to bare skin and blended out nicely. The texture was soft, a smidgen on the powdery side, but it did not appear dry or powdery on the skin and seemed to melt on the skin as I buffed it on. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.",A-
TARTE,TOASTED,Palette,"12 shades of warm neutrals with a mix of mattes and metallics. I wish there was more variety in the shimmery shades‚Äìthree are variations on medium copper!‚Äìand that the gold shade was more finely-milled and had a firmer press. The eyeshadows performed decently, but the powderiness of the mattes made them the type of texture that needed a primer to do well.",B
GIORGIO ARMANI,HOLIDAY 2017,Palette,"four miniature-sized Lip Maestros. This was another set that was devoured by the end of Sephora‚Äôs recent sale! I already had everything ready to go, and luckily, all the shades in the kit are available individually, so hopefully, the reviews can be of some help for anyone looking for specific shades rather than the set (and I‚Äôve definitely made mental notes to cover the high-end lip sets earlier next year). The Lip Maestro formula is supposed to have a ‚Äúluminous matte‚Äù finish with ‚Äú8 hours of wear‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh pigment.‚Äù All those things are pretty much on the nose‚Äìthe finish has a noticeable sheen for the first few hours and eventually gets down to a mostly matte finish, and they are very pigmented and typically wear between six and eight hours on me. Most of the shades leave stains behind, but some of the very light ones don‚Äôt seem to stain.",A
KAT VON D,HILDA,Lipstick,"a dark brown with subtle, warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. The consistency was creamy, a little thicker than other shades, and it applied easily and evenly with intense, opaque coverage in one stroke. I loved the way it felt and applied, but the dry down didn‚Äôt appear as forgiving on the lips and looked a bit dry and ‚Äúcracked‚Äù when I smiled. It wore well for seven and a half hours and was lightly drying after five hours of wear.",A-
KAT VON D,JULIA,Lipstick,"a medium, pink-coral with warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. It had good color coverage, though it wasn‚Äôt opaque in one layer. The texture was thinner and felt a bit watery compared to the other shades in the formula, and it did not apply as well either‚Äìthere were slight streaks (even after it dried down) and wasn‚Äôt as easy to control overall. It lasted for seven hours and started to feel drying to me after five hours of wear.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,SATIN CHIC,Lipstick,"a light peach with warm, orange undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a very creamy consistency that felt slippery on the lips (during wear) and was hard to control during application. It had noticeable streaks and pulled into my lip lines from the get-go and worsened over the next two and a half hours. It was hydrating while worn, though.",C+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,DEVORE,Lipstick,"a light-medium brown with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. The lipstick had a creamy, emollient feel going on the lips, so it was very comfortable and definitely felt hydrating while I wore it, but it also felt slippery and only lasted for two and a half hours on me before wearing away. It had semi-opaque color payoff that went on evenly and only settled slightly into my deeper lip lines, which was surprising, given the amount of slip in the texture.",B-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,AUTOEROTIQUE,Lipstick,"a medium peach with warm, brownish undertones and a cream finish. The color payoff was very nearly opaque in a single layer, while the texture was smooth, creamy, and had moderate slip. There was subtle streakiness along the edges of my lips, but it wasn‚Äôt noticeable in person‚Äìthe same was true of the minute amount of color that gathered in my lip lines. This shade stayed on well for three and a half hours on me but was hydrating.",B+
KAT VON D,BRUNO,Lipstick,"a vibrant, deep cobalt blue with cool undertones and a fine, metallic shimmer strewn throughout the lipstick. It had opaque color coverage in one layer. The consistency was smooth, thin without being watery, and it dried down quickly but gave me enough time to maneuver along the edges and go back to spread out the product in places. It dried down comfortably and did not feel clingy nor did it emphasize the texture of my lips. On me, the color stayed on well for nine hours and was slightly drying after six hours of wear.",A
KAT VON D,THUMBELINA,Lipstick,"a medium-dark red with subtle, warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. I was surprised it wasn‚Äôt full coverage in a single layer, as most reds are quite pigmented, but it needed a second layer for full opacity. The texture was lightweight, fluid and thin without being watery, which helped it spread evenly and easily across the lips without spilling past the lip line too readily. The color wore well for over eight hours but started to feel drying after six hours of wear.",A-
TOO FACED,WHITE CHOCOLATE BAR,Palette,"a new, limited edition eyeshadow palette that is available for Rouge/VIB members from 11/21 to 11/22 and then releases for everyone on at 11/23. It‚Äôs one of Too Faced‚Äôs worst palettes, and it‚Äôs still a mediocre, not-worth-$5 palette used over their own primer. The formula used in this palette is so dry that shades are often dusty, chalky, or powdery (or some mix) with many shades applying with little pigmentation, sheering out as soon as they‚Äôre touched, and have little wear time (even over primer!).",F
COLOUR POP,BOY NEXT DOOR,Highlighter,"a light-medium gold with warm, orange undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. It had good pigmentation, but the texture was incredibly soft and loosely pressed, which resulted in a lot of product coming away from the pan at once with a tendency to clump up as it was still a creamier, thicker powder.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,MAGNETIC ATTRACTION,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark brown with subtle, warm undertones and a glossy finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly across the lips. With the lightly glossy finish, it appeared translucent and more like a lip stain than a lipstick on the lips. The texture was smooth, lightly creamy, and thin with moderate slip. I was surprised that it didn‚Äôt pull heavily into my lip lines. It wore well for four and a half hours and was hydrating over time.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,PAPER DOLL,Lipstick,"a light-medium pink with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had good pigmentation that applied evenly across the lips, but the color pulled into my lip lines, especially over the three and a half hours it lasted for. The texture was creamy with noticeable slip, so while it was comfortable to apply and to wear, it did not last long.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,NIGHT MAUVE,Lipstick,"a medium, reddish plum with warm undertones and a cream finish. The consistency was quite slippery, which resulted in color that moved on the lips but also color that settled into my lip lines right away and only worsened over time. The pigmentation was nearly opaque in a single stroke, at least! It wore well for four hours and felt moisturizing to me.",B
BECCA COSMETICS,GOLDEN MINT,Highlighter,"a very light green with soft, warm undertones and a subtle, green-to-gold shifting pearl finish. It had opaque pigmentation with a soft, smooth consistency that applied evenly to skin and blended out easily. The consistency was soft, silky, and lightly creamy, and the powder sat nicely on the skin and did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me.",A
PAT MCGRATH,ATTITUDE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark brown with warm, rosy undertones and a cream finish. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, creamy texture that was a bit emollient compared to the average shade in the formula. I didn‚Äôt have any issues applying it, though, and the color still adhered well to the lips for long-wear (six hours). The formula felt hydrating over time.",A
PAT MCGRATH,BEAUTY JUNKIE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, while the texture felt velvety and just barely creamy‚Äìit felt more like a hybrid between the LuxeTrance and MatteTrance formulas to me. The color applied evenly and lasted for seven hours on me, but there was a smidgen of color that settled into my deeper lip lines over time. I found the lipstick was moisturizing while I wore it.",A
PAT MCGRATH,WRECKED,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark berry with subtle, cool undertones and a natural sheen. It had good color payoff in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with half of a layer more. The texture was lightweight, thin but not too thin, and just creamy enough to slide across the lips without dragging. The color adhered evenly and stayed on well for over seven hours but felt comfortable and lightly hydrating while worn.",A
COLOUR POP,SEMI PRECIOUS,Palette," eight, metallic eyeshadows housed in a cardboard palette. They‚Äôre larger than the typical ColourPop eyeshadow, and they felt slightly creamier and smoother with moderate density but were never heavy or too thick. Only one of the eight shades could have been better, but even that, it was still a good eyeshadow. As long as you‚Äôre someone who adores shimmers or doesn‚Äôt mind pulling in other finishes to complement this palette, it‚Äôs well worth considering.",A
SURRATT BEAUTY,FAUX PAS,Lipgloss,"a yellow-tinted translucent base with fine iridescent and gold sparkle. It had sheer coverage, which was anticipated to a degree‚Äìit was marketed as a ‚Äúsheer, non-sticky gloss that builds intensity with each coat‚Äù‚Äìbut it was sheer and only had had semi-sheer ‚Äúcoverage‚Äù in the form of shimmer. It did not build up, and it was nowhere near non-sticky. The texture was smooth, light-medium in thickness, and quite tacky, which did help it last for four hours on me, despite being rather sheer.",B
SURRATT BEAUTY,JE NE SAIS QUOI,Lipgloss,"a light, pinky lavender with fine violet, gold, and iridescent sparkle. This was an interesting shade, as the base stained my lips a deeper fuchsia within a few minutes (even the applicator appeared stained!), but that‚Äôs not something advertised as part of the formula. The texture was smooth, tacky, and somewhat spreadable but thick and tacky enough that it took a bit of maneuvering to get even coverage. It had sheer coverage that was buildable to semi-sheer coverage that lasted for five hours on me and was hydrating over time.",A-
SURRATT BEAUTY,OH LA LA,Lipgloss,"a milky peach base with iridescent and gold flecks of sparkle. It had sheer coverage, which wasn‚Äôt buildable, and only a smattering of sparkle‚Äìit added slight warmth and lightened my natural lip color just a bit. The texture was tacky and harder to spread, but it was comfortable to wear over time. It wore well for four hours and was moisturizing.",B
SURRATT BEAUTY,VOILA,Lipgloss,"a pale, transcluent gold base with flecks of iridescent and gold sparkle. The gloss lightened my natural lip color slightly without making it appear warmer or cooler. It had semi-sheer ‚Äúcoverage‚Äù in the form of shimmer, but it did not appear that sparkly in person‚Äìmore of a shiny product than shimmery. The texture was sticky, medium in weight, and took a little more effort to spread across the lips. It lasted for four hours and was hydrating.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,DRESSED TO KILL,Lipstick,"a bright, medium red with subtle, warm undertones and a natural sheen. The consistency was smooth, almost silky, and thin without being too thin, which gave it a more natural appearance on the lips‚Äìalmost like a lip stain‚Äìwhen paired with the soft sheen it had. The pigmentation was nearly opaque and lasted for five hours. It felt lightly hydrating overall.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,ORIGINAL SIN,Lipstick,"a medium red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a cream finish. The lipstick was smooth, lightly creamy without being too slippery on the lips during wear. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that covered the lips evenly and smoothly without dragging. There was a smidgen of color in my deeper lip lines, but I couldn‚Äôt tell at all in person. It stayed on well for five hours and was hydrating while worn.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,DANGEROUS BEAUTY,Lipstick,"a bright, medium plum with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. The color payoff was good‚Äìjust a smidgen of my lip freckle peeked through‚Äìwith a smooth, lightly creamy consistency that was easy to apply and control on the lips for even coverage. It wore well for five hours and was moisturizing over time.",A
GIVENCHY,HOLIDAY 2017,Palette,"two, miniature-sized Le Rouge lipsticks in shades that can be purchased individually from the permanent line-up. It was available earlier this week, but the recent sale seems to have decimated stock on the lip sets this holiday season‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure if this particular set is available in stores or not, but both shades can be purchased on their own. As far as mini lipsticks go, these felt particularly cheap and lightweight with a very short bullet, and I felt like they had more slip and less pigmented compared to their full-sized versions.",B+
HUDA BEAUTY,SMOKEY,Palette,"nine shades of neutral, mostly warm-toned eyeshadows with a mix of matte and shimmer finishes. The majority of the shades were quite good, and I found the palette easy to use. The eyeshadows were semi-opaque to opaque, blendable, and long-wearing overall. It also leaned less warm-toned than most palettes these days, so that was nice to see, too!",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,TRUE CORAL,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a creamy, shiny finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly across the lips. The lip color felt more watery when I initially applied it, but it developed into a more gel-like, lightly tacky texture that was very smoothing and comfortable to wear. The color was still going strong after eight hours, while the shine had lasted a solid six hours on me. The formula was hydrating while worn.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,CHERRY LUSH,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium pinky red with cool, blue undertones and a jelly-like finish. It had good color coverage, but there was still translucency so my lip freckle came through slightly. The consistency was lightweight, smooth, and easy to apply as it felt watery initially and became more gel-like within a few minutes. The color was still going strong after eight hours of wear (with no feathering), while the formula was moisturizing over time.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,CASABLANCA,Lipgloss,"a deep red with subtle warm undertones and fine pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied without streaking, though there was slight color that had pulled into my lip lines, which wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The texture smooth, watery, and easy to spread initially but developed a light tackiness and more of a gel-like feel after a minute or two.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,EXOTICA,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark raspberry pink with cool undertones and barely-there pearl. It had good color coverage, but it wasn‚Äôt opaque. The consistency was lightweight, smooth, and lightly tacky after it ‚Äúset‚Äù from its initial watery feel. It was comfortable to wear, hydrating, and long-wearing with the color still going strong after eight hours of wear.",A
CIATE,IN TOO DEEP,Blush,"a medium, pinky mauve with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It had semi-sheer, buildable pigmentation (up to semi-opaque) that applied evenly to bare skin. The powder was smooth to the touch without being too dense (or stiff) nor was it so soft that it felt powdery. It was easy to diffuse the edges on the cheeks, and the more I blended the powder, the more refined and smooth the glow looked. This shade would be more ideal for lighter complexions, as it just barely showed up on my skin tone with a heavier application. It wore well for eight hours on before fading.",A-
PAT MCGRATH,DONATELLA,Lipstick,"a medium, rosy beige with soft, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had rich color payoff in a single stroke, which delivered even, smooth coverage across the lips. There was slight settling along the center of my bottom lip, but it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance (which is where it matters most!). The texture was smooth, velvety, and comfortable to wear with just enough slip to glide on with ease but not enough for the color to slide around while worn. This shade wore well for five hours and was hydrating while worn‚Äìfairly impressive for this type of color.",A
PAT MCGRATH,REALNESS,Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with warmer undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, and the lipstick applied evenly and smoothly directly from the tube. It never showed ‚Äúlines‚Äù when I pressed my lips despite being creamy enough to skate across the lips easily. The texture felt smooth, lightweight, and ‚Äúclung‚Äù to lips for excellent wear time but never in a drying way, as the formula was moderately moisturizing over the five and a half hours it lasted for.",A+
PAT MCGRATH,VALETTA,Lipstick,"a light-medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had good color payoff that covered the lips fairly well, but this shade seemed to pull away more at my lip lines and had very slight streaking along the edges of my lips. I don‚Äôt think either of those flaws were too noticeable in person. I also found that it applied and appeared lighter on my lips than initially swatched on my arm (whereas most of the shades in the line are similar swatched on the skin and on lips, often going slightly darker on the lips). The consistency was creamy and had more slip than most of the LuxeTrance shades I‚Äôve tried. It was comfortable to wear, lasted for four and a half hours, and was hydrating over time.",B+
HUDA BEAUTY,ELECTRIC,Palette,"a bright mix of colors in a compact, perfect-for-traveling nine-pan palette that saves on space but doesn‚Äôt skimp on quality or even quantity. The eyeshadows are just shy of most full-sized eyeshadows (0.039 oz. vs. 0.05 oz.), and the palette itself is the size of typical eyeshadow quads. Per the brand, the formula is supposed to be ‚Äúhighly pigmented‚Äù with a ‚Äúsmooth and blendable texture.‚Äù",A-
PAT MCGRATH,SHE'S HEAVEN,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark brown with subtle, warm rosy undertones and a cream finish. The color payoff was incredibly rich with opaque coverage in a single layer (frankly, less than a layer would have been opaque!). The consistency was smooth, velvety, and was just creamy enough not to tug on the lips when applied directly from the tube. It seemed to make my lips appear a little smoother overall. This shade wore well for six hours and felt hydrating on.",A+
PAT MCGRATH,PROFUMO,Lipstick,"a medium pink with soft, warm undertones and a cream finish. The pigmentation was fantastic, and the color applied evenly and smoothly across the lips, but the added slip to this particular shade made‚Äìmarginally so!‚Äìless flattering on the lips compared to other shades, as there was slight settling into my deeper lip lines. It was easy to apply, never tugged, and it still adhered well to the lips and yielded six and a half hour wear that was moisturizing over time.",A-
PAT MCGRATH,APRICULT,Lipstick,"Pat McGrath Apricult LuxeTrance Lipstick ($38.00 for 0.14 oz.) is a bright, medium-dark coral-orange with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. The texture was denser and a little thicker compared to most in the LuxeTrance formula; it felt a little more velvety like the MatteTrance formula does. It was still comfortable to wear and easy to apply, but it felt stiffer initially as I pulled it across my lips. It had opaque pigmentation that lasted well for seven hours on me and was lightly hydrating. There was just a smidgen of color that pulled into my deeper lip lines that wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,ADORA,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark plum with subtle, warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that covered the lips with beautifully even, smooth coverage that sat exceptionally well on the lips. I felt like the finish of this made my lips appear plumper and smoother. The texture was lightweight, lightly creamy without being too slippery, and comfortable to wear. It wore well for four and half hours and was moisturizing while worn.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,CONTEMPT,Lipstick,"a brighter, medium orange with warm undertones and an ultra-fine, golden pearl, which gave it a more luminous finish. The lipstick felt creamy with moderate slip, so it did not feel or look heavy on the lips but applied without tugging. It had good color payoff, which was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. I noticed that the formula smoothed out my lip lines quite a bit. This shade stayed on well for four and a half hours and felt hydrating to me.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,VERMILLIONAIRE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange with warm, red undertones and a cream finish. The lipstick was intensely pigmented with a smooth, creamy texture that didn‚Äôt drag or tug on the lips, but it still adhered well so the product did not slide around over time. It lasted for five hours and was lightly hydrating while worn.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,BITTEN BERRY,Lipstick,"a subtle, dark plum with cooler undertones and a glossy, high-shine finish. It had sheer to semi-sheer coverage, as described, with a smooth, almost cream-like texture that was lightweight, non-tacky, and very comfortable to wear, though it took me a couple of uses to realize I did not need to apply much to get even coverage. There was slight color that filled my lip lines, but I did not notice it from a normal viewing distance. The color lasted for four hours and was nicely moisturizing.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,SPIKED CHERRY,Lipstick,"a brighter, medium-dark raspberry pink with cool, blue undertones and a mirror-like shine. It had semi-sheer to medium coverage‚Äìmore than a bit of a tint but still had visible translucency‚Äìthat covered the lips evenly with a smidgen of color settling into my deeper lip lines, though it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The texture was smooth, lightweight, non-sticky, and comfortable to wear, though it felt a bit slippery. It wore well for four hours, though the stain lingered for a bit longer (maybe an hour or so) and was very hydrating.",A-
NATASHA DENONA,BRONZE,Eyeshadow,"a medium, coppery brown with warm, orange undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. It had good pigmentation in a single layer when applied with a fingertip (which was how the brand advised for ‚Äúintense payoff,‚Äù whereas a brush would yield a ‚Äúmore sheer effect.‚Äù The texture was dense, and while I could feel some of the cream-powder hybrid qualities of the formula, it felt more like a dried down cream eyeshadow. There needed to be more slip in the formula to help improve application and blendability, as it took a little more effort to even out the color and diffuse the edges. It lasted for eight hours before it started to crease with light fallout.",B-
NATASHA DENONA,GREY-BROWN,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, taupe-brown with soft, warm undertones and a sparkling finish. It had opaque color coverage when applied with a fingertip to the lid. The texture was quite dense, but this shade had more slip compared to the other three shades released, so it was a bit easier to work with for initial application and blending out for even coverage. It wore well for eight hours before starting to crease on me and had slight fallout over time.",B
NATASHA DENONA,NUDE,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium, golden orange with warm undertones and a sparkling sheen. It had excellent pigmentation that applied somewhat evenly to bare skin, but it was a struggle to really diffuse and soften the edges regardless of whether I was using fingertips or brushes or if layered over a primer. The effect was certainly sparkling and pretty but wish the formula had more slip and blendability to be a more versatile product. It stayed on well for eight hours before creasing faintly, while there was slight fallout over time.",B-
NATASHA DENONA,PEACH,Eyeshadow,"a medium orange with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic shine. It had rich pigmentation in a single layer when applied with fingertips and sheerer coverage when used with a brush, which was as described by the brand. The texture was quite dense and felt a little dry as it was harder to blend out the edges with using a fair amount of pressure to do so, which wasn‚Äôt comfortable on the lid. The eyeshadow lasted for eight hours before creasing and had some fallout during wear.",B-
BITE BEAUTY,MAUVEMBER 2017,Lipstick,"a medium, rosy mauve with cool undertones and a glossy, cream finish. It was richly pigmented in a single layer, and the liquid lipstick applied evenly and smoothly across the lips and did not emphasize the natural texture on my lips. The formula was lightweight, comfortable to wear, and long-wearing (five and a half hours of wear!) that felt hydrating over time.",A+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,PRETTY PERSUASIVE,Lipstick,"a medium pink with soft, warm undertones and a cream finish. The color payoff was nearly opaque, while the texture was moderately creamy with light slip. It applied evenly across the lips without streaking, but there was just the smallest amount of color that seemed to sit in my deeper lip lines. I didn‚Äôt find that noticeable in person, though, just in the close-up photos. This shade wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,SUGAR GLIDER,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark mauve with subtle, warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly across the lips. The consistency was moderately emollient and felt more gel-like than creamy, and the lipstick itself seemed thinner and clung more than other shades (though it did not feel clingy or drying!). On me, the color lasted for four hours and was lightly moisturizing.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,SWEET TEMPEST,Lipstick,"a bright, coral-red with warmer undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque color coverage in a single layer. The lipstick was lightly creamy with moderate slip, which made for an easy, glide-on application and a more noticeable shininess in the finish. The coverage could have been better, but the finish of this seemed to smooth out my lip lines a bit. It wore well for four and a half hours and was hydrating over time.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,JASMIN ROUGE,Lipstick,"a rich, medium pink-red with cooler undertones and a luminous sheen. It had good color coverage in a single layer, though it wasn‚Äôt full coverage and was not buildable to opaque coverage either. The texture was smooth, moderately emollient, and just a touch tacky after a few minutes (but I think this helped it stay on longer!). What was most impressive about the shade was its ability to smooth out the texture of my lips and not sit in my lip lines. This shade lasted for five hours and was moisturizing.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,NAKED AMBITION,Lipstick,"a slightly muted, light-medium peach with warmer undertones and a cream finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque, but it did not apply evenly and had a lot of slip, so the product gathered in my lip lines noticeably. There was just so much slickness when I went to apply it that I felt like it was harder to control the application and imposible to avoid streakiness. The color stayed on well for three and a half hours with pretty significant settling over time, too.",C-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,PLAYGIRL,Lipstick,"a rich, medium magenta pink with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had good color payoff in a single layer, though it was not opaque. The consistency was smooth, lightly creamy, and had moderate slip‚Äìit felt more like a gel-cream hybrid as a result. The lipstick applied evenly, but there was slight color that had gathered in my deeper lip lines, though the glossy finish and brighter color made this difficult to detect from a normal viewing distance. It wore well for four and a half hours, left a subtle stain behind, and was lightly hydrating.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,DISCRETION,Lipstick,"a dark plum with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. It had rich color payoff with a creamy, moderately emollient texture that helped my lips appear smoother and fuller. It applied evenly and never dragged when I applied it directly to my lips. The color wore well for five hours and was hydrating while worn.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,EROGENOUS,Lipstick,"a medium peach with warm, yellow undertones and a cream finish. It had good pigmentation, though it wasn‚Äôt opaque, that applied fairly evenly across the lips. The consistency was creamy with a lot of slip, which was where I think the application went a little awry‚Äìthere was a faint amount of color that sat in my deeper lip lines, and the lipstick just didn‚Äôt adhere was well as other shades have in the past. It stayed on well for four hours and was somewhat moisturizing.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,FOXFIRE,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark orange-red with warm undertones and a cream finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque‚Äìyou could see my lip freckle peeking through slightly‚Äìthat covered the lips with smooth, even coverage. The lipstick was creamy with some slip, and while I didn‚Äôt have any issues with streakiness, I did notice some color gather in my lip lines initially, though it did not worsen over time and wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance. This shade wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating.",A-
NARS,ORGASM/ORGASM,Palette,"the brand‚Äôs ever-popular Orgasm blush and its more recently released Orgams lipstick. I had initially skipped this duo, as I‚Äôve reviewed the blush umpteen amount of times, and the lipstick was just released, but then I noticed on Sephora it said ‚ÄúMini Audacious Lipstick in Orgasm,‚Äù and I nearly jumped for joy‚Ä¶ but it was a lie‚Äìit‚Äôs just the regular lipstick. If you‚Äôre a fan of the golden-shimmered pink that is Orgasm, the duo might be right up your alley!",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,DECEIVER,Lipstick,"a medium peach with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied without streakiness but the amount of slip in the lipstick resulted in the color gathering and separating around and in my lip lines. It just did not look that good applied‚Äìit was a texture that was crying out for a lip liner or primer underneath. It also had a lot more slip than I would have expected, which led to a shorter wear time of three and a half hours, though it was hydrating.",C+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,UNIVERSAL APPEAL,Lipstick,"a muted, medium mauve with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage in a single layer. The lipstick was lightly creamy with enough slip not to tug on the lips when applied but not enough that it felt slippery and moved around a lot during wear. It stayed on well for five hours and felt lightly moisturizing while worn.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,WICKED WAYS,Lipstick,"a muted, deep plummy brown with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips without dragging. The texture was lightweight, velvety, and creamy enough to be comfortable to wear but never felt slippery while worn. It lasted for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A
MAC,FLORESCENCE,Lipgloss,"a bright, golden yellow with fine, gold pearl. This one didn‚Äôt seem holographic to me‚Äìmetallic and high-shine, yes‚Äìand was one of those lip products that looks really pretty in the tube and swatched but did not translate well on the lips. It had medium coverage, so the natural lip color came through and muted the brightness of the color and gave it an almost greenish cast. It applied unevely and pulled into every single lip line I had. The texture felt smooth but developed a lot of tackiness and felt a little gluey on. The tingling sensation was present for 25 minutes, and the gloss itself lasted for four hours on me but was neither drying nor hydrating.",C
MAC,TWINKLE TWINK,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium orange with warm undertones and lighter orange and peach pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied somewhat evenly, but the gloss settled into my lip lines, though the shiny finish made it less noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The gloss was medium in weight with a fair amount of tackiness, so it may not be for everyone just from a texture standpoint. It wore well for four and a half hours and was non-drying. The tingling sensation was noticeable for 25 minutes.",B
MAC,GILDED AGE,Lipgloss,"a rich, coppery brown with warm, red undertones and lighter gold, copper, and bronze pearl. It had a high-shine, metallic finish that appeared lighter and darker as the light reflected off the shimmer, but it didn‚Äôt see holographic to my eye. The consistency was smooth and easy to spread across the lips, and it didn‚Äôt seem to emphasize my lip lines like some of the other shades have in this formula. It had opaque coverage that wore well for five hours and was neither drying nor hydrating. The tingling sensation was noticeable for 20 minutes.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,AGE OF CONSENT,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good color coverage in a single layer‚Äìjust shy of truly opaque‚Äìthat applied evenly on the lips. The consistency was smooth, velvety, and felt more emollient (but not really creamy) when I wore it on my lips, so there was a bit of color that seemed to get into my lip lines over time. It wore well for four and a half hours and felt lightly hydrating.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,BEST REVENGE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium red with neutral undertones and a semi-matte finish. The lipstick was richly pigmented, and the color applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. It had a lightly creamy consistency, which made application easy to deal with, but it did not feel too slippery when worn, so I had no issues with the color feathering over time. On me, it lasted for five and a half hours, left a stain behind, and was lightly moisturizing.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,NIGHT PORTER,Lipstick,"a medium-dark red with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had good color coverage in a single stroke, though there was a subtle layer of translucency as my lip freckle peeked through (looked more like a faint shadow). The consistency felt smooth with light slip‚Äìmore velvety than creamy‚Äìand was comfortable to apply and to wear. This shade stayed on well for almost six hours and was lightly hydrating.",A
MAC,BROKEN HALO,Lipgloss,"a silvery, lavender with cooler undertones and fine pink, lavender, and gold pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied somewhat evenly, but I could tell in the close-up that it applied more heavily in some places than others, though the settling was only minor (and not a surprise given the lightness of the color). The texture felt smooth going on, developed to a moderately tacky consistency, and had a minty, tingling sensation for 25 minutes. It wore well for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B
MAC,SENSORY OVERLOAD,Lipgloss,"a dark, bluish gray with cool pink, lavender, and teal pearl. It had good pigmentation, though it was not quite opaque, and appeared pinker and purpler on the lips than swatched, which was likely partially due to the natural pink tones of my lips coming through along with a lot of the pink pearl as I could see this one shifting to teal and pink as I moved. The consistency was medium in thickness, quite tacky, and smooth. The tingling sensation was apparent for 25 minutes, while the gloss itself lasted for five hours on me.",B+
MAC,"PEACE, LOVE, UNITY, RESPECT",Lipgloss,"a medium-dark, olive green base with lighter, emerald green pearl. It had semi-sheer coverage with a moderate of shimmer, but it applied unevenly and a lot of the shimmer pulled into my lip lines, too. The texture had a moderate amount of tackiness but did not feel thick on the lips. The tingling sensation lasted for around 20 minutes on me for this shade. It gloss stayed on for four hours on me and felt neither drying nor hydrating over time.",D+
COLOURED RAINE,BERRY CUTE,Palette,"six eyeshadows with a mix of mattes and shimmers. I‚Äôve been a fan of Coloured Raine‚Äôs eyeshadows in the past, but I wasn‚Äôt as enamored with the formula they have here, or perhaps, it is the pairing of thinner, more powdery mattes with very dense, almost cream-like shimmers that just don‚Äôt combine that well. I struggled to use to get the shades to come together decently‚Äìnormally with enough effort and finagling, I can get to decent but not with this one.",B-
NARS,HOT SAND/RITA,Palette,"a peachy highlighter and a vibrant, warm red lipstick. The highlighter actually seemed better than I remember the full-sized version being, while the lipstick was consistent with the full-sized version.",A
COLOUR POP,HIDDEN AGENDA,Palette,"a deep, muted plum, warm brown, and dark, warm plum. All three shades were very pigmented and long-wearing, while Reign had a different texture compared to most of the Ultra Satins I‚Äôve tried in the past that wasn‚Äôt as comfortable to wear and did not look as flattering on the lips compared to the other two shades.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,LAVENDER LURE,Palette,"a new, limited edition highlighting and blush duo that includes a light, warm pink and a medium, warm pink. According to the brand, the blush ‚Äúcan be applied wet for a soft veil of color‚Äù or ‚Äúdry for a sweeping pop of vibrancy.‚Äù I don‚Äôt find that to be a useful or accurate description‚Äìthe product is quite pigmented dry and only more pigmented when used with a dampened brush, and the more shimmery shade becomes more metallic if used wet. As long as you don‚Äôt mind more pigmentation out of the duo, you‚Äôll be in a good shape, but if you were looking for sheerer coverage (as the formula name itself might suggest!), you‚Äôll be out of luck.",B
MAC,WARM,Palette,"a shimmery gold, neutral red, and cool red. Only one shade is truly warm-toned, while one is extremely cool-toned, so I‚Äôm not sure why this is the ‚Äúwarm‚Äù kit. The shades themselves are pretty, and MAC always knows how to create a beautiful red, so it‚Äôs not a surprise that the two in the set did well. The shimmery gold will work for layering or for someone who likes some sheerness in their lipsticks but will disappoint anyone looking for good opacity.",B+
CHANEL,BURNT CORAL (390),Blush,"a dark copper with warm, red undertones and faint gold and copper pearl. The consistency was moderately dusty, and I did not expect much out of it as a result, but it was an instance where the application was a lot better in practice. It had medium, buildable pigmentation that applied evenly to bare skin, blended out with minimal effort, and lasted for a solid eight hours.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,ORCHID SOLEIL,Lipstick,"a soft, medium rosy copper with warm undertones and fine, gold, copper, and pink pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a smooth, lightweight texture that was creamy enough to glide on easily but did not settle much into my lip lines. The finish was shiny and metallic but never felt clingy or became drying over time. The lipstick stayed on well for four and a half hours and was very hydrating while worn.",A-
MAC,PERSIMMON,Lipstick,"a bright, medium coral-orange with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a very creamy consistency that had moderate slip and did not adhere as well to the lips as some of the other Mattenes in the collection; you could see a bit of color settling in my lip lines from the beginning. The lipstick was very comfortable to wear, but it only lasted for four and a half hours on me. The formula felt lightly hydrating overall.",B+
MAC,PUMPKIN,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark pink with strong, warm undertones and a cream finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque, while the texture was lightweight, creamy with some slip, and comfortable to wear. It stayed on well for five hours and was lightly moisturizing but some color settled into my lip lines over time.",A-
MAC,POMEGRANATE,Lipstick,"an intense, bright pink-red with cool undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff in a single layer with a smooth, velvety consistency that glided across the lips with ease and delivered even, smooth color coverage. The lipstick wore well for over six hours, left a stain behind, and was very lightly moisturizing over time.",A
MAC,LINDA,Blush,"a medium-dark, almost burnt orange with warm, reddish undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that applied evenly to bare skin and blended out without issue. The consistency was smooth and finely-milled; the blush felt more velvety and refined than MAC‚Äôs typical powder blush (including the previously released version of this same shade). It stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me.",A
PAT MCGRATH,SUBVERSIVE,Palette,"a new, permanent palette that features 10 eyeshadows in a variety of finishes that has warmer-toned shades with a few pops of cooler pink/violet kind of shades. The brand has divided their eyeshadows into two finishes: Powderluxe Pressed Eye Shadows (matte, pearl, and sparkle finishes) and ‚Äúmodern, hybrid pigmented formulas‚Äù (I‚Äôm not sure why one type got an official name and the other did not!) with the latter having ‚Äúmetallic, satin sheen, iridescence, and holographic brilliance finishes.‚Äù",B+
MAC,RHUBARB #2,Blush,"a deep, reddened copper with warm, orange undertones and a metallic sheen. It had rich color payoff with a soft, velvety consistency that almost effortless to use when it came to blending and diffusing the edges. The lack of powderiness made it easy to use a lighter hand or less-dense brush to get sheerer coverage and build up if desired. The finish was luminous without accentuating my skin‚Äôs natural texture. On me, it lasted for nine hours before fading noticeably. I wish MAC‚Äôs regular powder blush range used this formula‚Äìit‚Äôs so much more luxurious and easy to blend!",A+
MAC,COOL,Palette,"a muted plum, muted pink, and a muted coral, which made it a good set for someone who likes softer, more muted and traditionally ‚Äúwearable‚Äù shades. They were consistent with MAC‚Äôs lipstick formula overall. I was, however, confused why this was the ‚ÄúCool‚Äù kit, when I felt all shades were warmer, whereas the ‚ÄúWarm‚Äù kit included a really blue-based red (but they are all correctly labeled/attributed as I have them here!).",B+
MAC,GWENDOLYN,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, purple-leaning taupe with neutral-to-cool undertones and a satin finish. There were fine pearls strewn thorughout, but it did not read metallic or shimmery in person. The consistency had moderate slip, and unfortunately, the color went on unevenly and was prone to settling in my lip lines. It wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",B-
MAC,VALIANT,Lipstick,"a deep, plummy black with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. There was fine pearl strewn throughout the lipstick, though it did not actually seem shimmery in person. The texture was lightly creamy with slight slip but not enough to feel slippery while worn. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that went on somewhat evenly with some color gathering in my lip lines. The lipstick stayed on well for five and a half hours and was neither drying nor moisturizing.",B+
MAC,MODERN TEMPTRESS,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark brown with subtle, warm red undertones and very fine gold and copper pearl. It had good color coverage in a single layer, which was buldable to full coverage. The consistency was lightly creamy and had a bit of slip (definitely not matte!), so it glided on without dragging but did not look patchy. This shade lasted for six hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
MAC,BEATRIX,Lipstick,"a deep, reddened burgundy with subtle, cool undertones and fine, ruby red pearl. It had good pigmentation with a velvety consistency that glided on without tugging but adhered well to the lips and did not slide around. It wore well for over six hours and was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",A
MAC,VICTORIAN,Lipstick,"a muted, dark brown with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had good pigmentation in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The texture was lightweight, smooth, and velvety without feeling clingy or too slippery. The color stayed on well for five and a half hours and felt a touch drying.",A-
MAC,VELVET REBELLION,Lipstick,"a deep plum with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. The consistency was velvety and smooth, which made it easy to pull the lipstick across my lips and not have it drag or tug. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that covered my lips evenly with just a bit of color getting into my deeper lip lines. The lipstick wore well for six and a half hours on me and was non-drying.",A
CIATE,"PRETTY, FUN, FEARLESS VOLUME II",Palette,"a new, limited edition palette for the holidays. It includes 20 eyeshadows along with a full-sized liquid liner (not reviewed here), miniature-sized liquid lipstick, and mascara (not reviewed here). The eyeshadows are supposed to be ‚Äúpacked full of gorgeous pigment‚Äù and have ‚Äúultimate blendability and massive color payoff.‚Äù",C
COLOUR POP,NOW AND ZEN,Eyeshadow,"a bright, white gold with a green-to-gold duochrome shift. The texture was smooth, slightly cream-like, and incredibly easy to blend out on the lid. It had rich color payoff in a single layer that stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me.",A
COLOUR POP,TEA GARDEN,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, reddish-copper with green-to-gold shifting shimmer. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a loosely-pressed consistency that did not apply as evenly with a dry brush as expected. The texture was a bit thicker and needed the aid of a dampened brush to apply smoothly and have greater coverage. It wore well for eight hours on me.",B
COLOUR POP,GLASS BULL,Eyeshadow,"a medium, pinky-plum base with blue-to-teal shifting shimmer. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly to the lid with a highly metallic sheen. The eyeshadow had a moderately dense consistency that applied best with fingertips or a dampened brush for more opaque coverage. It wore well for eight hours on me.",B+
COLOUR POP,SNAKE EYES,Eyeshadow,"a medium brown with warm, rosy undertones and a metallic sheen. It had rich pigmentation with a fairly soft, smooth, and blendable texture that was just a smidgen on the looser side. The color lasted well for eight hours on me.",A-
COLOUR POP,DRAGONFLY,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark taupe-brown with warm, rosy undertones and a frosted sheen. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, while the consistency was soft, smooth, and blendable without being too softly or too firmly pressed in the pan. The color started to fade on me after eight hours of wear.",A-
COLOUR POP,LET'S DO IT,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark black with neutral-to-cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. There were faint micro-shimmers strewn throughout the powder, but it looked like a matte eyeshadow in practice. The texture was slightly drier and could have been m ore blendable, though the color coverage was very nearly opaque. The eyeshadow stayed on well for eight hours on me.",B
CHANEL,TRAIT DE CARACTERE,Eyeshadow,"a smoky, earthy set of shades housed in a black compact. I wanted to like it, as it was a more unusual set of shades for the holiday season, but the formula is just so powdery, prone to sheering out, and short-wearing that it left me incredibly disappointed. More often than not, Chanel‚Äôs 5-pan palettes are unimpressive, and it always makes me wonder why they didn‚Äôt just make a quad instead, where the formula is stronger.",F
MAC,GOLD,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette that includes six eyeshadows. They are nearly full-sized (the Dazzleshadow shades are slightly less at 0.04 oz. but the other four are actually 0.05 oz. each, which is full-sized). The palette left something to be desired, as they were not the most usable or blendable on their own. This was a palette that required primer and/or a glitter adhesive to work well.",C+
URBAN DECAY,VICE METAL MEETS MATTE,Palette,"12 lipsticks‚Äìsix shimmery shades, six mattes‚Äìwith a mix of new, exclusive shades and ones from the permanent range. It includes a retractable lip brush. I think it‚Äôs a nice way to try a lot of shades from the Vice formula, but I recommend thinking critically about how you use your lip products‚Äìsome use a lip brush regularly and won‚Äôt mind that step while others like to keep their lip color on them throughout the day and carrying around a whole palette may or may not be feasible. The formula, overall, feels a little less dense and creamy compared to the full-sized versions (when available) but have similar coverage, wear, and application.",B+
COLOUR POP,TWO BIRDS,Eyeshadow,"a vibrant, medium-dark gold with warm, orange undertones and a metallic finish. It had opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly to the lid. The texture was soft, moderately dense, and slightly cream-like, which helped it blend out easily. This shade wore well for eight and a half hours on me.",A
COLOUR POP,FORTUNE COOKIE,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium pinky-red with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had rich color payoff in a single layer with a slightly drier texture that wasn‚Äôt too powdery nor was it prone to sheering out, but it just had a dryness present to it, possibly due to the thinner consistency. The color wore well for eight and a half hours and stained my lids slightly (and it is technically not an eyeshadow).",A-
COLOUR POP,KOI,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium tangerine orange with warm, yellow undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was smooth, velvety, and easily blended on the lid. The eyeshadow was richly pigmented and wore well for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.",A-
COLOUR POP,LUCKY YOU,Eyeshadow,"a light pink with warm undertones and a matte finish. The pigmentation was opaque, while the texture was slightly dusty in the pan but did not appear dry nor was it prone to sheering out on bare skin. It lasted for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
COLOUR POP,FACET,Eyeshadow,"a deep plum with warm undertones and a matte finnish. It had good color payoff in a single layer, which was buildable to opaque coverage with a second layer. The eyeshadow was soft, slightly dusty in the pan, but it did not appear to have any ill-effects on the application, as it applied evenly and blended out nicely. This shade wore well for eight hours on me.",B+
COLOUR POP,SO JADED,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium pink with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. The texture was slightly loose, so it had some excess product that kicked up in the pan and applied better with a flatter brush, patted on, than swept on to minimize fallout and maximize coverage. It had opaque pigmentation that lasted for eight hours before fading slightly on me.",B+
COLOUR POP,IMPERIAL,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, rusty orange with warm,r ed undertones and a matte finish. It had rich color payoff with a soft, powdery consistency that had some excess get kicked up in the pan, so I would recommend using a lighter hand and building up coverage to minimize fallout and messiness. The color wore well for eight hours on me.",B+
COLOUR POP,CROWN JEWEL,Eyeshadow,"a dark purple with subtle, warm undertones and a frosted finish. It had opaque pigmentation with a soft, smooth consistency that was blendable and easy to use. The color wore well for eight hours on me.",A-
COLOUR POP,HUNG UP,Eyeshadow,"a dark, plummy purple with warm, brown undertones and a pearly sheen. It had good pigmentation with a slightly drier consistency that could have been a little more blendable along the edges, but it wasn‚Äôt a true struggle and was quite workable. This shade lasted for seven and a half hours on me.",B
COLOUR POP,PAPER CRANE,Eyeshadow,"a dark, coppery brown with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. The consistency was moderately dense and almost cream-like to the touch, so it applied best with flat, firm, synthetic brushes over fluffy ones, as fluffier brushes did not pick up product as well nor did they apply the color as evenly. It had rich color payoff that wore well for nine hours on me.",A
COLOUR POP,ROUNDHOUSE,Eyeshadow,"a deep brown with neutral-to-cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. There were nearly imperceptible pearl strewn through the powder, but it looked more like a matte eyeshadow on the lid. It had intense pigmentation in a single layer with a smooth, velvety consistency that wasn‚Äôt too thin or too dense. The eyeshadow blended out without too much work along the edges and stayed on well for eight hours.",B+
MAC,ROSE GOLD,Eyeshadow,"a new, limited palette that contains six eyeshadows. It‚Äôs housed in a slim compact, and each eyeshadow is almost the equivalent of a full-sized MAC eyeshadow (0.047 oz. vs. 0.05 oz.). The shades came together without too much work as each eyeshadow was fairly pigmented, blendable, and long-wearing. There are two Dazzleshadows, which are more glittery shades, so if that‚Äôs not your cup of tea, you might find them harder to work with or too sparkly for your preferences.",B
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,SNAKE CHARMER,Eyeshadow,"five miniature-sized glosses. All shades are part of the permanent range, so they can be purchased individually or repurchased should you favor one. Per the brand, the formula is supposed to have ‚Äúmaximum color and brilliance‚Äù that ‚Äúnever [feels] sticky‚Äù and has mint scent.",B
MAC,SMOKY GOLD,Eyeshadow,"an easy-to-wear duo featuring a light gold and dark, warm taupe along with a dark brown eyeliner and mascara. For review purposes, the mascara is not included in the review. The eyeshadows were fairly easy to work with, and I expect if you normally use a primer or like to use your shimmery eyeshadows with a dampened brush, you‚Äôll enjoy the eyeshadows quite a bit. The eyeliner was comfortable to use and long-wearing.",A-
NARS,GLASS TEARS,Eyeshadow,"a new, limited edition eyeshadow palette with six shades in a dark, smoky color combination. It was a decent to good palette overall, and I think the colors worked well together, though one might want to bring in a few brighter, lighter colors to get the most usage out of the palette‚Äôs shades. The formula was softer and more pigmented than the average NARS‚Äô eyeshadow (like their permanent singles and duos).",B+
DIOR,GOLD ESSENCE (212),Lipgloss,"a medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and fine, golden pearl. It had semi-sheer color coverage where the gloss lightened and warmed-up my natural lip color while also adding a moderate amount of shimmer and finer pearl. It had a noticeable sheen and a very creamy, smooth consistency. The gloss lasted for three hours, was hydrating, but prone to color gathering in my lip lines over time. There was a slight, floral scent but no discernible taste.",C
DIOR,RUBY ESSENCE (778),Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark reddish plum with warm undertones and fine ruby red pearl and a glossy finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that covered the lips fairly evenly. The gloss was smooth, lightweight, and almost cream-like as it was so comfortable to wear and had no tackiness. It wore well for four hours, kept my lips moisturized, and sat well on my lips throughout the wear. There was a slight, floral scent but no discernible taste.",B+
DIOR,PRECIOUS ROCKS (001),Highlighter,"a pale, buttery yellow powder with flecks of gold sparkle. The powder is supposed to be ‚Äúthe finishing touch‚Äù and have a ‚Äúsubtle, golden shimmer‚Äù and a ‚Äúdelicate glow.‚Äù The brand says that it can be applied to ‚Äúthe cheekbones, the chin, and the nose‚Äù or even ‚Äúto your decollete and shoulders.‚Äù",B+
MAC,SMOKY PINK,Palette,"a new, limited edition trio of products housed in a holiday makeup bag. For review purposes, I am not reviewing the mascara, only the eyeliner and eyeshadow duo. There was only one new shade within the kit (Light of the Silvery Moon). If you normally use your eyeshadows with a dampened brush, you‚Äôll probably have no trouble using the duo, but I did find the formula to feel a little drier and looser in the pan compared to past Extra Dimension eyeshadows.",A
MAC,SO OBSESSED,Palette,"12 miniature-sized lipsticks with two new, exclusive shades with the rest being from the permanent line or were repromotes‚Ä¶ except that Ruby Woo and Flat Out Fabulous, which are Retro Mattes, are listed as a Matte in the kit and does, in fact, have a different consistency finish‚Äìwith Ruby Woo, the different was noticeable, whereas with Flat Out Fabulous it wasn‚Äôt quite as drastic. I think it is odd to include permanent shades but change the finish (even slightly), though. Otherwise, I loved the kit overall; I think MAC did a fantastic job packaging the set to the types of shades included, and the price point is just right.",A
NARS,THE VEIL,Palette,"a trio of ‚Äúbuildable‚Äù powders that includes limited edition blush and highlighting shades. If you like your cheek colors more pigmented, the trio might work for you, but if you were holding onto the concept of ‚Äúbuildable,‚Äù then I think you may be more disappointed.",B
VISEART,GRANDE PRO (VOL. 1),Palette,"30 eyeshadows with six repromoted from previous palettes and 24 that are new and exclusive to the palette. The palette is going to work best for someone who prefers various tones of neutrals, more muted tones, some deeper, smokier shades, and tends to build up their pigmentation. The texture of many shades was soft and blendable but a few were stiff, grainy, or more difficult to blend out on the skin. I found that most shades that did not seem that pigmented were slightly more pigmented in practice or else they built up within two to three layers. For the most part, the palette was easy to use and I didn‚Äôt notice some of the pigmentation issues that seemed more obvious from just swatching alone.",B
MAC,WARM ICE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium gold with warmer undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that wasn‚Äôt buildable to full coverage. The texture was smooth, lightly emollient, and easy to work with as the lipstick glided across lips with ease. Despite the strong sheen, it did not seem prone to emphasizing the texture of my lips. It wore well for four hours and was non-drying.",B+
MAC,HOLIDAY CRUSH,Lipstick,"a medium-dark gold with warm, brownundertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque color payoff that applied evenly across the lips. The consistency was lightweight, thin but not clingy, and creamy enough to glide on without tugging but did not feel slippery on the lips during wear. This shade stayed on well for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
MAC,SHIMMER AND SPICE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, reddish plum with warm undertones and multi-colored sparkle and micro-glitter. It had semi-sheer to medium, buildable coverage with a moderately emollient consistency that had noticeable slip once applied. I could feel the edges of the sparkles in the lipstick as I applied it, though they did not feel rough or scratchy. It went on fairly evenly, despite the sheerness and slip. On me, it lasted for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",C+
FENTY BEAUTY,SUPERMOON,Lipstick,"a medium coral with warm, orange undertones and fine gold pearl and flecks of pink sparkle. It had medium coverage, which was buildable to semi-opaque pigmentation. The texture was smooth, lightweight, and balmy‚Äìemollient but not heavy‚Äìso it skated across the lips without tugging. This one had the least amount of larger sparkle in it, so those who prefer a smoother sheen may find this one most to their liking. It wore well for four hours and was moisturizing.",A-
FENTY BEAUTY,SUPANOVA,Lipstick,"a medium, pinky lavender with warmer undertones and flecks of gold glitter. It had medium coverage that was buildable to semi-opaque coverage with two to three layers. The lipstick was creamy, lightweight, and had moderate slip, but this shade applied the worst‚Äìit wasn‚Äôt even and there was a moderate amount of product that got into my lip lines and pulled away at them. The color lasted for four hours on me, and the formula was lightly hydrating.",C+
FENTY BEAUTY,GRAVITY,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink with cool undertones and cooler pink sparkle. It had medium coverage that was buildable to semi-opaque pigmentation. The lipstick was creamy with moderate slip but felt lightweight with just a bit of color getting into my lip lines. It was comfortable to wear, as it was quite moisturizing, over the four hours it wore well for.",B+
FENTY BEAUTY,SCI FLY,Lipstick,"a deep plum with subtle, warm undertones and flecks of plum, purple, and pink sparkle. It had semi-opaque coverage that went on fairly evenly, but I did find it looked patchy along the center of my mouth as the more balm-like texture did not want to adhere ase well to that area. There was slight color that pulled into my deeper lip lines, though the glossy finish helped to camouflage that from a normal viewing distance. It wore well for four hours on me and was hydrating.",B
DIOR,EMERALD (347),Palette,"a new, limited edition green-hued set of shades for the holidays. For a Dior palette, it was surprisingly good, but there were two under-performing shades (center and bottom right). I think the sheerness of the deepest may make it easier to work with it gradually for some, so that might not be a deal-breaker for anyone who prefers their deeper shades to have buildable coverage. The center shade was far stiffer than it should have been, though.",B+
FENTY BEAUTY,SPACESUIT,Lipgloss,"a peachy coral base with warm, orange undertones and flecks of magenta-to-golden pink shifting sparkle. It had semi-opaque coverage that applied evenly but had a bit of product gather in my deeper lip lines. The high-shine finish made that settling difficult to notice at a normal viewing distance, though. The consistency was smooth, comfortable to wear, and had moderate tackiness, which helped it last longer (four and a half hours).",A-
FENTY BEAUTY,GAL ON THE MOON,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark plum with subtle, warm undertones and cooler blue and green glitter and fine multi-colored shimmer strewn throughout. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied beautifully on the lips: even coverage and a smoothing effect as the gloss didn‚Äôt gather in my lip lines and seemed to erase them, too. The formula was moisturizing while worn, while the color lasted for five hours.",A
FENTY BEAUTY,PLUTONIC RELATIONSHIP,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium-dark reddish fuchsia with cooler undertones and flecks of cool violet and blue sparkle. It had good color payoff in a single layer that applied evenly across the lips. The texture was smooth and did not get into my lip lines, despite also feeling creamier on the lips. The gloss stayed on well for five and a half hours on me and felt moisturizing over time.",A
FENTY BEAUTY,ASTRO NAUGHTY,Lipgloss,"a dark, reddened plum with warm undertones and fine, multi-colored sparkle. It medium coverage, which was buildable to semi-opaque, but it was most comfortable to wear with just a single layer of product. It could have applied more evenly, though. The consistency was smooth, lightweight, moderately tacky, and comfortable to wear. It lasted for five hours and was hydrating.",B+
MAC,HERE COMES JOY,Highlighter,"a soft, coppery gold with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had medium, buildable color coverage‚Äìup to semi-opaque using three layers‚Äìwith a soft, lightly powdery consistency that felt almost cream-like, as it had a bit of denseness and had a velvety feel. The highlighter applied evenly to the skin, blended out without trouble, and did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before fading. It was a nice highlighter overall, though it wasn‚Äôt as pigmented as described by the brand.",B+
MAC,FROSTWINKED,Eyeshadow,"a pale, white gold with a gold-to-green shifting sparkle. It had sheer coverage applied dry with semi-opaque coverage applied with a dampened brush. The consistency was drier and on the flakier side, so the product needed to be applied with fingertips or using a dampened brush to help the powder come together and apply more evenly to the skin. It wore well for seven hours on me with minor fallout over time.",B
MAC,IT'S SNOWING,Eyeshadow,"a medium, plummy pink with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque coverage applied dry, and the color itself appeared lighter and more faded compared to application with a dampened brush, where it was fully opaque and a bit deeper. The texture was smoother and blendable, and it was the easiest to work with out of the four I tested. It stayed on well for seven and a half hours.",A
MAC,DELICATE DRIFT,Eyeshadow,"a light, orange-toned gold base with peach-to-pink shifting sparkle. It had semi-sheer coverage applied dry, which intensified to mostly opaque coverage when applied with a dampened brush. The consistency was drier and with the amount of sparkle, almost gritty to the touch, so it did not work well dry as it had a lot of fallout and did not adhere well to the lid. With a dampened brush, it went on more smoothly and had more coverage, though I would recommend an adhesive base (even someting like MAC Fix+ helps a lot) to maximize coverage, evenness of application, and wear. On its own, it lasted for six hours (which is, surprisingly, what the wear time is marketed as) with minor fallout (used with a dampened brush).",B-
MAC,STYLISHLY MERRY #2,Eyeshadow,"a medium, golden copper base with gold-to-pink shifting sparkle. The texture was drier and looser with noticeable sparkly bits, so it was not particularly easy to use dry, as there was a lot of fallout and the color went on unevenly. With a dampened brush or over an adhesive base, it applied with better, more even coverage and looked smoother overall. It lasted for seven hours on me with slight fallout over time (applied with a dampened brush).",B+
GUERLAIN,GOLD PEARL,Highlighter,"a translucent, light beige powder with warmer undertones and flecks of larger, light gold sparkle. The effect was slightly smoothing with stray, visible sparkles on my skin. The latter effect is not something evreyone is going to appreciate, so keep the sparkle factor in mind if noticeable shimmer or glitter on the skin is a deal-breaker!",C+
MAC,BEETROOT,Lipstick,"a dark, purply plum with warm, pink undertones and a natural sheen. It had nearly opaque color payoff that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. The consistency was firmer in the tube and melted upon contact with the lips, so it took a second or two to warm up and really glide effortlessly across my lips. It wore well for six hours, left a slight stain behind, and was lightly hydrating.",B+
MAC,NOBLESSE,Lipstick,"a deep purple with warm undertones and a glossy finish. It had semi-opaque coverage and did not apply evenly‚Äìthe color looked patchy in places as if the pigments weren‚Äôt mixed well within the lipstick. There was some color that pulled into my lip lines quickly, too. The consistency was lightweight, lightly tacky, and had moderate slip, which might have been why it did not apply as nicely as most shades in the Liptensity formula have in the past. On me, it lasted for six hours, left a stain behind, and was non-drying. This is a shade that would benefit greatly from a lip liner!",C-
MAC,FIRE ROASTED,Lipstick,"a deep, coppery red with warm undertones and a cream finish. The lipstick was intensely pigmented with a smooth, creamy consistency that was slightly firm in the tube but seemed to melt faster on the lips than other shades in the range. The color applied evenly on the lips and stayed in place for seven and a half hours. The formula was comfortable to wear and lightly moisturizing.",A+
FENTY BEAUTY,GALAXY,Palette,"14 glittering eyeshadows housed in a sleek, multi-chrome compact. (The only downside is the compact attracts fingerprints like crazy!) Fenty says that the palette contains a mix of ‚Äúsheer, glittering topcoats‚Äù and ‚Äúsmoky, shimmer-drenched hues.‚Äù When it comes to application advise, the brand says to ‚Äúwear eye shadows solo for a sheer-to-smoky multidimensional effect‚Äù or to ‚Äúlayer topcoats over any eye shadow.‚Äù The ‚Äúpro tip‚Äù is to ‚Äúwet your brush‚Äù if you want a ‚Äúmore intense look.‚Äù",B-
MAC,BITE O' GEORGIA,Lipstick,"a light, peachy coral with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that did not apply as evenly as most of the Liptensity range has in the past. This one seemed almost grainy as bits of color seemed to clump up on my lips. Even though it had a glossier, the color read chalky. The texture was smooth, firm in the bullet with slight tackiness. It wore well for four and a half hours and was non-drying.",C
MAC,KING SALMON,Lipstick,"a bright, medium coral with warm undertones and a creamy finish. The consistency was smooth, firmer but not stiff, and easy to apply to the lips. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly to the lips, but I felt like this one had a bit more slip to it and was harder to get to adhere to the inner portion of my lips. The color stayed on well for six hours and was lightly hydrating.",B
MAC,GINGER ROSE,Lipstick,"a medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. The color payoff was good, though just shy of full coverage. It had a lightweight consistency with slight tackiness and a creamier feel, so it was comfortable to wear. This shade wore well for five and a half hours on me and was non-drying.",B
COLOUR POP,TRICKLES,Highlighter,"a light-medium lavender with warm, pink undertones and a cool, violet pearl. It had semi-opaque coverage, which was somewhat buildable, but the texture was incredibly dense and tended to apply unevenly as the product clumped up on the skin. It was actually a powder that applied better with a synthetic brush or fingertips rather than a natural hair, fluffy brush as it needed more to break up and smooth out the powder. The highlighter stayed on well for eight hours on me before fading.",B-
URBAN DECAY,STIX AND BONES,Eyeliner,"a shimmer base of blackened plum with warm, brown undertones and larger flecks of green, plum, and copper glitter. It had semi-sheer coverage, which was somewhat buildable, but the darker base made it appear more uneven and patchy when used on its own. When layered over something deeper (like brown or black eyeliner), it looked sparkly and pretty. This shade stayed on well for nine hours with minimal fallout.",B+
URBAN DECAY,PUNK ROCK,Eyeliner,"a medium-dark, plummy brown base of fine shimmer and larger, multi-colored glitter. It had semi-sheer coverage, which was in line with the brand‚Äôs description, that could be built up if the wiper was removed or if layered two to three times (wait for each layer to dry). The consistency was thin, watery but not too runny, and dried down quickly. The eyeliner wore well for nine hours with minimal fallout.",A-
URBAN DECAY,GAMMA RAY,Eyeliner,"a mix of medium and navy blue glitter particles suspended in a clear base. The consistency was thin, lightweight, and water-like, and the brush-type applicator dispersed a fairly even line of semi-sheer glitter without much effort. It was buildable to fuller coverage, though it was easiest to used layered over an another product (eyeshadow or eyeliner). It lasted for eight and a half hours with minimal fallout.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,ROSIE,Lipstick,"a medium pink with cool, blue undertones and a pearly sheen. It had good pigmentation in a single layer, though it was not full coverage, even built up. The texture was lightly creamy with moderate slip, so it was easy to slide the lipstick across my lips, but there was a bit of settling into my lip lines. The color applied fairly evenly but could have been improved. This shade wore well for four hours and was lightly moisturizing.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,ZELDA,Lipstick,"a deep fuchsia with cool, blue undertones and a natural sheen. The lipstick had a smooth, lightweight consistency that glided across the lips like a balm, never skipping or tugging, and delivered even coverage. The lipstick was only semi-opaque, and it did not build up to full coverage. It wore well for four and a half hours and was hydrating over time.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,BIANCA,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark plum with cooler undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly across the lips and never tugged. The texture was lightweight, thinner but not clingy, and balm-like‚Äìcreamy but not thick, emollient but not slippery. It stayed on well for five hours and left a slight stain behind, while the formula felt hydrating.",A-
GUERLAIN,FLAMING RED (823),Lipstick,"a medium red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a smattering of gold micro-glitter. It had nearly opaque color coverage in a single layer. The texture was lightweight, emollient and slightly creamy without feeling too wet or too slippery on the lips with just a bit of texture from the micro-glitter in the bullet itself. The lipstick sat well on the lips and smoothed out a lot of my lip lines. It wore well for five and a half hours and was nicely hydrating over time.",A
GUERLAIN,GLAMOROUS CHERRY (822),Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium pinky red with cool, blue undertones and barely-there gold sparkle. The pigmentation was almost full coverage in a single stroke, but there was a smidgen of translucency throughout the shade. The color went on evenly, though, and the finish seemed to have a higher shine than most Rouge Gs. It had a creamy texture that was thicker compared to Flaming Red but not actually heavy or slippery on the lips. It wore well for five hours and left a slight stain behind.",A
COLOUR POP,STARFLOWER,Highlighter,"a medium gold with warm, orange undertones and a metallic sheen. The consistency was soft, smooth, and almost cream-like as it was a denser powder without any powderiness or excess product that kicked up in the pan. It had opaque coverage but was forgiving, so I could easily blend out the powder for sheerer coverage if desired. The highlighter wore well for eight and a half hours on me.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,GALA,Lipstick,"a medium-dark orange-red with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It had medium coverage that was buildable to semi-opaque coverage in two layers. The consistency was lightweight, almost balm-like as it was emollient but thin. This shade wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,ISLA,Lipstick,"a medium, pink-coral with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had good color coverage in a single layer, but the texture was too emollient, so there was some slip when worn but slight streaking and color that pulled into my lip lines over time. It lasted for three and a half hours on me and was hydrating.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,MARIKO,Lipstick,"a medium orange with warm, red undertones and fine, gold pearl. It had semi-opaque color payoff that went on evenly and smoothly across the lips. The consistency was lightweight, moderately emollient, and had just a bit of color that pulled into my lip lines due to the slip. The lipstick stayed on well for four and a half hours, while the formula felt moisturizing.",B+
COVER FX,PERFECT,Palette,"six powder highlighters housed in a slim, plastic compact. The formula is supposed to be ‚Äúultra silky‚Äù and ‚Äúhighly pigmented.‚Äù I‚Äôd argue that the texture of the shades included in the palette felt creamier and denser than the standalone powder highlighters by the same formula name, and I found myself enjoying the feel and look of these even more than the standalone formula. All six shades were blendable, pigmented, long-wearing, and flattering on‚ÄìI was surprised at how metallic some of them appeared on my skin yet did not seem to bring attention to my natural texture.",A
CHANEL,SILVER SCREEN (822),Eyeshadow,"a smoldering, medium-dark taupe with subtle, warm olive undertones and a sparkling finish. It had semi-opaque coverage in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage by applying a second layer on top. The consistency was smooth, thin, and workable along the edges as a standalone eyeshadow. It wasn‚Äôt my favorite sheered out as the darker color did not appear as even when sheered out drastically. It lasted without creasing for 14 hours but had slight fallout after 10 hours of wear.",B
CHANEL,ROMANCE (784),Lipgloss,"a medium red with neutral-to-cool undertones and a jelly-like finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered the lips fairly evenly, though it seemed like some color gathered in my lip lines but the mirror-like shine made that fade into the background to my eye. The gloss was smooth, non-tacky, and almost gel-like as it felt plusher and very comfortable on the lips. The color stayed on well for four and a half hours and was moisturizing over time.",B+
CHANEL,LEGENDARY GREEN (857),Eyeliner,"a deep, forest green with subtle, cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in a single stroke, which was buildable to opaque coverage with two layers. The consistency was smooth and lightly creamy, so it glided across the skin without skipping or tugging but did not slide around or smudge. It wore well for nine hours on my lower lash line before starting to fade noticeably.",A-
NATASHA DENONA,JOYA,Palette,"a new, limited edition holiday offering that features a new formula‚Äìthe brand‚Äôs ‚Äúcream-powder hybrid shadow.‚Äù The new formula is supposed to have ‚Äúpigment-rich coverage of a cream‚Äù with the ‚Äúlong-lasting, crease-free wear of a powder.‚Äù From what I could tell, this just meant a slightly denser feel with less dustiness/powderiness but wasn‚Äôt anything outside of normal range in texture for a powder eyeshadow. Most of the shades had good, buildable pigmentation and were blendable on the lid with eight to nine hour wear and minor fallout (three shades are quite sparkly).",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,NINA,Lipstick,"a muted, medium coral with warm, orange undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-sheer color payoff in a single layer, which applied evenly across the lips and did not appear streaky. There was a very slight amount of product that gathered in my deeper lip lines but was not noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The texture was lightly emollient so it glided on nicely but was thin and lightweight. It lasted for two and a half hours on me and was lightly moisturizing.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,MARGUERITE,Lipstick,"a soft pink with subtle, cool undertones and a frosted finish. It had sheer coverage‚Äìmore shimmer than color‚Äìthat applied evenly and easily across the lips. The consistency was lightweight, thin but not clingy, and never dragged when I applied it directly to my lips. This shade wore well for two and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,ALICIA,Lipstick,"a soft, medium pink with very subtle, warm undertones and a luminous finish. It had semi-sheer color payoff that applied somewhat evenly, but there was visible streaking along the edges and some color that gathered in my lip lines. The texture was thin, emollient but not slippery, and felt a bit clingy compared to most of the shades in the range. It wore well for two and a half hours on me and was non-drying.",B-
ANASTASIA,TROUBLE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium rosy mauve with neutral-to-cool undertones and a flat, matte finish. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, thinner texture that spread evenly across my lips but took a bit longer to dry down. I felt like it was a bit too fluid, so I had to take extra care along the edges of my l ips. On me, the color wore well for six and a half hours and was slightly drying.",A-
ANASTASIA,ROCK SAND,Lipstick,"a deep, plummy brown with neutral-to-warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. It had opaque color payoff in a single layer, and the liquid lipstick applied evenly and smoothly across the lips with little effort. The texture was lightweight, thin, and almost runny, but it stayed in place in practice. It lasted for seven and a half hours and was moderately drying.",A-
ANASTASIA,STARFISH,Lipstick,"a medium brown with warm, yellow undertones and a flat, matte finish. The pigmentation was opaque, while the consistency was smooth, thinner but not runny, so it spread evenly across my lips and dried down well. This shade wore well for six and a half hours and was somewhat drying.",A-
PAT MCGRATH,MADAME GREIGE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium mauve with neutral-to-cool undertones and a satin sheen. It had rich color payoff in a single layer with a smooth, creamy texture that was slightly denser and thicker than many formulas on the market, but it didn‚Äôt actually feel heavy on the lips. The lipstick was easy to apply and comfortable to wear, which was a good thing given it lasted for six and a half hours on me. It also felt moisturizing while I wore it.",A+
PAT MCGRATH,SORRY NOT SORRY,Lipstick,"a medium, pinky-plum with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had opaque color coverage in a single layer, which applied smoothly and evenly across the lips. The texture was lightweight, dense but not heavy in feel, and more flattering than most lipsticks (and my lips are in rougher shape from an abnormal amount of swatching). It wore well for over seven hours and was hydrating over time.",A+
MAC,SMOKY SLEIGH,Palette,"a new, limited edition eyeshadow palette that contains four mattes (beige, mauve, cool brown, black) and two shimmers (pale silver, muted teal) housed in a slim, shimmery red compact. The colors coordinated better than I anticipated once I started to work with the eyeshadows on my eye, though the quality could have been better with most of the shades. Go figure that the matte black was the best shade in the entire palette! Worth noting, while the compact might seem like a good size, it‚Äôs actually much less product than typical MAC Eyeshadow Quads (which are 0.19 oz. and this is 0.10 oz.).",C+
CHANEL,LEGENDARY GREEN (857),Eyeliner,"a deep, forest green with subtle, cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in a single stroke, which was buildable to opaque coverage with two layers. The consistency was smooth and lightly creamy, so it glided across the skin without skipping or tugging but did not slide around or smudge. It wore well for nine hours on my lower lash line before starting to fade noticeably.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,LEIGH,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque color payoff in a single stroke. It felt creamy, lightly emollient, and never dragged or tugged on the lips. The color went on evenly, though there was slight product that settled into my deeper lip lines but wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance. It wore well for four hours and was moisturizing.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,RINKO,Lipstick,"a brighter, medium pink with warmer, yellow undertones and a pearly sheen. It had good pigmentation in a single layer, though it was definitely not a full-coverage product. The lipstick was creamy with moderate slip, and it did feel a bit on the slippery side during wear. While it was comfortable to wear, there was color that gathered in my lip lines over the four hours the color lasted for. The formula felt lightly hydrating overall.",B-
DIOR,PRECIOUS ROCKS (864),Blush,"a medium, pink-coral with warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. There was fine gold sparkle on top of the powder, but it did not go all the way through. The texture was dry with a very chalky base that was difficult to pick up evenly with a brush, blend out. The coverage was sheer, though the brand described it as a ‚Äúsheer peach.‚Äù The issue I had with this was just how poorly it applied‚Äìit was patchy and uneven, as the powder seemed to grab onto the skin and not want to move. It lasted for a mere four hours on me before fading noticeably.",F
DIOR,PRECIOUS ROCKS (001),Highlighter,"a soft, peachy beige with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had opaque color coverage in a single layer, but the consistency was incredibly smooth, velvety, and finely-milled, so it was easy to sheer out if desired. The powder sat well on the skin and yielded a smooth, luminous sheen‚Äìsomewhere between subtle and moderate in terms of reflectiveness. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before fading slightly.",A
ANASTASIA,GRADIENT,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette with four blushes for the holiday season. Unfortunately, it was a miss‚Äìthe formula just did not work well for blending, and when it comes to a cheek color, I imagine getting an even layer with diffused, gradual edges is really a must for most. Something about splotchy, patchy blush with harsh lines says, ‚Äúno, thank you‚Äù in my mind.",D-
NARS,FETISHIZED,Blush,"a vibrant, medium-dark pinky coral with warm, orange undertones and a pearly sheen. The finish was particularly lovely on this blush, as it appeared luminous and glowy without being visibly sparkly or so metallic that it emphasized my skin‚Äôs texture.",A+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,NATALIA,Lipstick,"a medium, golden copper with warm, sparkling copper and gold pearl and micro-sparkle. The consistency of this one was more textured‚ÄìI could feel the sparkle in the tube‚Äìbut it wasn‚Äôt scratchy or rough. It had sheer coverage that applied somewhat evenly but had a tendency to build up in my lip lines, and the shimmer/sparkle did not disperse as evenly as I would have liked. I expected this one to perform more in line with the rest but was actually quite under-performing. It lasted for two hours on me and was lightly moisturizing.",C-
TOO FACED,SO PEACHY,Blush,"a bright, meidum pink with subtle, warm undertones and a satin sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in a single layer, though it was hard to maintain the same intensity applied and blended out on cheeks.",D
URBAN DECAY,DELUSIONAL,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, reddish plum with warm undertones and flecks of lighter purple glitter. It had a semi-sheer base color that applied evenly, but the sparkles did not disperse evenly across the lips, so some areas had almost no sparkle/glitter while others had quite a bit. The consistency was thin, watery, and easy to spread across the lips but hard to apply precisely along the edges. The color wore well for five and a half hours but some glitter flaked away over time. It was somewhat drying on me.",D+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,BEATRICE,Lipstick,"a soft pink with green-to-gold shifting shimmer. It had a fair amount of shimmer and slightly larger sparkles, so the there was more of a textural element to the bullet as it glided across my lips, but I would not say it was rough or uncomfortable‚Äìjust more like a ‚Äúhey, there‚Äôs some shimmer in this lipstick!‚Äù feeling. It was thinner and moderately emollient, and it lasted for only two hours on me. It seemed slightly moisturizing.",B-
NARS,MONTPARNASSE,Palette,"a warm gold and a medium, plummy brown. The left side was lovely‚Äìpigmented, easy to use, long-wearing‚Äìbut the right side had a disastrous texture: stiff, firm, and required jabbing and pushing to get powder to dislodge from the surface. Given the price point and that it only contains two shades, I couldn‚Äôt recommend this one.",B-
CLINIQUE,"HONEY, HONEY",Palette,"a simple set that includes two, miniature-sized Almonst Lipsticks in Pink Honey and Black Honey. The Almost Lipstick is described as having ‚Äútransparent pigment [that] merges with the unique, natural tone of your lips‚Äù with a ‚Äúsheer, glossy, emollient-rich, and very lightweight‚Äù formula. The description is fairly apt‚Äìenough pigmentation that they do alter the natural lip color but are still sheer that the natural lip color comes through. What I liked about the formula was that they still applied evenly and didn‚Äôt sink into my lip lines much while having decent wear (three hours) that was hydrating.",A-
KAT VON D,SUPER SONIC,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, coppery brown with warm, red undertones and flecks of green and gold sparkle. It had semi-opaque coverage in a single layer on its own, and it was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The texture was thin and felt watery going on, but it dried down to a transfer-resistant stain (but the product breaks down in water). The base definitely leaves a strong stain behind, even as the color wore away over a 10-hour period. The formula was a bit drying over time.",B-
ANASTASIA,HOLIDAY 2017,Palette,"three, miniature-sized liquid lipsticks with two shades being new and exclusive to the set. They performed in line with the brand‚Äôs more recently released liquid lipsticks‚Äìpigmented, long-wearing, a bit drying‚Äìso if you‚Äôve wanted to try the formula or typically enjoy it, the set is certainly worth considering as it offers a good amount of product for the price.",A-
BECCA COSMETICS,APRES SKI GLOW,Palette,"two blushes, one bronzer, and three highlighters. Two shades‚ÄìIcicle and Winter Berry‚Äìare new and exclusive to the palette, while the rest are available individually. I do not think that the quality of the powders in the palette is the same as the full-sized range; some perform worse but they felt different: drier, more papery. It‚Äôs always a shame when a brand changes up their formulas when they put them in a palette for the worse.",B-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,SASHA,Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with subtle, warm undertones and a natural finish. There was a very subtle pearl throughout the color but not enough to make it seem truly shimmery. It had nearly opaque coverage in a single layer, while the texture was lightweight, creamy without being heavy or thick, and comfortable to wear. There was slight color in my lip lines, though it did not seem noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The color lasted for four and a half hours and was hydrating.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,EMMA,Lipstick,"a deep, pinky-red with cool undertones and fine ruby red and pink pearl. The color payoff was semi-opaque with a lightweight, lightly creamy texture that felt emollient but not slippery on the lips. The lipstick sat well on the lips and despite the sheerness, the color went on evenly. It wore well for five hours and left a subtle stain behind, and the formula was moisturizing.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,INES,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark pinky-plum with subtle, warm undertones and a natural finish. It had good pigmentation‚Äìjust shy of full coverage‚Äìthat applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. The texture was lightweight, emollient without being too slippery on, and comfortable to wear. The color stayed on nicely for four and a half hours and felt hydrating.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,NAOMI,Lipstick,"a medium-dark red with fine, ruby red pearl and subtle, cool undertones. It had semi-opaque color coverage in a single layer. The lipstick was lightly creamy with some slip, but the color sat well on the lips and applied evenly. It wore well for four and a half hours and was moisturizing.",B+
PAT MCGRATH,MAJOR RED,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark red with cool, blue undertones and a cream finish. It had opaque pigmentation that drenched the lips in a single layer‚ÄìI don‚Äôt even think a full layer would be needed as it was so pigmented. The consistency was smooth, velvety, and dense enough to fill in lip lines yet managed to feel lighter weight and comfortable on the lips. The color was still going strong after 10 hours of wear‚Äìthe only difference was the shine had worn away by that point‚Äìbut that was after latte, water, and two meals. More incredibly, my lips felt hydrated after all that continuous wear. It just might be one of my new favorite reds.",A+
PAT MCGRATH,STRANGE,Lipstick,"a deep, reddish-brown with warm undertones and a cream finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a single stroke, which applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. It had a lightly emollient, creamy texture that wasn‚Äôt too slippery nor was it too firm in the tube, so it never dragged but didn‚Äôt feather or slide around when worn. It wore well for over eight hours on me and was moisturizing while worn.",A+
NARS,DEBAUCHED,Palette,"a warm plum and a blackened purple. The two have enough contrast in finish and depth to work well together for a very deep, smoky eye. Both shades applied well for me and were nicely pigmented!",A-
MAC,COLOURS ON THE VERGE,Palette,"a new, limited edition eyeshadow palette with five, shimmery shades ranging fro minty green to deep black.",B
MAKE UP FOR EVER,B306,Blush,"a slightly muted, medium coral-orange with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good pigmentation, which was buildable to full coverage with just a touch more product layered on top.",A
MAC,INDIMENTICABILE,Palette,"a coral-red, pink-red, and dark plum gloss housed in a small compact. Some love lip products in pans while others find they are more work than they‚Äôre worth, but I think the quality of the glosses was nice enough assuming tackiness is not a deal-breaker!",B+
MAC,MY MOON,Palette,"a shimmery, warm white and a deep, matt black. The textures of the two were a bit more dramatic in difference, so I did not find the matte black to go over the shimmery white as well as it could have. This was the result of the shimmery white being chunkier and flakier, so it did not have an even texture on the skin.",B-
MAC,NOSE POSE,Palette,"a highlighting/contouring duo, but of course, it‚Äôs very ‚Äúone-size‚Äù and will certainly not fit all or even most. The darker side seemed more like a bronzing color than a contouring one, though some with very warm complexions may prefer the warmth in the deeper shade for contouring. They can also be used on the eyes, as the formula is a multi-use one.",B+
URBAN DECAY,PSYCHO,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink-red with cool, blue undertones and faint, iridescent pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in a single layer, and a second layer could be applied to make it opaque. The consistency was thin, almost watery, but it applied evenly on the lips. After the liquid lipstick dried down, it appeared smooth and did not emphasize the lines on my lips. This shade lasted for seven hours but was somewhat drying after four hours of wear.",A-
URBAN DECAY,RAPID,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark red with cool undertones and a flat, matte finish. It had good color coverage in one layer, though one would need to apply a second one for full coverage. The liquid lipstick had a smooth, thin texture that wasn‚Äôt too watery or too heavy, so it was easy to maneuver across the lips and yielded even, smooth application of the color. The formula was fairly drying within five hours of wear, though it lasted for nearly eight on me.",B+
NARS,MUSE,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium gold with strong, warm yellow undertones and a sparkling finish. It had medium coverage with lots of shimmer in both fine and medium sizes. The gloss could have spread more evenly across the lips, and I did have trouble with a bit of the color sinking into my lip lines. It was certainly wearable on its own but may be better layered over another lip color. The consistency was light-medium in weight with some tackiness present. It lasted for four and a half hours on me but was hydrating.",B-
NARS,OFF LIMITS,Lipgloss,"a deep fuchsia with subtle, cool undertones and lighter fuchsia and pink sparkle. The gloss had nearly opaque coverage in a single layer, while the texture was smooth, light-medium in thickness, and moderately tacky but never felt heavy or goopy to me. It lasted for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A-
NARS,ZAMBEZE,Lipgloss,"a slightly muted, medium peachy brown with warm, orange undertones and a cream finish. It had great pigmentation in a single layer, and it applied fairly evenly without visible streaking, but there was color that seemed to pull around and sink into my lip lines. On me, the gloss stayed on well for four and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing.",B
NARS,KIKI,Lipgloss,"a dark, reddish burgundy with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage that applied decently, but it could have been more even, though it did not seem to pull into my lip lines as badly as a lot of these types of shades due when in a gloss formula. The consistency was light-medium in thickness with moderate tackiness, but I found it comfortable to wear over the five and a half hours it lasted for as it was on the hydrating side.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,B216,Blush,"a rich, medium magenta with cool undertones and a satin sheen. It was intensely pigmented and had a finish that looked more luminous as it was buffed onto the skin, though it was never shimmery. The blush had a smooth, moderately dense consistency that was surprisingly blendable for such an intense shade; it wasn‚Äôt effortless, but it wasn‚Äôt a struggle at all. The color stayed vibrant for nine hours on my skin.",A
MAC,ROSSY,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark purpled mauve with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had good pigmentation, though not opaque, that covered the lips with even coverage. The consistency was smooth, almost velvety, and glided across my lips without dragging. The color wore well for five hours and was neither drying nor hydrating, but I did find the color seemed to sink into my lip lines over time.",A-
MAC,PHENOMENAL WOMAN,Lipstick,"a deep, purpled burgundy with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied decently, but it could have gone on more evenly. The lipstick had a thin, moderately emollient feel, which likely contributed to some of the patchiness of the application as well as having color sink into my lip lines. This shade wore well for five and a half hours, left a slight stain behind, and was non-drying.",B-
MAC,SELF ESTEEM,Lipstick,"a medium red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had rich color payoff in a single layer, while the texture was velvety, thin but not clingy, and fairly comfortable to wear given it was still going strong after seven hours of wear. Overall, the formula seemed just a touch drying after wearing it for most of the day.",A
MAC,FRENESI,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark pink-red with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. It had good color coverage, though it was shy of opaque coverage, that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips without tugging. The texture was smooth without having much slip, so it adhered well and lasted for over seven hours on me and left a stain behind. It was a bit drying after five hours of wear, though.",A-
ANASTASIA,RADIANT,Palette,"a new, limited edition blush palette with four shades. There was nothing impressive about the formula as it was just too much work to blend out and nothing exceptional with respect to texture, pigmentation, or wear to justify spending three or four times longer blending out the blush, and the whole process is just worse over a base (like foundation) as you‚Äôll have to be particularly careful to avoid lifting and disturbing the base.",C+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,LARA,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, pink-coral with warm undertones and fine pearl. It had semi-sheer color coverage that applied evenly across the lips and did not emphasize my lip lines. The consistency was lightweight, lightly emollient but not overly slippery, so while it was comfortable to wear, it did last for a solid three hours. The formula felt lightly hydrating to me.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,ROMY,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark copper with warm, rosy undertones and a fine, gold and copper pearl finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a lightly emollient consistency that glided across the lips without tugging but had enough slip in it that there was a bit of product that gathered in my lip lines. I also struggled to get the color to adhere well to my inner lip area (particularly the lower lip, which you can see in the swatches). This shade stayed on well for three hours and was moisturizing.",B-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,B206,Blush,"a soft, light-medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It almost looked like strawberry ice cream‚Äìlighter but still quite pink. I did find that the shade darkened slightly on the skin after a few minutes, though.",A
ANASTASIA,SUGAR,Palette,"a new, limited edition powder highlighter set for the holidays. Three of the four shades‚Äìall but Gumdrop‚Äìare shades previously released, though Gumdrop has two similar shades from past releases that the kit itself is nothing new if you are a collector of the Glow Kits. If you like really intense highlighters and don‚Äôt mind some glitter, it might work for you, but if you prefer subtle highlighters and no glitter, this will be a miss.",B+
MAC,PINK DESIRE,Blush,"a vibrant, medium-dark fuchsia wit cool, blue undertones and a smattering of fine, fuchsia pearl. The finish was just barely shimmery, so it looked more luminous and satiny on the skin than overtly shimmery or frosted.",A
NARS,NOIRE ET BLANCHE,Palette,"four miniature-sized lipsticks with three of the four shades being new and one is a repeat from the permanent range (Charlotte). Three shades were quite pigmented and one was semi-opaque, and all four lasted for at least five hours on me and were no hardship to wear or to test. I noticed the texture of Charlotte and Josephine was thinner and less creamy compared to the Audacious formula on average.",A-
URBAN DECAY,FLASHBACK,Lipstick,"a medium purple with warm, pink undertones and a sparkling sheen. The consistency was lightweight, thin, and on the watery side, so it wasn‚Äôt much of a surprise when it did not apply evenly and some of the shimmer gathered more heavily in some areas than others. A second layer did not work well, due to the uneven initial layer, and there was a lot of flaking during wear if a second layer was applied. It had semi-sheer coverage that lasted for about five hours on me but was drying.",F
URBAN DECAY,UNBROKEN,Lipstick,"a deep plum with warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. This shade was unbearably drying; this one physically hurt to wear after four hours. The consistency was smooth going on, but it dried down to such a dry, chalky, and clingy way that it made my lips look like they had no moisture left (which was about how they felt in the end). It lasted for five hours on me before it had worn away unevenly from the center of my mouth.",D-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,B200,Blush,a very light pink with neutral-to-cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had a stronger white base but seemed to darken slightly five minutes after the initial application.,A
NARS,DOUBLE TAKE,Highlighter,"a medium gold with warm, orange undertones and a luminous sheen. It seemed more metallic initially but ended up applying with a softer finish that did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture.",A
MAC,RED ENVY,Blush,"a deep red with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was slightly firmer in the pan but did not feel overly stiff or difficult to pickup with a brush nor did the texture seem to make blending the color out too challenging. The richness of the color and intensity of the pigmentation (easily opaque!) made it take a bit longer to blend out the edges overall but in line with the better formulations I‚Äôve seen for this type of color. It wore well for nine hours on me before fading noticeably. Worth noting was that it tended to look pinky-red when worn at sheerer coverage levels and looked a bit warmer applied to my skin as a result of my warmer undertones.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,MONICA,Lipstick,"a muted, medium brown with warm, orange undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-sheer color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. The consistency was lightweight, creamy without being too slippery, and comfortable to wear. This shade lasted for three hours and was lightly hydrating while worn.",B-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,GRACE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium red with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly across the lips as the texture was lightly emollient, almost balm-like, but not too slippery, so the color sat well on the lips and looked very smooth. I thought the way this looked on the lips was particularly flattering, even if the shade was not as pigmented as described. On me, it wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing to me.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,DAKOTA,Lipstick,"a light-medium, cotton candy pink with cool, blue undertones and a soft, luminous sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied somewhat evenly but tended to streak along the edges and had color gather in my lip lines due to the overly emollient texture. The lipstick applied without dragging, but it was just too much on the slippery side to sit well on the lips nor did it last long (only three hours). The formula did feel lightly hydrating, though.",C+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,CAROLYN,Lipstick,"a medium, rosy copper with warm undertones and fine, multi-colored pearl (dominated by gold and copper, though). The consistency was smooth, lightweight, and emollient enough that it felt more like a lip balm as it glided across the lips with ease. It had semi-sheer coverage in a single layer, which was slightly buildable to medium coverage with a second layer. The lipstick lasted for four hours and was moisturizing.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,LISA,Lipstick,"a muted, medium copper with warm, gold and copper pearl. It had semi-sheer color payoff that applied fairly evenly, though the texture seemed to be thin compared to other shades and had less of a glossy finish as well. It glided across the lips without tugging despite not having as much slip. This shade wore well for two and a half hours and was hydrating.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,FABIOLA,Lipstick,"a muted, medium rosy brown with warm undertones and a natural sheen. The consistency was moderately emollient and felt a lot like the other Sheers in the range, but it had the color coverage and finish of the Ultra-Rich formula as it had nearly opaque coverage in a single layer. The lipstick lasted for four hours and was hydrating over time.",B
ANASTASIA,PRISM,Palette,"a mixed bag in terms of quality, though I think whether that is functionally true will depend on how you prefer to apply your eyeshadows. I had trouble with a few of the shimmery shades when it came to applying them with a dry brush (even over primer); a dampened brush or fingertip worked best for getting better coverage, more even application, and a more intense finish. If you‚Äôre someone who tends to use their shimmery eyeshadows wet already, then there‚Äôs no extra effort to worry about, but if you‚Äôre not, then really consider whether that‚Äôs something that you‚Äôd add to your routine.",B
URBAN DECAY,VANITY,Lipstick,"a deep, blackened purple with neutral-to-warm undertones and a smattering of multi-colored sparkle. It had semi-opaque color coverage in a single layer with a lightweight, thin texture that took quite awhile to dry down. Even when it seemed transfer-resistant, it did not have the same flat, matte finish or appearance as other shades in the formula have had. It did not apply evenly, particularly along the center of my mouth, and had a tendency to sit and pull away at my lip lines. It wore well for six and a half hours but had some flakiness over time, while the formula itself was somewhat drying.",C
TOO FACED,PINCH MY PEACH,Blush,"muted, medium coral with warm, orange undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had medium coverage, which was hard to build up without the texture becoming thicker, powdery, and almost caked onto the skin.",F
BOBBI BROWN,BOBBI TO GLOW,Palette,"a new, limited edition set for the holidays that contains three, nearly full-sized highlighting powders. The brand described them as a trio of ‚Äúbestselling‚Äù shades, but they did not line up that closely with past releases with similar names, so they seemed new-to-me. I enjoy this formula as it has a smooth and blendable consistency without any powderiness that is easy to apply to the skin and yields a gorgeous, glowing finish. All three shades were consistent with past shades I‚Äôve tried in the formula, and I think if one likes warmer-toned highlighters, it‚Äôs certainly worth considering.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,VALENTINA,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark pink with subtle, warm undertones and fine pink pearl. It had medium color coverage that was buildable to semi-opaque coverage, but it was not what I would consider to be ‚Äúultra-rich.‚Äù The texture was moderately emollient and had more slip than other shades‚Äìmore of a cross between the Sheer and Ultra-Rich formulations. The lipstick applied evenly and smoothly across the lips without settling into my lip lines, and it had the effect of a stain due to the translucency. It wore well for four hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,KYRA,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, plummy brown with warm undertones and a luminous finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage in a single layer with a smooth, lightly creamy consistency that wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin, so it sat well on the lips and was comfortable to wear. The lipstick lasted well for five hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,ASHLEY,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, raspberry pink with subtle, cool undertones and a luminous sheen. There was very fine pearl strewn throughout the color but so fine that it did not appear frosted or metallic. It had good color coverage that was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The texture was smooth, lightly creamy, and comfortable to wear without being too slippery. It wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A-
FENTY BEAUTY,STARSTRUCK,Highlighter,"a light, pinky beige with warmer undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. It had good pigmentation, which was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The texture was thin, more powder-like than cream as soon as product was put onto a fingertip or a brush. I liked applying it better with a fingertip, as I felt the warmth was needed to blend out the product on my skin to avoid disturbing base products or getting a patchy look. There was noticeable sparkle to this shade, and it could emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture slightly if I was not careful. On me, it wore well for eight hours.",B
FENTY BEAUTY,SINAMON,Highlighter,"a muted, medium-dark copper with warm, brown undertones and a pearly sheen. The texture seemed lightly creamy initially but seemed to get drier the longer I owned the product, which made it harder to blend out on the skin without it looking slightly uneven, almost patchy. It had opaque coverage, and it was possible to diffuse (or apply less) to get less coverage. The color lasted for seven and a half hours on me.",B
LAURA MERCIER,MODE TO MODERN,Palette,"a new, limited edition set featuring four, miniature-sized jumbo eyeshadow pencils. All four shades can be purchased individually if that is preferred. The Caviar Stick formula is supposed to have ‚Äúeasy application with ‚Äúlong-lasting color‚Äù that ‚Äúblends and layers beautifully onto the lids with rich pigment-payoff.‚Äù This year‚Äôs set includes two matte shades and two shimmers. All our shades were richly pigmented and long-wearing with textures being creamy and non-tugging.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,LILY,Lipstick,"a light, silvery white with cool undertones and a fine pearl finish. It had semi-sheer, buildable color coverage (up to medium coverage) with a lightly creamy, thin, and emollient texture. The color went on somewhat evenly but was prone to settling into my lip lines. It lasted for two and a half hours but was hydrating over time.",C
TOM FORD BEAUTY,LENA,Lipstick,"a pale, light blue with gold, blue, and green pearl. It had semi-sheer coverage with lots of shimmer; it seemed to lighten and cool down my natural lip color while adding a multi-dimensiona shimmer that reflected light beautifully. The consistency was lightweight, emollient, and comfortable to wear as it was moisturizing over the two and a half hours it wore well for.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,CARINE,Lipstick,"a light-medium, peachy gold with warm, orange undertones and fine, golden pearl. It had semi-sheer to medium color payoff in a single stroke with a moderately emollient consistency that was a bit thin but felt rather balm-like, so it was comfortable on the lips. There was slight color that pulled into my lip lines, and it only lasted for two hours on me.",B-
COLOUR POP,MY LITTLE PONY,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette with 12 shades in a variety of hues. The palette felt a bit divided between warmer tones of pink and orange and cooler tones of silver and teal. The color combination is fun and makes one have to get creative in pairing shades together. I wish the quality of each shade was higher, though, as there were two real misses in the palette. For the price point, it wouldn‚Äôt make me steer clear, but I know ColourPop can do better!",B
COLOUR POP,LEMON DROP,Lipstick,"a medium-dark lavender purple with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage in a single layer that applied evenly across the lips. The liquid lipstick was smooth, thin, and spreadable over my lips, but it was slightly uneven when I looked in the close-up photos, though I did not notice any unevenness in person. It wore well for six hours and was non-drying.",A-
COLOUR POP,MOONDANCER,Lipstick,"a deep plum with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had good color payoff in a single layer, though it was not opaque. The consistency was fluid, almost too runny, and smooth, which made it comfortable to apply and easy to spread out (that‚Äôs where it seemed to be almost too runny‚Äìit was too spreadable!). There was a bit of color that dried down in my lip lines. On me, the color was still going strong after six hours of wear but had started to feel a bit drying after four horus of wear.",B+
COLOUR POP,PIN WHEEL,Lipstick,"a deep fuchsia with cool, blue undertones and a flat, matte finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque in a single layer. It had a thin, fluid consistency that was smooth but almost too fluid, as it made it harder to control around the edges of the mouth. It dried down fairly quickly and felt clingier compared to the other shades. It was still going strong after six hours of wear but was moderately drying to wear.",B+
STILA,EYE FOR ELEGANCE,Palette,"six liquid eyeshadows‚Äìthree with a shimmer finish and three with a glitter finish. I was pleasantly surprised by the color payoff, ease of application, and wear of the Shimmer & Glow formula. The Glitter & Glow shades performed much like past shades have in the same formula, which is to say largely dependent on the strength of the base color against the size of the sparkles, though for anyone who is after a glitter eyeshadow for layering, I imagine they are nice enough.",A-
COLOUR POP,CHERRIES JUBILEE,Eyeshadow,"a pale white with a pinkish tone and pink and lavender sparkle. It had good pigmentation in a single layer with a smooth, lightly sparkly texture. The consistency was slightly thinner, and the sparkles did not spread as evenly as I would have liked them to have (they seemed to bunch up a bit unless patted on and not blended/moved at all). This shade wore well for nine hours and had minor fallout.",B
COLOUR POP,POSEY,Eyeshadow,"a light peach with warm, yellowish undertones and pink, beige, and silver sparkle. It had semi-sheer color coverage, which wasn‚Äôt buildable, and it worked best layered over another product (like eyeliner or opaque eyeshadow) to add sparkle. The consistency was soft, smooth, and creamy enough to still feel like a cream eyeshadow but it looked and set more like a powder eyeshadow, but it was hard to spread the glittery bits evenly. There was some fallout over the nine hours it lasted for.",C+
COLOUR POP,SUNBEAM,Eyeshadow,"a medium purple with cool undertones and flecks of blue and violet sparkle. It had semi-sheer coverage, and again, it was the type of coverage and finish that worked best layered over another product to transform the tone (it looked great over black eyeliner). I found this one easier to work with as the sparkle/glitter spread more evenly on the skin. It wore well for nine hours and had minor fallout.",C+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,LOULOU,Lipstick,"a bright, medium fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a lightly creamy texture that wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin. It was hydrating over time but had a tendency to pull into my lip lines. This shade wore well for four and a half hours and left a slight stain behind.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,VIOLET,Lipstick,"a light-medium, pinky lavender with warm undertones and a cream sheen. It had nearly opaque color coverage in a single layer with a moderately creamy consistency that had noticeable slip. It could have applied a bit more evenly along the edges, and it showed ‚Äúlines‚Äù whenever I pressed my lips together with some minor settling into my lip lines over time. The color lasted for four hours on me and was lightly moisturizing.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,GEORGIE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, reddish berry with subtle, cool undertones and violet pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation‚Äìdefinitely not ‚Äúultra-rich‚Äù!‚Äìwith a moderately emollient consistency that felt more like a cross between the Sheer and Ultra-Rich formulas. The lipstick applied easily and went on evenly with a lightweight, balm-like feel that was moisturizing over the four and a half hours this shade wore for.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,LUSTROUS,Palette,"12 eyeshadows in a mix of mattes and shimmers (actually, only three shimmers, which is a big deal for the brand‚Äôs pre-made palettes!). It‚Äôs new and limited edition for the holiday season, and as I noted in my sneak peek post, the brand made several mentions of the formula being new: ‚Äúnewest innovation‚Äù and ‚Äúunique formula‚Äù and ‚Äúformulated with 25 percent more pigment‚Äù and ‚Äúbe the first to try this new formula.‚Äù Reading through ingredient lists, the ingredient lists for M100 (matte black) and ME512 (gold) differed enough that it did seem like a new formula. I received confirmation via email from Make Up For Ever that the palette does feature a new formula that we will see in the future but no other details were shared at this time.",B
FENTY BEAUTY,RIDIIIC,Highlighter,"a rich, tomato red with warm, orange undertones and flecks of golden pearl strewn throughout the color. It had opaque pigmentation in a single layer, and the pigmentation was high enough where even just a dab was plenty of product to diffuse for a stain-like color on the cheeks. Despite having a powder-like dry down on the skin, it looked dewy due to the sheen from the shimmer. The formula was smooth, thin, but creamy enough that I was able to apply and blend out the blush with ease on my skin, even over foundation. This shade stayed on well for nine hours.",A+
URBAN DECAY,COMEBACK,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, rosy mauve with neutral-to-warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. It had opaque color payoff in a single layer, which dried down quickly and did not pull apart at my lip lines. I was surprised at how smooth after it dried down, as it felt very dry and almost chalky to me. The texture was thin but spreadable, but the dry down made it feel clingy. It lasted for five hours but had noticeable flakiness after three hours of wear. The formula was drying on me.",C+
URBAN DECAY,KINKY,Lipstick,"a medium, peachy coral with warm, orange undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation, though it would take a second layer for full coverage. The consistency was thin, watery, and difficult to apply evenly to the lips, even after I waited for the dry down‚Äìthere were noticeable patchiness and visible streakiness. On me, the lipstick color stayed on well for five hours but faded strongly away from the center, while the formula was fairly drying.",C-
CIATE,SOLSTICE,Highlighter,"a pale pink with a frosted sheen that shifted from cooler lavender to warmer pink. The shimmer was larger in the highlighter, and I felt like it made it more prone to emphasizing my skin‚Äôs natural texture as a result. When diffused and blended out to medium coverage, I did not find it noticeably accentuating, though. It had good pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage with a second layer.",B+
COLOUR POP,I THINK I LOVE YOU,Palette,"12 eyeshadows in warmer, neutral hues, plus a deep black, in a variety of finishes, though the palette runs frosted-to-metallic overall. I think the color story of this palette isn‚Äôt quite as versatile as other pre-made palettes from the brand, but the performance was still good overall with a few shades having a bit of fallout or weren‚Äôt quite as pigmented as the rest.",B+
FENTY BEAUTY,BLONDE,Highlighter,"a medium, yellow gold with warm undertones and a fine, pearly sheen. It had more pearl than base color, so as I blended out the color, it looked more shimmery than yellow. It had semi-opaque, buildable coverage overall. The consistency was thin, just barely creamy, and it definitely applied best with fingertips as the warmth helped keep the product blendable and malleable on the skin. On me, it wore well for eight hours.",B+
CIATE,RAINBOW,Highlighter,"a pale, silvery white with a luminous sheen. The strips of colors are rather thin, so it wasn‚Äôt really pratical to use them individually, and when I attempted to get more of a gradient, they just all seemed to wash together regardless to a single shade (silvery white).",A-
FENTY BEAUTY,CHILI MANGO,Highlighter,"an intense, medium orange with warm, yellow undertones and a fine, golden pearl. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, and I felt like a little went a long way if applied directly from the tube, but applying with my fingertips (which was how I applied the formula across shades) made it easy to blend, diffuse, and sheer out the coverage as desired. The consistency was smooth, creamy without being too thick or too thin, and it was easy to apply to my skin. It wore well for nine hours on me before fading slightly.",A+
TARTE,BLUSH BLISS,Palette,"four shades of warmer-toned blushes‚Äìtwo peach/corals and two pink-based shades. The palette had two really lovely blushes while the other two were less pigmented and shorter wearing, so it was a bit of a mixed bag. I imagine if one doesn‚Äôt mind more buildable coverage (while simultaneously enjoying pigmented blush!), then the downsides won‚Äôt be deal-breakers. I wish there was more differentiation between the shades, since there are only four; it would have nicer to see perhaps a mid-tone coral, deep copper-brown, muted plum, and a vibrant pink.",B
MAC,UNDER THE SHEETS,Lipgloss,"a light peach with warm undertones and lots of multi-colored pearl. It had medium coverage with a high-gloss finish and enough pearl that it distracted from the color that pulled into my lip lines when vieewed at a normal distance. The gloss was light-medium in weight with a sticky feel, but it was also smooth, moisturizing, and comfortable to wear. On me, it lasted for four hours.",B-
MAC,NUDE,Lipgloss,"a medium peach with fine gold and pink pearl. It had medium coverage that did not appear streaky when applied but definitely settled into my lip lines. The consistency was smooth, light-medium in weight, and moderately tacky, which helped it last longer (four hours) but is a tackier formula compared to most modern glosses. The formula was comfortable to wear and lightly hydrating over time.",B-
CIATE,CELESTIAL,Highlighter,"a medium-dark gold with warm, orange undertones and a frosted, sparkling finish. The consistency was soft, a little dry in the pan, and did not bind as well when I applied and blended out the powder on my skin. I felt like the shimmer particles were larger and definitely were more prone to emphasizing my skin‚Äôs natural texture compared to the brand‚Äôs initial releases in this formula, though it certainly wasn‚Äôt the worst offender in that department and only when worn at semi-opaque or greater coverage. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The highlighter stayed on well for eight hours on me.",B
BURBERRY,HOLIDAY 2017,Palette,"four, miniature-sized liquid lipsticks. I‚Äôm a huge fan of the formula‚Äìit‚Äôs pigmented, long-wearing, and comfortable to wear. The ‚Äúdownside‚Äù is the brand claims they last for eight hours, and they tend to last between six and eight hours on average. I found the formula of the shades included in the set to be consistent with their full-sized counterparts that I‚Äôve reviewed in the past (so I did not retest for wear time but ratings reflect the set‚Äôs versions for pigmentation, texture, and so forth). Keep in mind, the formula does not have a flat, matte dry down‚Äìthey have a light sheen that wears down to a satin-to-matte finish after a few hours of wear.",A-
MAC,PRETTY PLEASE,Lipstick,"a pale, light pink with an icier base and warmer golden pearl. It had sheer color payoff, which was not buildable but was more in line with the Lustre finish (always sheerer). The texture was emollient going on but felt thin and was prone to getting into my lip lines. It wore well for two hours on me and was slightly drying.",C
MAC,THE RIGHT NOTE,Lipstick,"a medium, peachy brown with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered the lips evenly and smoothly with just a smidgen of color getting into my deepest lip line. The consistency was lightweight, emollient without being too slippery as there was a bit of tackiness to the finish. This shade wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing.",A-
MAC,STRIPPED,Lipstick,"a slightly muted, medium peach with warm, beige undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had good pigmentation, but the color could have applied more evenly, while the texture could have sat better on the lips‚Äìit was prone to getting into my pesky lip lines. On me, the lipstick stayed on well for four and a half hours but was a touch drying.",B-
TARTE,GODDESS GLOW,Highlighter,"a medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a sparkling sheen. This has noticeable sparkle to it, so if you are not a fan of more glittery highlighters, then this is most definitely not going to work for you. On the other hand, if the more sparkle the better in your book, then perhaps you‚Äôll enjoy the finish.",B-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,THE WILD ONE,Palette,"20 eyeshadows housed in an oversized compact (it was actually harder to open than I expected due to the way the clasp and palette are sized!). Overall, there were a lot of good shades in the palette, and the only real dud was a glittery shade that needs an adhesive/tacky base to work well (not at all a surprise). I liked how the color combination wasn‚Äôt the typical one we have seen in palettes, so it made it fun to use and encouraged creativity when I attempted to stay within the palette for looks.",B+
MAC,MMMMMM,Lipstick,"a medium, pinky mauve with neutral-to-warm undertones and a lightly glossy finish. It had rich pigmentation that applied even, opaque coverage in a single layer. The lipstick was lightly creamy with a smooth, lightweight texture that glided across my lips easily. The color stayed on well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",A-
MAC,PATISSERIE,Lipstick,"a soft, light-medium pink with strong, warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-sheer to medium coverage, which was as expected given its Lustre finish. The consistency had moderate slip, so it felt slippery on the lips and while comfortable, did not last long‚Äìit was mostly gone by the two and a half hour mark. The formula felt a bit drying on me.",B-
MAC,PLAYING KOI,Lipstick,"a bright pink with warm, yellow undertones and a satin finish. It had a stronger white base that came through and made it look almost chalky to my eye, which may make it harder to wear for some complexions. The consistency was smooth, lightweight, and just creamy enough to glide across the lips without dragging but was still a bit firmer than the average MAC lipstick. It had nearly opaque coverage that went on more evenly than anticipated, though there was a touch of color that gathered in my lip lines. It lasted for four hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B
BECCA COSMETICS,MOONSTONE,Highlighter,"a light gold with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. The color seemed ever-so-slightly lighter and yellower compared to my full-sized version. It had excellent pigmentation with a soft, blendable consistency that did not feel quite as cream-like as the full-sized version of Moonstone, but from a functional perspective, it did not matter. I felt that the mini applied and lasted just as well as the full-sized. It lasted for eight and a half hours on me before fading slightly.",A
LORAC,MEGA PRO 4,Palette,"a whopping 32 eyeshadows housed in a slim, cardobard palette. There were some nicer shades in the palette but plenty of so-so ones and a few total misses. I tend to find that with the exception of the original Pro palettes (so mostly the Mega Pros), the formula runs more powdery/dusty and thin that it just rarely performs impressively on bare skin (which is how I test other powder eyeshadows). I did try working with the palette and some of the weaker shades over LORAC‚Äôs own primer, and they were somewhat better‚Äìmaybe 10-15% improvement‚Äìbut nothing I‚Äôd want to reach for again willingly myself, even with the help of primer. The eyeshadows just didn‚Äôt come together as well as they could have, and even the richer shades had a tendency to look more muted on the lid than in the pan over primer. It‚Äôs not the worst palette I‚Äôve ever used, but LORAC has and could do better.",C+
MAC,BOSOM FRIEND,Lipstick,"a light pink with subtle, warm undertones and a soft sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which was slightly less than expected given its Cremesheen finish. The texture was lightly creamy with a touch of tackiness that never felt heavy or overly slippery on the lips, but it was comfortable to wear and didn‚Äôt drag when applied directly from the tube. There was a bit of color that gathered in my lip lines over time but the coverage was rather even, which was a huge plus given how pale the shade itself was. The lipstick lasted for three and a half hours on me and was not drying.",B
MAC,CR√®ME D'NUDE,Lipstick,"a light, peachy beige with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque color coverage in a single layer with a lightweight, lightly emollient texture that glided across the lips without tugging. The color applied fairly evenly, though there was a bit of product that got into my lip lines initially as well as more over time. It stayed on well for three and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B
MAC,DERRIERE,Lipstick,"a dark brown with warm, caramel undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single stroke, which was buildable to full coverage with just a bit more on top. The consistency was smooth, velvet, and lightly creamy without being too slippery or thick on the lips. On me, it wore well for five hours with a bit of color settling over time and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
BECCA COSMETICS,ROSE GOLD,Highlighter,"a medium, rosy copper with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, but the soft, blendable consistency made it easy to apply less or more depending on one‚Äôs preferences. The powder blended out nicely along the edges and stopped just short of emphasizing my skin‚Äôs natural texture. The texture of this shade was a bit drier and looser compared to the full-sized version I have and was also a bit drier and looser even compared to the other minis, though it really did not seem to impact the application or wear, as it still lasted for eight and a half hours on me.",A-
BECCA COSMETICS,OPAL,Highlighter,"a muted, medium gold with warm undertones and a metallic finish. It was richly pigmented with a soft, blendable consistency that was slightly looser in the pan compared to the permanent, full-sized version I have from years ago (which also felt creamier). On the skin, they looked and performed the same‚Äìhigh-shine, intense highlighters that blended out easily and lasted for eight and a half hours.",A
STILA,WRITTEN IN THE STARS,Palette,"three, miniature-sized glitter-tastic liquid eyeshadows (they‚Äôre about half the size of a full-sized shade). All three are also available individually in the permanent line-up, and the three here were fairly consistent with my full-sized versions; to manage the holiday deluge, I did not re-test these for wear. I love that the brand put out a set of these, as cream/liquid products typically expire faster than powders, so it can be hard to justify or partake in lots of shades at full-sized quantities and have any hope of finishing one. The three shades included seem to be good, more ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù kind of shades, though they will be best for layering over other base colors or spread over the lid as an all-over wash of glitter. I really enjoy the effect of this formula for layering, but if you‚Äôre after them as a standalone product, you may be less enamored with them.",B
KAT VON D,SAINT + SINNER,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette for the holidays. It‚Äôs a large palette that features 24 eyeshadows split into two families‚ÄìSaint (‚Äúwearable, romantic‚Äù hues) and Sinner (‚Äúbold color pops‚Äù)‚Äìto mimic the look of stained glass windows. The larger size of it made it feel bulky and felt less travel-friendly, and I know that the seemingly jumbled shade arrangement has made it look less cohesive to some, but I‚Äôll say that after creating looks with it, I think the shades do come together. I think that it is a little heavier on the warm-toned side of things and could have used at least one or two cooler/more mid-tone transition type of shades, but I didn‚Äôt feel like I was at a loss for creating combinations with it.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,HOLIDAY 2017,Palette,"four, miniature-sized liquid lipsticks from Bite. All four shades are available individually in the permanent line. The set‚Äôs versions felt consistent to me compared to the permanent versions, which I reviewed earlier this year when they initially debuted, so for the purposes of the review, I did not re-test for wear time but did go through things like pigmentation, texture, and so forth solely based on the set‚Äôs versions. I think it‚Äôs an excellent holiday set for someone in the market for Bite‚Äôs liquid lipstick‚Äìjust do keep in mind that they are not a matte, dry-down kind of formula; they are liteally a liquid version of a traditional lipstick.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,CAT'S MEOW,Palette,"a new, limited edition set of five, miniature-sized lipsticks (just less than half the size of a full-sized shade). Each shade is part of the permanent range, so they can be purchased individually at any time as well. They come inside a zippered, rectangular-shaped container with a pink leopard print design. The big downside to the set is that the brand makes a very industrious claim of 10-hours for wear, which none of the lipsticks lived up to (and that is consistent with my past experience in using this formula), so that dropped the ratings quite a bit.",C+
BITE BEAUTY,SPICED PLUM,Lipstick,"a deep, reddish plum with warmer undertones and flecks of fuchsia, deep pink, and copper pearl and a few larger sparkles. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that went on fairly evenly but settled into my lip lines noticeably.",B-
BECCA COSMETICS,APRES SKI GLOW COLLECTION,Palette,"seven eyeshadows inspired by the brand‚Äôs famous powder highlighters, just designed ‚Äúspecifically for the eyes.‚Äù I think that one of the strengths of Becca‚Äôs Shimmering Skin Perfector Pressed highlighters is their texture‚Äìthat creamy, smooth, and velvety-feel that is almost effortless when it comes to blending and diffusing on the skin. That doesn‚Äôt exist in this palette; the textures are dry, powdery, and prone to sheering out. The eyeshadows only adhered decently to the lid with a dampened brush but were barely-there washes when I attempted to use them dry. When I tried using them dry over eyeshadow primer, they were still miserable to work with.",D-
BITE BEAUTY,HOLIDAY 2017,Palette,"a limited edition, holiday gift set that features four, miniature-sized (about a third of a full-sized shade) Amuse Bouche Lipsticks housed in a ruby red, metallic tin. Long-time Bite fans may find that this set is too redundant compared to past years‚Äô sets, though for those who are newer to the brand and/or formula, the set is a great way to try out the formula at a great price (less than the cost of one shade!). I definitely would love to see Bite explore more mini sets; like a cooler-toned set, warmer-toned set, or maybe by color family like a berry set, neutral set, and red set. The shades here were fairly consistent with their permanent counterparts, though I found Honeycomb to be ever-so-slightly less warm-toned.",A-
COVER FX,HOLIDAY 2017,Palette,"four, miniature-sized liquid highlighters. All four shades are available individually, but the set is an excellent way to enjoy the liquid highlighter formula without committing to the higher price tag for a single shade. Plus, as a liquid-based formula, they just won‚Äôt last as long as a powder one, so the smaller sizes means finishing them has a higher possibility!",A
MAC,THE PINKPRINT,Lipstick,"a soft, light-medium pink with warmer undertones and a natural sheen. The pigmentation was nearly opaque in a single layer. It seemed to have more slip than most Amplifieds, which made it appear a touch streaky along the edges and more prone to settling in my lip lines. The texture was comfortable to wear as the creamy quality helped it glide on without tugging. It wore well for four hours but settled further into my lip lines. The formula felt lightly moisturizing while worn.",B
MAC,NICKI'S NUDE,Lipstick,"a soft, medium pink coral with warm undertones and a satin sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a lightweight, creamy texture that wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin on the lips. The color glided on with ease and lasted for four and a half hours while being just a touch hydrating.",A-
URBAN DECAY,LITTLE VICES,Palette,"five travel-sized lipsticks with two exclusive shades (Double Crossed and Mad) and one just-released shade (Love Drunk). The three shades that have been released before were consistent with their full-sized versions. Mad was the weakest in the set, as it was sheer and patchier, and would be most suitable for use as a layering shade as a result. I liked the set overall and think that if the shades appeal, but the Metallized shades still under-performed (consistent with the permanent line).",B+
FENTY BEAUTY,GINGER BINGE/MOSCOW MULE,Palette,"contains two rose golds‚Äìone lighter, one deeper‚Äìand both are quite shimmery with high-shine finishes. This duo will be most suitable for someone who likes richer, more pigmented highlighters with metallic to glittery finishes and isn‚Äôt concerned when highlighters accentuate the skin‚Äôs natural texture. I felt the quality of the left side of the duo was better than the other duos.",B+
FENTY BEAUTY,YACHT LIFE,Highlighter,"a vibrant, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a golden sheen. It had medium coverage that was buildable to opaque coverage with two layers. The shimmer seemed to be finer in this particular shade than others, and I felt like this helped it apply more evenly and sit better on the skin (with or without a base). It gave a luminous glow that was moderate in intensity but not accentuating of my skin‚Äôs natural texture.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,B110,Blush,"a very light peach with a stronger, white base paired with a satin finish. There was a subtle sheen to the powder as I applied and blended it on the skin, though it did not look shimmery. The texture was soft, smooth, and blendable, while it felt denser in the pan so using a more moderate hand or denser brush would be key (I would not describe the powder as stiff, though!). It had opaque pigmentation in a single layer, and I did feel like the color darkened slightly after I applied it to my skin (if you have drier skin, it might not darken as noticeably). This shade wore well for eight hours before fading noticeably.",B+
FENTY BEAUTY,TRIPPIN,Highlighter,"a medium, peachy coral with warm, yellow gold frosted shimmer. It had semi-sheer coverage that was buildable to semi-opaque coverage in two to three layers. At three layers, it did emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture and seemed to be more prone to lifting and pushing around foundation.",B
FENTY BEAUTY,METAL MOON,Highlighter,"a very pale white with warmer undertones and warm, golden pearl. It had the most subtle sheen out of all the currently available shades in the formula‚Äìmore of a soft sheen than overt or over-the-top highlighter with very fine shimmer and no glitter/sparkle.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,CHAMPAGNE DISCOVERY,Palette,"a lipgloss, lip pencil, and a multi-use cream stick (can be used on eyes, lips, and cheeks). All three shades are part of the brand‚Äôs permanent offerings, so they can be purchased individually as well. They are full-sized products, so the set has a great value at $65 worth of products.",B+
URBAN DECAY,HAWKEYE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark green with subtle, warm undertones and cooler, emerald green pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered the lips without tugging on them, but the color itself could have applied more evenly. The texture was thin but moderately emollient, which helped it apply without pulling on the lips, but it did not help keep the color in place. This shade wore well for four and a half hours but was prone to color getting in my deeper lip lines over time. It felt moisturizing while I wore it.",C+
URBAN DECAY,VOODOO,Lipstick,"a rich, medium blue with cool undertones and a glossy, creamy finish. Surprisingly, for as slippery and creamy the consistency was, it went on a lot better than I expected. There was still room for improvement‚Äìit wasn‚Äôt fully even and was prone to settling in lip lines‚Äìbut still, I expected it to be a disaster based on the emollient texture. It had good pigmentation that stayed on for five hours and left a slight stain behind, while the formula was lightly hydrating.",B
FENTY BEAUTY,MEAN MONEY/HU$TLA BABY,Palette,"a light, pearly gold and a brighter, peachy gold with a metallic finish. The right side was an intense highlighter but did accentuate the look of my skin‚Äôs texture, which may be a deal breaker for some‚Äìdefinitely not ‚Äúsuperfine shimmer‚Äù as described. The left side was subtle but also quite sheer with a less forgiving texture for ease of use.",C+
TOO FACED,PEACH BERRY,Blush,"a muted, medium plum with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had medium coverage that was buildable to semi-paque pigmentation in two to three layers.",D-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,B210,Blush,"a vibrant, medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and a satiny sheen. It had ultra-fine shimmer that gave it a soft glow on the skin but did not look overtly shimmery and definitely not metallic once applied. The consistency was soft, smooth, and not quite as dense as most shades in the range. It had rich, opaque color payoff in a single layer, and thankfully, it was easy to blend out along the edges for a diffused gradient of color. The blush wore well for eight and a half hours on me before fading slightly.",A
TOO FACED,FRESHLY BAKED,Lipstick,"a slightly muted, medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. It had opaque pigmentation in a single layer with a fluid, smooth consistency that was easy to spread across the lips for even coverage and crisp lines. The downside was the dry down was intensely matte‚Äìit cracked around my lip lines and looked dry, clingy while feeling uncomfortably dry on. It lasted for four and a half hours and had some flakes that came away after a meal, but it was quite drying.",C+
TOO FACED,HAPPY FACE,Highlighter,"a light, yellowed gold with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-sheer pigmentation that was buildable to medium coverage on the skin.",C-
URBAN DECAY,ROACH,Lipstick,"a deep bronze with warm undertones and fine gold, pink, and bronze pearl. It had good color coverage, though it was not quite opaque. I felt like this version had a bit less shimmer compared to the limited edition version I reviewed previously. The consistency was lightly creamy, comfortable to wear and to apply, and sat fairly well on my lips, though there was a bit of color that sank into my deeper lip lines over time. It wore for just over four and a half hours on me but was moisturizing while worn.",B+
URBAN DECAY,LOVE DRUNK,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark plum with warm undertones and lots of greenish-gold pearl. It had nearly opaque pigmentation, and it applied evenly and smoothly on my lips, which made it one of the better Metallized shades that I‚Äôve tried. The texture was lightweight with moderate slip, but there was a touch of tackiness that helped keep it in place over time. On me, the color wore well for five hours and was hydrating over time.",A+
URBAN DECAY,HIDEAWAY,Lipstick,"a muted, medium pinky mauve with neutral-to-cool undertones and a satin sheen. It had opaque color coverage in a single layer, and the color applied evenly across the lips. The texture was lightweight, velvety, and cream, so it glided on without tugging on the lips and felt comfortable to wear. There was slight color in my deeper lip lines after five hours of wear, though the formula felt lightly hydrating and had enough slip that I could smooth out the color by pressing my lips together.",A
URBAN DECAY,BACKSEAT,Lipstick,"a medium, orange-leaning coral with warm undertones and a fine, golden pearl strewn through it but not enough of it to make it appear shimmery or metallic. It had a ‚ÄúSheer‚Äù finish, so the medium coverage it yielded was no surprise, and thankfully, the color applied evenly and did not appear streaky. More impressively, very little pulled into my lip lines, and overall, I felt like the finish/texture of the lipstick made my lips appear smoother and softer. On me, the lipstick wore well for four hours and was hydrating over time.",A
CIATE,CANDY,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium pink with neutral-to-warm undertones and a faint, pink sparkle. It had semi-opaque color coverage in a single layer, which went on evenly for the most part with a bit of color separating at my deeper lip lines. This was the least transformative/least sparkly shade in the range and went from more like a satin finish to a faintly glittery one after pressing my lips together. It was easier to apply from the tube as it did not seem quite as fluid as a lot of shades in the range were. It was medium in weight, somewhat clingy, and lightly drying after four and a half hours of wear.",B-
CIATE,INFAMOUS,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark, pinky plum with warmer undertones and a slightly, sparkling finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentatoin that applied fairly evenly, though it was a bit patchy after it dried down along my upper lip as color lifted when I pressed my lips together to reveal the glitter. There was some glitter that was exposed by pressing my lips together, but this was one of the less transformative shades in the range. It was, however, more comfortable to wear than others, as it felt a bit lighter on the lips. This shade lasted for four and a half hours and was lightly drying.",B-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,S300,Blush,"a light-medium peach with warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. It seemed more like a true peach to me‚Äìa little pink, a little orange but neither dominating. I could see it leaning cooler or warmer depending on one‚Äôs undertones. It had excellent pigmentation that applied well to bare skin, sat on the skin naturally and never looked dry, and was easy to blend out and diffuse along the edges. The texture was soft, smooth, and blendable with a slightly denser texture overall, but I had no trouble picking up product with a typical blush brush. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,FRIVOLUXE,Palette,"an assortment of pale peach, mauve, violet, purple, and taupe. I think the color combination was rather unique relative to most palettes, so I really was quite disappointed by its performance, though I was not entirely surprised, given grays and purples are often hard to do well. The palette was workable but lacked pigmentation in some shades with inconsistent textures with one being exceptionally stiff and others being smooth and silky.",C
URBAN DECAY,ASPHYXIA,Lipstick,"a medium, lavender purple with warm, pink undertones and cooler blue, silver, and icy violet pearl. It read more iridescent than a true duochrome to me with just a slight shift from bluish purple to warmer purple if I caught it at the right angle. It‚Äôs part of the ‚ÄúCream‚Äù finish, and the downside was it just was not as opaque as it was supposed to be, though I felt this version (as it was released previously as a limited edition shade) had slightly more grip and tackiness with more body overall, which gave it slightly better payoff. It had semi-opaque coverage that was somewhat buildable with a smooth, lightly creamy texture that sat fairly well on the lips. It wore well for four and a half hours and was hydrating.",B+
URBAN DECAY,BACKFIRE,Lipstick,"a dark purple with warm undertones and fine multi-colored pearl. It‚Äôs supposed to have a ‚ÄúCream‚Äù finish, which would make it opaque, and it had more semi-opaque coverage. The texture was smooth, lightly creamy, and had a light tackiness that helped it wear longer (five and a half hours), but it did not apply as evenly as I would have liked to have seen from the formula. The lipstick was comfortable to wear as it was lightly hydrating.",C
BECCA COSMETICS,SMOKY QUARTZ,Highlighter,"a muted, medium, rosy copper with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It seemed less metallic compared to other highlighters in the range, which may or may not be your cup of tea. It yielded a strong, noticeable glow on the skin that didn‚Äôt accentuate my natural skin texture but was still a stronger highlight. On my complexion, there was some warmth (without being orange-based) and color, so I would expect it to be more of a highlighting bronzer or blush on very fair skin tones and more of a sheen on deeper skin tones. The consistency was soft, smooth, and blendable without being dusty in the pan. The pigmentation was opaque and appeared a bit darker swatched and applied than it did in the pan. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.",A
HOURGLASS,I DREAM,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink coral with warm undertones and a cream finish. It was intensely pigmented and had full color coverage in a single pass. The consistency was lightweight, creamy without being too emollient or slippery, and comfortable to apply and to wear. On me, the color lasted for five hours and was hydrating.",A
CIATE,NOVA,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark copper with warmer, pink and gold pearl. The gloss shifted from pink shimmer to more golden orange shimmer, and this was one of the most obvious shifters in the range. It had semi-opaque pigmetnation with a smooth, lightweight texture that wasn‚Äôt sticky and was easy to spread across the lips. The gloss went on evenly and just had a touch of color that pulled into my deepest lip line. On me, it lasted for four hours and was moisturizing while worn.",B+
CIATE,VENUS,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark red with warm, brown undertones and fine, multi-colored pearl. It had a more shimmering, metallic sheen and did not shift much to my eye. The finish was mirror-like and reflected a lot of light, but the shimmer seemed mostly pink at any given moment (or angle!). The gloss felt lightweight, was moisturizing over time, and creamy going on, which made it easy to apply. The color payoff was semi-opaque, though, so it worked better alone than for layering unless one dabbed just a touch of it over another lip color and used a separate applicator (finger or otherwise) for blending/spreading. It lasted for four and a half hours on me.",B+
CIATE,ECLIPSE,Lipgloss,"a plummy brown with subtle, warm undertones and multi-colored pearl (mostly violet and fuchsia with a bit of gold and copper). This one did not seem to be much of a shifter‚Äìit was shiny and shimmery but not shifting to my eye. It had medium coverage that was comfortable to apply as the texture was lightweight and creamy, but the color went on unevenly and sat in my lip lines a bit. The gloss wore well for four hours on me.",B
COLOUR POP,BITS AND PIECES,Bronzer,"a dark, rosy brown with subtle, golden micro-shimmer over a mostly matte finish. It had good pigmentation, which was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The powder was soft, slightly thin and a little powdery to the touch, but it blended out easily on the skin and sat well on it, as it did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture nor did it appear dry or flat. On me, the bronzer stayed on well for eight and a half hours before fading slightly.",A-
CIATE,HOLLYWOOD,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium red with cool, blue undertones and flecks of fuchsia, ruby red, and silvery pink shimmer and glitter. It had good pigmentation in a single layer, which applied evenly on the lips. The texture was rather fluid to the point where it was hard to control the flow and spread of the product on the lips, so a lip brush might be necessary for really crisp, clean edges. It dried down fairly quickly, felt heavier and clingy on the lips, and there was a subtle tackiness to it after dry down. After I pressed my lips together, it went from faintly ruby-red metallic to sparkling with moderate glitter exposure. The color lasted for five and a half hours, left a slight stain behind, and was moderately drying over time. There were bits of color that crumbled away, as the formula was heavier and thicker after it dried down, so it was not a particularly flattering wear down.",B-
CIATE,FORTUNE,Lipgloss,"a deep, blackened purple with subtle warm undertones and a glittering finish. The consistency was very fluid but dried down to a heavier, thicker feel that clung to lips and had a tendency to crumble away from the center of my lips while I wore it. It was incredibly pigmented, and the evenness of the application was impressive for this type of color. After it dried down and I pressed my lips together, it was definitely noticeably more glittery and sparkly, but the heaviness of the texture seemed to cause some of the glitter to clump together and not look quite as sparkly as it could have. It lasted for six hours on me but did not wear down evenly at all and was fairly drying.",B-
TOO FACED,JUST PEACHY MATTES,Palette,"a new, 12-pan eyesahow palette with 11 matte finishes and one satin finish. According to the brand, the eyeshadows have ‚Äúintense color payoff that‚Äôs beyond blendable.‚Äù To the touch, the formula‚Äìin general‚Äìhad a drier, slightly chalky texture, and was firmer with a lot less powderiness compared to past eyeshadow releases from the brand. While they did not feel as velvety nor as finely-milled, I found them easier to work with in practice as they blended better without blending away to nothingness and were buildable when I wanted buildability.",B
MAKE UP FOR EVER,S404,Blush,"a dark, plummy brown with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. The powder had a moderately dense texture, which gave it a smooth feel across the surface without kicking up powder, but it took a slightly heavier hand or denser brush to pick up product‚ÄìI would not call it difficult, though. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that stayed on for nine hours on my skin. The issue I had with it was that the color took more effort to diffuse and blend out for even application.",B
ESTEE LAUDER,NOIR VANILLE,Palette,"a basic set of shades featuring a medium beige and a dark black both with more matte finishes. ¬†Noir proved more difficult to apply and blend out, and I suspect that many will prefer a black eyeshadow that‚Äôs more forgiving‚Äìone that can be used intensely but also more gradually‚Äìand Noir¬†was not that. ¬†Vanille was much easier to use but easily duped with a myriad of brands and shades given it is a basic neutral color (nothing wrong with that but lots of competition this color family).",B-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,CONNOR,Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium orange-red with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had very nearly opaque pigmentation that covered the lips evenly and smoothly. The texture was lightweight, smooth, and creamy enough to glide on without tugging, but the color adhered well to the lips and did not move around easily when worn. On me, it lasted for five hours and was lightly hydrating.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,FEDERICO,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, pink-coral with warm undertones and a creamy finish and light sheen. It had good color coverage, though it was not quite opaque, and had a moderately emollient texture that felt more on the slippery side on the lips. I felt like the added slip resulted in color that was a touch streaky along the edges and more prone to filling my lip lines noticeably. The color stayed on well for five hours and was hydrating over time.",B+
CHANEL,NIGHTFALL,Lipstick,"a muted, dark red with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had very subtle pearl‚Äìthe kind that yielded more of a noticeable sheen than a true frost or shimmery finish. The texture was lightweight, thin without being clingy, and velvety so it never tugged on the lips and was comfortable to apply and to wear. It had nearly opaque pigmentation, and the color applied evenly and smoothly on the lips. This shade lasted for six and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating on my lips.",A-
CHANEL,FIRST LIGHT,Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange-red with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had good color coverage in a single layer, though it was just shy of being opaque as there was a veil of translucency still. The texture was smooth, velvety without being wet or slippery, and it glided on without tugging on the lips. It was thinner but did not feel clingy, though there was a bit of color that sat in my lip lines that was less noticeable from a normal viewing distance due to the brighter color and greater coverage level. This shade lasted well for five hours and was non-drying.",B+
COLOUR POP,BOUJEE CALL,Highlighter,"a light gold with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It appeared a lot darker and more peach-toned in the pan but all I could see swatched and applied to my cheeks was gold. The texture had a smooth, moderately firm feel to it, and it took a heavier hand to get product onto my brush (or alternatively, use a denser brush). I had no trouble diffusing or blending out the edges of the highlighter on my skin, though, and there was no excess product kicked up in the pan as it was denser. It had good pigmentation, which was buildable to full coverage with a second layer but easily worn at sheerer coverage if desired. On me, the highlighter stayed on well for eight and a half hours before fading slightly.",B+
CHANEL,EXPERIMENTAL,Lipstick,"a bright, medium coral-red with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered the lips evenly with thin, lightweight color that was comfortable to wear and easy to apply. The lipstick was smooth, creamy without being slippery, and lasted for four hours on me. It left a very faint stain behind and was lightly hydrating.",B+
CHANEL,DAYLIGHT,Lipstick,"a light-medium, peachy beige with warmer undertones and a natural sheen. The consistency had some slip to it, which gave it a glossier finish compared to some of the other shades in the Rouge Coco range have had. While it glided across the lips easily, the color pooled in my lip lines noticeably and beyond just the deeper lines. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that did not appear streaky, which was a plus and noteworthy for this type of color (with this finish). On me, it lasted for two and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing over time.",C
BITE BEAUTY,LIQUORICE,Lipstick,"a deep red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a moderate shine. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied decently but could have been a little more even‚Äìthere were areas where the color seemed almost grainy and a little patchy to my eye along with a minor amount of color that sank into my lip lines. The crayon had a moderately emollient, creamy texture that was easy to glide across the lips but a lip liner or lip brush would be recommended for crisper edges. On me, the color lasted for five and a half hours, left a subtle stain behind, and was hydrating.",B
BITE BEAUTY,BLACK TRUFFLE,Lipstick,"a deep, blackened purple with subtle, warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had good color payoff in a single layer, though it was not quite opaque. The more emollient texture made it more of a challenge to apply along my inner portion of my lips, where I felt the lipstick just did not adhere as evenly or as nicely as to other areas of my lips. It was, of course, comfortable to use and felt hydrating while worn. This shade stayed on well for five hours but feathered along the edges (which is not something I tend to experience often).",B
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,DANGEROUS LIAISON,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark reddish plum with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. The color payoff was opaque in a single layer, and the color applied evenly on the lips. The texture was airy, thin, and mousse-like, so it did not feel like it slid around when worn and was easy to keep the product even along the edges of my lips. This was one of the more flattering shades and was more forgiving with respect to my lip lines. On me, it lasted for five hours and was neither drying nor hydratnig.",A-
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,SCREEN SIREN,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark red with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, but the color went on evenly and smoothly, and it sat the best on my lips out of all ten shades available. This shade did not sink into my lip lines during initial application nor did it do so later on as I wore it, which was a major plus. The texture was smooth, velvety, and mousse-like, which made it easy to get crisper edges than with a traditional liquid lipstick, which would have a lot more slip. The lipstick wore well for six hours, left a faint stain behind, and was non-drying.",A
THEBALM,BALM SPRINGS,Blush,"a muted, medium coral with soft, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had opaque color coverage with a soft, silky texture that was a little thin and a touch powdery in the pan, but it was easy to apply to the skin and blend out. It‚Äôs supposed to be ‚Äúlong-wearing‚Äù with a ‚Äúfade-resistant formula.‚Äù The blush lasted for nine hours on me before fading slightly, which made it better than the typical blush.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,S502,Blush,"a deep plum with subtle, cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer and easily built-up to full coverage if desired with not even a full second layer. The texture was smooth and moderately dense in the pan, and though it felt like the majority of the line, it did not blend out as evenly or as easily as other shades have for me. It looked a little patchy on me even after buffing and blending with vigor. It did wear really well at nine hours, but I just wish it was easier to work with on the skin. To make it more even, I would use my foundation brush and buff and blend the edges (though I did not do so when I tested for wear).",B+
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,BEST ACTRESS,Lipstick,"a medium-dark peachy brown with warm undertones and a satin sheen. It had opaque pigmentation that covered the lips fairly evenly, but some of the color pulled into my lip lines. The formula (generally) had a tendency to do this as it wore, so it was just worse with this particular shade. The texture was smooth, mousse-like, and easy to spread across the lips. It was comfortable to wear for the four and a half hours it lasted before fading and settling into lip lines enough to merit a reapplication, but it was, at least, not drying.",B
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,CHARLOTTE DARLING,Lipstick,"a medium peach with warm, orange undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was great, while the texture was velvety, mousse-like, and comfortable to spread across the lips and to wear. There was some slip to it, and I noticed the color gravitated into my lip lines both during the initial application as well as later on during wear. The sheen faded after an hour and a half of wear, but there was no full ‚Äúdry down‚Äù and it always remained a touch tacky and movable on me, so it was not smudge-proof at all. It lasted for four hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,PLATINUM BLONDE,Lipstick,"a light-medium, peachy coral with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had intense pigmentation that covered the lips with even, opaque coverage. The consistency was lightweight with a more mousse-like feel, so it never pooled or was difficult to control along the edges of the lips. I did notice that the texture seemed chalkier compared to other shades in the range, and it felt clingier over time. The color wore well for four hours but had moderate settling into lip lines over time, while the formula was slightly drying.",B-
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,TOO BAD I'M BAD,Lipstick,"a medium, pinky coral with soft, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had opaque color coverage that applied evenly across the lips, but the color ‚Äúsplit‚Äù along my deeper lip lines so it was not the most flattering texture on. The liquid lipstick had a velvety, airy, mousse-like consistency that glided across with ease and never felt wet. The ‚Äúdry down‚Äù isn‚Äôt like your typical liquid lipstick, as it did not set to a transfer-proof finish and felt a touch tacky whenever I pressed my lips together. It wore well for four and a half hours with color that gathered in my lip lines over time, while the formula was neither drying nor hydrating.",B
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,SHOW GIRL,Lipstick,"a medium-dark plum with neutrla-to-warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. The pigmentation was opaque, while the consistency was mousse-like, velvety, and airy on the lips, so it was comfortable to wear and spread easily across the lips. It did not seem quite as ‚Äúdry‚Äù as other shades, so there was a bit more of a sheen initially but it disappeared within an hour and a half of wear. The color lasted for a solid five hours but had color separate around my lip lines over time.",B+
DOSE OF COLORS,OVER THE TOP,Lipstick,"a clear gloss with flecks of medium-sized gold sparkle. It‚Äôs not designed to be much more than a clear gloss with gold sparkle in it (it‚Äôs actually described as ‚Äúa mega-shine clear gloss infused with reflective gold reflects‚Äù). It had noticeable sparkle but wasn‚Äôt chocked-full of it either. The texture was smooth, lightweight, and non-tacky on the lips, and the gloss spread easily across my lips. I had a sweet, vanilla-like scent but no discernible taste. The gloss lasted for an hour and a half on me and seemed slightly hydrating.",B
COLOUR POP,TOTAL PACKAGE,Highlighter,"a medium, rosy copper with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. The texture was slightly looser in the pan, so there was some excess powder that was kicked up in the pan after using it with a brush, though it did not appear dry or dusty on the skin. There were slightly larger sparkles in the finish, too, so it would be ideal for someone who likes a more shimmery finish in their highlighter/blush. When applied as sheer to medium coverage, it sat well on the skin but at fuller ocverage, it emphasized my skin‚Äôs natural texture slightly. It was richly pigmented and very blendable, while the formula lasted eight hours on my skin before fading.",B+
NARS,ALTIPLANO,Eyeliner,"a muted, medium gold with warm, brown undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-opaque color payoff in one layer, which built up to nearly full coverage with a second layer. The pencil had a smooth, lightly creamy texture that felt more waxy than wet or creamy, and it glided across the lash line without tugging as a result. It lasted for five hours on my waterline and eight hours on my lower lash line.",B
NARS,NAXOS,Eyeliner,"a medium-dark blue with subtle, cooler undertones and a sparkling, pearl sheen. It had good pigmentation in a single layer, and it was buildable to full coverage with two layers. The consistency was smooth, not too waxy or too creamy, so it was comfortable to apply but set quickly. It wore well for eight hours on my lower lash line, and due to the amount of shimmer in it, I did not test it on my waterline.",A-
MAC,VIVA GLAM TARAJI P. HENSON 2,Lipstick,"a deep, reddish brown with warmer undertones and multi-colored, metallic shimmer‚Äìa mix of green, gold, and copper. It had good pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage. The consistency was lightweight, thin but not clingy, and smooth, which made it easy to maneuver across the lips. The lipstick went on evenly and lasted for five hours on me, while the formula was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
MAC,VIVA GLAM TARAJI P. HENSON 2,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark gold with warm, brown undertones and lighter gold flecks of shimmer and some sparkle. The texture was smooth, light-medium in weight, and moderately tacky, though I think if you have not tried MAC‚Äôs newer Lipglasses (over the last few years), you might find them a lot easier to wear, as they do not feel as thick overall. The gloss was lightly hydrating on me over the four and a half hours it lasted for. The downside, though, was the gloss wasn‚Äôt described as sheer, and the Lipglass formula is supposed to be pigmented.",B
DOSE OF COLORS,THE GIRLS,Palette,"contains four sparkling, metallic powder eyeshadows housed in a slim compact with a shimmering fabric exterior. Noli is the only shade that did not say it needed to be applied with a finger for best color payoff; Suz and Harpoon need to be used with a dampened finger. I‚Äôm not personally a fan of using my fingertips for application, since I find there‚Äôs no precision based on my fingertip to lid size ratio, so I did try using brushes to see how that went in addition to testing with fingertips (and the latter is the only application method reflected in the ratings) for the three shades listed for use with fingers.",B+
DOSE OF COLORS,HOT FIRE,Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium orange-red with strong, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had opaque color payoff in a single layer, and the color applied beautifully to the lips with smooth, even coverage that made my lips look smoother than they naturally were. The consistency was lightweight, thin but not watery, and easy to work with to spread across the lips, despite the formula drying down pretty quickly. On me, the lipstick stayed on on well for six and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
DOSE OF COLORS,SAV√°GE,Lipstick,"deep, reddish burgundy with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was thin without being watery, fluid enough to be spread easily across the lips, and dried down quickly (but wasn‚Äôt difficult to maneuver or fix edges while the rest of the layer dried down). It had good pigmentation, though it would take a second layer for full coverage. The color went on evenly for the most part, but again, there were areas where coverage was more even than others and a bit of color pulled into my lip lines as it dried down. The formula was moderately comfortable, non-drying, and lasted for seven hours on me.",B+
DOSE OF COLORS,M√≠RAME,Highlighter,"a medium, rosy copper with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, but it had a blendable texture that made it easy to use less or to diffuse for sheerer coverage if desired.",A
ANASTASIA,ROSEWOOD,Lipstick,"a medium-dark plum with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had opaque color payoff in a single layer, and the lipstick was dense enough that it tugged on the lips, but it managed to apply evenly across the lips and did not appear dry or ragged (despite feeling like it would look like that!). The color wore well for five and a half hours and didn‚Äôt feel drying on.",A-
ANASTASIA,RUM PUNCH,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark plum with neutral-to-warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. There was a subtle sheen to the finish after initial application, though it wore away within an hour of wear. The lipstick had a denser consistency that felt firm against the lips and tugged as I tried to glide the bullet across my lips, but it managed to apply even, opaque coverage in a single stroke. This shade lasted well for five and a half hours and was comfortable to wear, as it was not drying.",A-
ANASTASIA,RAGE,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark purple with warmer, pink undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation, though it was not quite opaque, and the coverage did not appear streaky but it did seem deeper and lighter in places. This would be a shade I‚Äôd recommend wearing with a lip liner for absolute coverage and precision. The consistency was lightweight in feel, but the lipstick was dense and firm in the tube, so it tugged quite a bit when I applied it to my lips. It lasted well for over six hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,26 OLD SILVER,Eyeshadow,"muted, medium silvery lavender with cool undertones and a metallic sheen. Applied dry, it had sheer coverage, which was buildable to medium coverage. Applied damp, it had opaque pigmentation that was still blendable and easy to work with. On the cheeks, it definitely worked as a highlighter but added some cooler coloring, too, and on my complexion, would be better suited when paired with a blush to help give it more depth and dimension but could be quite lovely on cooler skin tones on its own. It had a more metallic sheen that seemed quite smooth to my eye and did not accentuate the texture of my skin. On me, the powder wore well for eight hours.",B+
DOSE OF COLORS,FUEGO,Highlighter,"a medium gold with warm, orange undertones and a metallic sheen. The finish was incredibly shiny but did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture.",A
NARS,AYA,Lipstick,"a deep, chocolatly brown with subtle, warm undertones and a creamy finish paired with a soft sheen. It had opaque color payoff in a single layer, which applied evenly and smoothly across the lips and never tugged. The lipstick felt moderately creamy, not too thin or too thick, and sat fairly well on the lips, though there was enough slip that it was noticeable on the lips. I did not experience any feathering over the five and a half hours this shade wore for, and the formula was lightly hydrating overall.",A
NARS,DAYLE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium lavender mauve with neutral-to-warm undertones and a cream finish. It looked drastically different swatched and applied than in the tube‚Äìinitially! While often, the color of a lipstick (in the tube) will look a bit lighter/darker after being used, this particular shade went from a warmer, rosy pink exterior to reveal a mauvy interior (the color swatched). I was so caught off-guard by the difference that I thought my camera‚Äôs color balance went awry but lo and behold, I could distinctively see the rosy pink exterior and cooler interior in person.",A
NARS,KIRAT,Lipstick,"a deep purple with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation paired with a creamy, moderately emollient texture that glided across the lips easily but still managed to apply the color evenly. I had a bit of color that pulled into lip lines over the five and a half hours this shade lasted for, and there was a slight stain left behind as well. The formula felt lightly hydrating over time.",A-
COLOUR POP,ANGEL FOOD,Highlighter,"as soft, light-medium pink with warmer undertones and a metallic sheen. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, soft consistency that was moderately dense but not difficult to apply or to blend out on the skin‚Äìit was dense enough just to avoid powderiness in the pan. On my skin tone, a lot of the pinkness seemed to get lost as I diffused and blended it out, but on fairer complexions, I suspect it could also be worn as a shimmering blush. The highlighter wore well for eight hours before fading.",A-
HOURGLASS,I'M ADDICTED,Lipstick,"a soft, medium brown with warm, rosy undertones and a satin finish. The color payoff was nearly opaque, and the lipstick applied the coverage evenly and smoothly. The texture was lightweight, creamy without being heavy or too emollient, and was easy to apply. It lasted for four and a half hours on me and was lightly moisturizing over time.",A-
MAC,PRISSY PRINCESS,Palette,"a set lighter neutrals with one darker neutral that runs more neutral-to-warm than very-warm-toned. For someone who prefers lighter neutrals that are buildable and likely uses primer regularly, it might be worth considering, but with a sea of neutral palettes to choose from, there are many others of higher quality.",C+
HOURGLASS,SECRETLY,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark red with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had intense, full color payoff in a single layer, while the lipstick had a lightweight, creamy texture that applied evenly and glided effortlessly across the lips but still sat well, didling gather in my lip lines, and was comfortable to wear. This shade was still going strong after six hours of wear and was lightly moisturizing.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,1 FROZEN SILVER,Highlighter,"a light, bright silver with cooler undertones and a frosted sheen. I‚Äôm not entirely sure why they went with the ‚ÄúFrozen‚Äù label here, as all of the other ‚ÄúFrozen‚Äù shades were duochromes but this one wasn‚Äôt. It does, though, brighten well as it was lighter and brighter in hue. It had semi-sheer coverage applied dry, which was buildable to semi-opaque coverage, and then opaque coverage when applied with a dampened brush (just using water). The consistency was soft, blendable, and easy to work with on the skin and did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. This shade wore well for eight hours on me.",A-
CHANEL,CITY LIGHTS,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette for fall that features three neutrals and a soft, pale pink. As much as I liked the idea of this, the shades did not mesh as well together as I expected based on past experience with Chanel‚Äôs quads. I can see it working well for someone who tends to use one or two shades but found the undertones to be a little competing instead of harmonious when using three or four shades together, personally (this subjective observations had no impact on rating). The quality of three shades was quite nice‚Äìpigmented, easy to use, long-wearing‚Äìwhile the light pink was rather sheer.",B+
HOURGLASS,I'VE BEEN,Lipstick,"a medium, plummy brown with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. The texture was lightweight, creamy without being slippery, and glided on with ease. This shade wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A
CHANEL,ROAD MOVIE,Palette,"a new, permanent palette featuring a beige, golden copper, bluish teal, and a blackened blue. It had a murky, smoky vibe with pops of color. It was decent but for someone who wants really rich, intense pigmentation, I think they would be happier with another brand, while those who prefer more buildable, softer, and more muted smoky hues, this might appeal.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,B218,Blush,"a rich, medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a semi-matte finish. The pigmentation was intense with full coverage achievable with little product, but the denser consistency gave me a lot of control over the application to avoid going completely overboard with it.",A
CLE DE PEAU,LOTUS FLOWER,Lipstick,"a muted, medium coral with warm undertones and a luminous finish. It had nearly opaque color payoff with a smooth, lightweight texture that was creamy enough to glide on the lips but was not so slippery that it was a high-maintenance shade to wear. I felt like the formula made my lips appear slightly plumper and smoother, even though there was a touch of color in my deeper lip lines. This shade had fine shimmer, which wasn‚Äôt something most shades contained. It wore well for four and a half hours and was moisturizing over time.",B-
CLE DE PEAU,CAMELLIA,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, coral-orange with warm undertones and a soft sheen. There was a bit of gold pearl, but it was very minor and almost undetectable in person. The consistency was lightly creamy with some slip, but it seemed to turn a touch tacky after thirty seconds from the initial application, which helped the color adhere better overall. The color payoff was semi-opaque but did not build up much beyond that. It wore well for four and a half hours and was hydrating while worn.",C+
CLE DE PEAU,PASSION FLOWER,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and golden pearl. It had good pigmentation, though it was shy of full coverage, that covered the lips with smooth, even color. The texture was lightweight, creamy, and a touch slippery initially, but it became marginally tacky as it ‚Äúset‚Äù no the lips. This shade lasted for five hours and was incredibly moisturizing to wear.",B-
ANASTASIA,ORCHID,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark magenta with cooler undertones and a matte finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied with even coverage, despite the firmer, denser consistency tugging considerably on the lips. The formula felt thin on the lips without being clingy, so it adhered for hours‚Äìit was still going strong after six hours of wear‚Äìbut was surprisingly comfortable and ultra-lightweight. It did not dry out my lips at all!",A-
ANASTASIA,STARGAZER,Lipstick,"a bright, medium fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a semi-matte finish. The consistency was smoother and creamier compared to other shades, so it only lightly tugged on my lips as I tried to glide the lipstick across them. However, the color did not apply nearly as smoothly as other shades‚Äìit seemed to separate around areas of texture on my lips and was a smidgen streaky on the edges. The lipstick stayed on well for five and a half hours, left a stain behind, and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
ANASTASIA,RUBY,Lipstick,"a deep red with cool, bluish undertones and a matte finish. It had very nearly opaque pigmentation that covered the lips evenly. The texture felt very lightweight when worn, though the lipstick had a much stiffer consistency as I applied it from the tube to the point where it tugged on my lips. On me, the color was still mostly intact after six hours of wear and left a strong stain behind, and the formula was non-drying.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,3 FROZEN ORANGE,Eyeshadow,"a cool, white base with pink to golden orange shift. It had semi-sheer, buildable coverage applied dry and opaque coverage applied with a dampened brush. The finish was shimmery with slightly larger sparkles here and there, but it did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.",A-
HOURGLASS,I BELIEVE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage that glided onto the lips evenly and smoothly without tugging on the lips during application. The consistency was lightweight, creamy but not slippery, and comfortable to wear. It lasted for five hours and was lightly hydrating.",A
ANASTASIA,SMOKE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, bluish gray with cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a lightweight, lightly creamy texture that was denser and thicker on the lips compared to other shades, though it felt the same in terms of weight. I noticed this particular shade also felt creamier and did not tug as much compared to others in the line-up. It wore well for five hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
ANASTASIA,RESIN,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, purplish taupe with neutral undertones and a matte finish. It had good color payoff, though it was not quite opaque, with a lightly creamy texture that tugged on the lips a bit but was not as stiff or firm in the tube compared to the majority of shades in the formula. I did notice, however, that this shade seemed prone to emphasizing my lip lines as the color split around them. On me, the color lasted for five hours and felt non-drying but the color did pull into my lip lines more as it wore on.",B
ANASTASIA,GRIFFIN,Lipstick,"a deep, grayish taupe with neutral-to-cool undertones and a mostly matte finish. The texture was firm in the tube, so the lipstick tugged as it applied, though the color went on fairly evenly and did not drag or appear ragged on. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that lasted for a good five hours, while the formula felt lightweight and non-drying.",B+
MILK MAKEUP,MARS,Highlighter,"a pale, pinky beige with a pink-to-lavender shift. It was more of a duochrome than Supernova but the finish was much more subdued and more like a faint pearl than a true shimmery. The effect of this one was more noticeable when layered with blushes, as it would alter the blush a bit more noticeably than when this was applied on the face by itself. All that being said, subtle doesn‚Äôt quite seem to be what the brand had in mind as they call the formula ‚Äúintense.‚Äù",B
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M206,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark mauve with subtle, neutral-to-cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a smooth, lightly creamy consistency that glided across the lips with ease and never felt clingy. I actually felt like it seeemed a lot creamier than past mattes‚Äìmore like a hybrid between the Cream and Matte formulas (see my original overview). The formula wore well for five and a half hours and was non-drying while worn.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M502,Lipstick,"a medium-dark purple with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had medium coverage, which was buildable to semi-opaque payoff at most. The consistency felt creamy and comfortable to apply to the lips, but it applied terribly with streakiness, unevenness, and color that gathered on itself and looked grainy on the lips. To top it all off, the color separated at my lip lines and made them appear more prominent. It lasted for four and a half hours but color further pulled into my lines over time. The formula was, at the very least, not drying, so there was a margin upside.",C-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,B316,Blush,"a bright, medium pinky coral with warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. The matte finish never looked flat or dry on the skin and seemed to look natural but not shimmery or shiny on the skin. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied evenly to the skin and blended out with ease. Worth noting, the denser formula tends to accommodate heavier handed folks or moderately dense blush brushes but feathery brushes (like a fan brush) do not pick up product as well and often applies product unevenly. It wore well for nine hours on me before fading slightly.",A
CLE DE PEAU,CHINOISERIE,Lipstick,"a medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and a natural sheen. It had good color payoff in a single layer, but it was not completely opaque on the lips. The lipstick had a smooth, creamyt exture that was lightweight with some slip, but it did not slide around as much on the lips as I thought it would, possibly as it had a bit of tackiness to it. The color went on very evenly across the lips and there was a touch of color in my deeper lip lines but all my lip lines still were softer and smoother. This shade lasted for four hours and was moisturizing over time.",B-
CLE DE PEAU,CHINA DOLL,Lipstick,"a soft, medium plum with subtle, warm undertones and a creamy finish with a light sheen. The consistency was lightweight, smooth, creamy but had a light tackiness to it after a few seconds that helped it adhere better than I expected it would (by just how creamy it felt going on). It had nearly opaque pigmentation that covered the lips with even coverage and the texture of the lipstick camouflaged a lot of the texture of my lips but not all. It wore well for four and a half hours and was very hydrating.",B
CLE DE PEAU,PILLOW BOOK,Lipstick,"a deep, reddened berry with subtle, cool undertones and a glossy finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that went on fairly evenly, but there was color that pulled into my lip lines and made them appear darker. I also felt like the pigment did not seem as well-mixed as other shades as there flecks of product that were darker on my lips (more noticeable to the eye in the swatch). The texture was moderately emollient but did not feather on me when I tested it. The lipstick wore well five hours and was nicely hydrating.",C
MAKE UP FOR EVER,B500,Blush,"a pinky plum with subtle, warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had nearly full color payoff in a single layer, but the denser consistency made it easier to use it with a lighter hand as it did not have a bunch of powder that kicked up with use. The intensity of the shade did seem to lend to more difficulty blending it out, even when I used it with a lighter hand. It also seemed to darken slightly and appeared less rosy on me (almost cooler in tone after I blended it out).",B
CLE DE PEAU,RED CARPET,Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium-dark pinky red with cool, blue undertones and a soft shine. It had good pigmentation, though it did not have full coverage and was not buildable to full coverage. The consistency was incredibly smooth, silky, and creamy without being heavy or thick‚Äìit looked almost like a gloss with just how smooth it made my lips appear. You can noticeably see the difference between the texture of my lips with this shade on and Water Lily (below), which goes to show just how effective the formula can be. It wore well for five and a half hours,, left a slight stain behind, and was moisturizing.",A-
CLE DE PEAU,WATER LILY,Lipstick,"a muted, medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a luminous finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a soft, creamy consistency that was lightweight and comfortable to apply and to wear. The color applied evenly, but I noticed some of it gathered in my deeper lip lines, though it did not worsen as I wore the lipstick. On me, it stayed on well for four and a half hours and was very moisturizing.",B-
ANASTASIA,COOL BROWN,Lipstick,"a muted, dark brown with subtle, rosy undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, and the color applied evenly to the lips, even though it did tug as I glided the lipstick across my lips. It had a firm, dense consistency but managed not to drag or apply raggedly, and this particular shade was even firmer/stiffer than others in the line-up. My lips were fairly smooth but this seemed to emphasize the texture of my lips when there was so little to emphasize. On me, it lasted for five hours and was non-drying but felt very lightweight.",B
ANASTASIA,DUSTY MAUVE,Lipstick,"a dark, purple mauve with neutral undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good pigmentation‚Äìjust shy of truly full coverage‚Äìwith a dense, firm texture that tugged on my lips noticeably when applying and took moderate pressure to glide across the lips. The odd part of the formula was just that it actually felt very lightweight, the color went on evenly, and didn‚Äôt feel drying over time. It wore well for five and a half hours on me.",B+
ANASTASIA,RUST,Lipstick,"a deep, muted brown with subtle, warm red undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good color coverage in a single stroke, though the texture seemed more prone to emphasizing the natural texture of my lips. It had a thicker, slightly creamier feel compared to other shades in the range but still was a firmer, denser lipstick that tugged slightly as I applied it to my lips. The color stayed on well for six hours but pulled into my lip lines over time. It felt lightweight and non-drying while worn.",B
MAKE UP FOR EVER,H100,Blush,"a bright ivory with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It appeared a bit darker in the pan than when swatched, where it had a starker, brighter look overall. It did apply noticeably on my skin, despite being so light, and it will appeal to those who prefer highlighting with matte to satin finishes over more shimmery ones that we have seen a lot of in the last year. I tried using it a few different times paired with other products to see the highlighting effect more, but it had a tendency to look unblended even though it seemed diffused to my eye in photos; it definitely looked better in person as a result. The cconsistency was smooth, dense but not stiff or difficult to apply, and it had opaque coverage. The highlighter lasted for eight hours on me before fading.",A-
ANASTASIA,DEAD ROSES,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark plum with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had opaque color coverage in a single layer with a featherweight feel on the lips. The consistency was dense and firm, so there was slight tugging on the lips as I glided the lipstick across my lips, though it still applied the color evenly. Despite the firmness of the formula, it was comfortable to wear and non-drying over the five and a half hours it lasted for.",A-
ANASTASIA,ROGUE,Lipstick,"a dark, brownish red with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It will wear down to a matte finish within an hour or with a light blotting, though. It had rich, opaque color payoff that applied evenly. The texture was slightly creamier than most in the range and just barely tugged when applied directly from the tube onto the lips. I found the formula non-drying, while the color lasted for a solid six hours on me.",A
ANASTASIA,LATTE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark rosy brown with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation‚Äìjust shy of full coverage‚Äìthat applied even, smooth coverage on the lips, though the lipstick itself was firmer and tugged on the lips as I tried to glide it across them. The consistency felt very lightweight on the lips, thin in a way but not clingy. It wore well for four and a half hours on me and had a bit of color that pulled into my lip lines over time.",B+
ANASTASIA,BRONZED,Highlighter,"a deep copper with warm, red undertones and fine gold and bronze pearl. The sheen was subtle with semi-sheer coverage applied to the skin and had noticeable sparkle (though it seemed quite fine, not chunky or glittery and did not add texture to my skin). The subtle glow did not translate well on camera, though I could see a faint sheen in person.",D-
ANASTASIA,OYSTER,Highlighter,"a light, peachy beige with pink and gold pearl. It had sheer coverage and a subtle glow on the skin when I used a small dab of product, as the brand recommended. I was able to build up the intensity of the highlighter with two to three layers on top (just make sure to let each layer dry!) over bare skin. In the photo, it shows what the recommended amount looks like on my skin, which ultimately looks like nothing in the photo but had a faint sheen in person.",F
MAKE UP FOR EVER,S114,Blush,"a light-medium brown with soft, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which was buildable, with a smooth, dense texture. It‚Äôs a lighter shade, so for contouring, I could see it working on light to light-medium skin tones, and it could also work as a subtle, brown blush. The powder blended out seamlessly on the skin and took little work to get it there. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me.",B+
LORAC,UNZIPPED DESERT SUNSET,Palette,"ten shades in hues of warm neutrals to the tune of copper, bronze, and brown with pops of purple, red, and berry. This was the best performing palette of the Sunset series, which was not a surprise given that warmer neutrals tend to be more pigmented/less difficult to do given the plethora of well-rated warm eyeshadow palettes out there!",B+
COLOUR POP,DARLING,Lipstick,"a deep plum with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer with a smooth, fluid consistency that was too thin or too thick, so it spread easily across the lips but did not slide around once on. There was a light tackiness to the texture after a couple of minutes, but pressing my lips together did not lift any color. The sheen wore down after three and a half hours of wear. The color stayed on well for over six hours and was non-drying.",A
COLOUR POP,MRS.,Lipstick,"a dusty, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. The consistency was a bit thicker than the average Ultra Satin from what I could tell, and it had less of a sheen as well. It was still fluid and easy to spread across the lips but almost felt mousse-like. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that covered the lips evenly with just a smidgen of color that sat in my deeper lip lines. The lipstick lasted for six and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
ANASTASIA,SUBCULTURE,Palette,"14 eyeshadows with three shimmery shades and the rest having a matte finish. I suspect that the palette is going to be a love/hate product in the community as sometimes it can produce really stunning looks and other times, it feels like a lot of work to make the palette come together. I feel the color scheme works cohesively as a concept, but the products themselves were troublesome to get to work together sometimes. ¬†My best tips for working with this palette are:",B-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,B204,Blush,"a light, cotton candy pink with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. The shimmer was quite fine, so it sat well on the skin and never emphasized my natural texture. As I buffed and blended the blush onto my skin, it yielded a soft sheen that looked natural and not shimmery. It had rich, opaque color coverage with a moderately dense, smooth texture, the type that feels like it has silicones in it and will work better with a moderate hand or a denser blush brush. It wore well for nine hours on me before fading slightly.",A
PAT MCGRATH,ELSON,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark red with neutral-to-cool undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied beautifully‚Äìeven, smooth, and flattering on the lips. The consistency was light-medium in thickness but still felt rather lightweight with a bit of creaminess as the lipstick warmed up against my lips. The color wore well for over six hours, left a stain behind, and was slightly drying after four hours of wear.",A
PAT MCGRATH,OBSESSED,Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange with warm, red undertones and a cream finish. It had intense, opaque color coverage with a creamy, smooth consistency that had some slip but seemed to ‚Äúset‚Äù after a half hour and did not slide around. The texture was easy to work with, as it never dragged or tugged, but I did have a bit of color that pulled into my lip lines initially that I was able to smooth out (without it returning) after some of the shine went away. It stayed on well for five and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
PAT MCGRATH,FULL PANIC,Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium-dark fuchsia with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a smooth, velvety texture that was creamy without being slippery. There was something about the texture, though, that did not sit as smoothly on my lips as other shades‚Äìit seemed to highlight imperfections with some color slipping into my lip lines as well. The lipstick wore well for five and a half hours, left a reddish stain behind, and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,S214,Blush,"a muted, medium-dark pink with neutral-to-cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had more of a ‚Äúnatural matte‚Äù finish where the finish did not appear dry, flat, or truly matte‚Äìit looked like ‚Äúmy skin but better.‚Äù What I liked was that it did not appear to darken on the skin over time, which more matte powders can do as they interact with oils found on the skin.",A
LORAC,UNZIPPED MOUNTAIN SUNSET,Palette,"ten shades in a ‚Äúcooler‚Äù set of neutrals with a few less neutral shades. I wouldn‚Äôt describe it as a genuinely cool-toned palette, but they were not nearly as warm-toned as most palettes are these days.",B+
HOURGLASS,I WISH,Lipstick,"a light peach with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentaiton in a single layer that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips without dragging. The texture was very lightweight but was thicker than the average lipstick, and I did have a bit of color that pulled into my lip lines with this particular shade. It wore well for four hours and was lightly moisturizing.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,DEMI-GLACE,Lipstick,"a subdued, medium-dark plummy brown with subtle, warm undertones and a glossy, cream finish. The consistency was smooth, lightweight, and easily spread across the lips for even, opaque coverage. There was a smidgen of color that pulled into my deeper lip lines but the shinier finish helped minimize how noticeable that was. The lip color stayed on well for five hours and was moisturizing over time.",A
BITE BEAUTY,CANDIED,Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium pinky-red with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. It was intensely pigmented with a very smooth, fluid, and cream-like texture that wasn‚Äôt too thin or too thick, so it spread well and went on evenly. There was a light tackiness that helped ensure the color stayed in place but was still comfortable to wear. This shade wore well for five and a half hours, left a stain behind, and was hydrating.",A
BITE BEAUTY,FLAMB√©,Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium orange with warm, red undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage in a single layer with a smooth consistency that was lightweight, not too thin or too thick, and was lightly tacky overall. I noticed that this particular shade was less pigmented and looked more translucent on the lips compared to others‚Äìmore jelly-like than a true cream. On me, I was able to get five hours of wear out of this shade, and there was a subtle stain left behind, while the formula felt moisturizing.",A-
SEPHORA,TWILIGHT,Highlighter,"a brighter, light-medium lavender with cool undertones and a luminous sheen. It had a noticeable glow on the skin, but it did not accentuate my skin‚Äôs natural texture.",A-
NARS,NARSISSIST (2017),Palette,"six miniature-sized Velvet Lip Glides in new, limited edition shades. The set is exclusively available at Ulta. I think if you‚Äôre a fan of the formula, the set is worth checking out as it contains quite a bit of product ($93.60 worth of Velvet Lip Glides) and overall, the formula was consistent with the permanent range of Velvet Lip Glides.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,B302,Blush,"a brighter, light-medium pink-coral with very fine, golden pearl. It had a more satin-like finish, where there was a soft glow to the skin but never looked frosted, sparkly, or metallic. It had opaque color coverage in a single layer, but the consistency was denser, which made it more forgiving if one wanted to use a lighter touch (as you would not pickup as much product that way) so I felt like I had good control over using it. A moderately dense brush with a moderate hand yielded full coverage, so it also did not take building up to get there. The blush blended out easily and sat well on the skin. On me, it wore well for nine hours before fading slightly.",A
NARS,MUSTANG,Palette,"four Velvet Matte Lip Pencils in four new, limited edition shades. This is one of two sets that are available exclusively at Nordstrom for their Anniversary sale. The Velvet Matte Lipstick formula is supposed to have ‚Äúrich, vivid pigments‚Äù with a ‚Äúvelvety matte finish‚Äù that is ‚Äúnon-drying.‚Äù I liked this set better than the Tribulation set, as the shades were more pigmented, longer-wearing, and more flattering applied to the lips.",B+
WET 'N' WILD,GOLDEN FLOWER CROWN,Highlighter,"medium gold with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. The finish was very reflective, and it was slightly emphasizing of my skin‚Äôs natural texture at higher coverage levels.",B+
NARS,TRIBULATION,Palette,"four Velvet Matte Lip Pencils in four new, limited edition shades. Unfortunately, I was not able to finish testing the shades for wear before this set sold out online, but it may still be available at your local Nordstrom (it is an Anniversary sale exclusive). The Velvet Matte Lipstick formula is supposed to have ‚Äúrich, vivid pigments‚Äù with a ‚Äúvelvety matte finish‚Äù that is ‚Äúnon-drying.‚Äù",B
SEPHORA,HIGH NOON,Highlighter,"a medium copper with golden shimmer and a more frosted sheen when swatched. On the skin, it had a more luminous finish that was glowing but not metallic.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,BRAISED,Lipstick,"a bold, reddish plum with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It was nearly opaque in pigmentation with a very smooth, lightweight consistency that spread evenly across the lips and was very comfortable to wear. The texture was lightly tacky but never heavy or goopy, and it seemed to sit better on the lips than other shades as well. The color stayed on for almost six hours and was moisturizing over time.",A
BITE BEAUTY,SUPREME,Lipstick,"a rich berry with cool undertones and a cream finish. It had good color coverage‚Äìjust shy of full coverage as I could see a hint of my lip freckle peeking through‚Äìthat covered the lips evenly and smoothly. The liquid lipstick was smooth, lightweight, not too thin or too thick, and easy to work with on the lips. There was a smidgen of color that pulled into my deeper lip lines, but between the color and the opacity, it was not noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The color lasted for six hours and left a stain behind, while the formula was hydrating.",A
WET 'N' WILD,ROYAL CALYX,Highlighter,"a light-medium lavender with cool undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. There were larger sparkles within this shade compared to others within the range, and there was some emphasis of my skin‚Äôs natural texture when applied at semi-opaque coverage or greater.",B
WET 'N' WILD,ROSE CHAMPAGNE,Blush,"a soft peach with warm undertones and fine, gold pearl. It had a subtle shimmer-sheen finish that became softly luminous when buffed and blended out on the skin.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,√ÂCLAIR,Lipstick,"a brighter, medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It was richly pigmented with a creamy, lightweight texture was smooth, lightly tacky, and easy to spread across the lips for even coverage. I had just the slightest amount of product settle into my deeper lip lines but the shine helped to minimize the appearance from a normal viewing distance. It wore well for five hours and was moisturizing while worn.",A
BITE BEAUTY,CHUTNEY,Lipstick,"a muted, medium rosy mauve with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. The consistency was smooth, fluid but not too thick or too thin, and still quite lightweight on the lips with a touch of tackiness that helped keep it in place‚Äìno feathering on me. It had opaque color coverage that applied evenly and lasted for five hours. The formula was comfortable to wear and hydrating. The only issue I had was that it seemed to emphasize my lip lines a bit due to a bit of settling (though it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance.)",A
BITE BEAUTY,PUR√©E,Lipstick,"a rich, coppery red with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that spread evenly across the lips without streaking. There was a slight amount of lipstick that welled in my lip lines, though the shiny finish and richer color made it less apparent in person. The consistency was lightweight, comfortable to wear, and lightly tacky. It lasted for five hours and was hydrating over time.",A
WET 'N' WILD,BOTANIC DREAM,Highlighter,"a medium, rosy pink with stronger, warm undertones and a frosted sheen. The finish was more metallic as I diffused and blended out the powder on the skin, but it did not seem to accentuate the look of my skin‚Äôs natural texture.",A-
WET 'N' WILD,PEARLESCENT PINK,Blush,"a brighter, medium pink-coral with a golden shimmer. After blending out the powder, the finish was more of a satin sheen.",B
MAC,SAINT NO ANGEL,Palette,"travel-sized lipsticks and lipglosses (two of each) in shades of peach/mauve‚ÄìI liked that the set was more two duos in a box. In the past, MAC has released lip kits that featured full-sized products at a higher price tag, and I‚Äôm digging the travel-sized shades with the more palatable $26.50 price tag. Each Lipstick is 0.06 oz. (full-sized is 0.10 oz.) and each Lipglass is 0.08 fl. oz. (full-sized is 0.10 fl. oz.), which puts the value of the set at $47.60: $20.40 worth of lipstick and $27.20 worth of lipgloss.",A-
SEPHORA,DUSK,Highlighter,a soft pink with warm undertones and golden shimmer. It has a luminous finish‚Äìglowing but not metallic or too reflective.,B+
SEPHORA,EDITORIAL,Palette,"28 eyeshadows in vibrant hues and varying textures. This palette is definitely more of a complementary palette than a standalone one; it will work best paired with more cohesive palettes (like the Cool or Warm palettes), though of course, it can be used on its own. It will just be a lot more versatile when used alongside other palettes! I think that this palette is usable with primer and is best with a very light or white base to ensure the truest color payoff and intensity for the majority of brighter matte shades.",B
NYX,BLOODY MARY,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, pink-red with very strong, blue undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage with a half a layer more on top. The lipstick had more of a velvety feel and was slightly firmer in the tube compared to others in the range, and it seemed to cling more noticeably on. This shade wore well for over six hours, left a stain behind, but was moderately drying to me.",B+
NYX,PERFECT RED,Lipstick,"a medium red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. The lipstick had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which applied evenly across the lips and never tugged or dragged. The consistency was just barely creamy, which made the lipstick feel lightweight and thin on the lips, but it wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable or clingy while worn. It stayed on well for over six hours, left a stain behind but was somewhat drying after four hours of wear.",A-
NYX,EDEN,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, pinky red with cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It was richly pigmented with a lightly creamy texture that wasn‚Äôt too thin nor too thick. The texture was just creamy enough to apply without tugging but did not slide around. There was a smidgen of color that gathered in my deepest lip line but was not noticeable from a normal viewing distance. On me, the color lasted for over six hours, left a stain behind but was lightly drying over time.",A
BITE BEAUTY,INFUSE,Lipstick,"a deep, reddened plum with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish with moderate shine. It was richly pigmented and covered the lips with even color in a single layer. The consistency was lightweight, smooth, and creamy enough to spread easily but did not slide around. It was just a touch tacky but never felt thick or goopy on the lips. The formula was lightly hydrating over the six hours this shade lasted for.",A
BITE BEAUTY,MARSALA,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, purpled berry with subtle, warm undertones and a glossy, cream finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff that applied evenly for the most part, but there was slight unevenness along the center of my lips and a bit of color that settled into my deeper lip lines. The texture of this shade was more emollient compared to others and had noticeable slip. I did not personally experience any feathering along the edges, though. The liquid lipstick wore well for five and a half hours, left a slight stain behind, and was lightly moisturizing over time.",B+
WET 'N' WILD,BLOSSOM GLOW,Highlighter,"a very pale, whitish pink with warmer undertones and a metallic sheen. It almost read beige on my skin tone at times, and I thought it might have had a duochrome shift but not so much.",B+
SEPHORA,DAWN,Highlighter,"a light-medium gold with strong, warm orange undertones and a sparkling, frosted finish. I felt like it did not appear as chunky or as sparkly applied and blended out on the skin as it did just swatched (the skin of my arm is much drier than my face, though).",B+
NARS,ANGEL PRIDE,Palette,"four limited edition blushes (Angel Pride I through IV) along with permanent shades Hot Sand (blush) and Laguna (bronzer). The palette itself contained quite a bit of product, so there‚Äôs no worry about it not being value-packed. My concern was that the texture of the palette throughout felt stiffer, thinner, and drier compared to most of NARS‚Äô standalone powder blushes/bronzers. All but one shade (Angel Pride III) applied fairly well to my cheeks and were not difficult to blend out, but I was expecting a more refined texture from NARS.",B-
MAC,BABY BE COOL,Palette,"travel-sized lipsticks and lipglosses (two of each) in shades of pink. In the past, MAC has released lip kits that featured full-sized products at a higher price tag, and I‚Äôm digging the travel-sized shades with the more palatable $26.50 price tag.

KAT VON D,GLIMMER,Palette,"12 eyeshadows in shimmery finishes with varying amounts of shimmer from a more satin-like sheen to glitter. Per the brand, the ‚Äúvelvety powder is blendable and buildable‚Äù with ‚Äúlong-wear.‚Äù The palette features ‚ÄúGlimmer Topcoats,‚Äù which are the most sparkly shades in the palette. The brand did not mention anywhere in the online marketing that they could be used with a dampened brush, though I saw no ill-effects of doing so within my own palette.",B
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,FILMSTAR,Palette,"a bronzer and blush housed in side-by-side pans. Per the brand, it includes a ‚Äúnatural bronze hue‚Äù while the blush adds a ‚Äúlimitless glow.‚Äù The two worked well together, but the bronzer is quite light and was subtle on my skintone so this might be more suitable for lighter complexions if wanting to use the bronzer as a bronzer. (I liked the bronzer as a soft highlighter, which would work on light to medium skin tones.) The duo was lovely overall, but I wish the brand thought to include a deeper version or had gone with a more medium-hued bronzer that might work for more complexions. There was a brush included, which was serviceable but nothing noteworthy and not something I‚Äôd use as it was somewhat scratchy and prone to shedding.",B+
NYX,BIKER BABE,Lipstick,"a deep red with subtle, warm undertones and a metallic finish. It was intensely pigmented with a smooth, mousse-like texture that spread evenly across the lips and did not feel clingy. There was a bit of color that dried down and sat in my deepest lip line. This shade wore nicely for six hours and was a bit drying.",A
NYX,MODERN MAVEN,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark rosy plum with neutral-to-warm undertones and a metallic sheen. The color payoff was nearly opaque, while the liquid lipstick felt smooth, lightweight, and mousse-like‚Äìnot runny but not heavy either with an airy feel overall. It applied evenly for the most part, but there were some areas that could have been evener. The color stayed on well for six hours and was lightly drying.",B+
NYX,EGO,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark purple with subtle, cool undertones and a pearly sheen. It had good color payoff, but it just did not apply evenly and had a tendency to lift as I tried to even out the color. It ended up looking patchy, and a second layer made every line on my lips appear even more exaggerated than they were with just one layer of product. This shade seemed to have a thicker consistency that took a bit longer to dry down. I thought it would flake off as it wore, but while it felt like it would, it did not and lasted fairly well for five hours, though it was drying.",C
PRETTY VULGAR,NIGHTINGALE,Palette,"12 eyeshadows in an arrangement of soft, neutral shades with a cooler, grayer tones. The palette is made out of sturdy cardboard and has a large mirror underneath the lid. The eyeshadow formula is supposed to be ‚Äúultra-smooth, color-rich, blendable‚Äù that is ‚Äúlong-wearing‚Äù and ‚Äúsupremely creamy.‚Äù My experience with these as hit or miss; some shades were amazing but others were hard to work with. I have no idea how the brand managed to make such a poor beige eyeshadow!",B-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,GLAMBITION,Palette,"a warm-toned, neutral combination of colors with a slightly smokier leaning. It featured seven shades with four different finishes (velvet, satin, silk and lam√©). The eyeshadow formula is supposed to have ‚Äúlasting, velvety-rich pigment.‚Äù I liked the palette overall, but I wish the deepest shade was more blendable as the rest of the palette was pigmented, blendable, and long-wearing.",A-
MAYBELLINE,GOLD (300),Highlighter,"a medium, yellow gold with warm undertones and fine pearl. This shade had the finest shimmer of the three released, which made for a better all-over glow product as it did not look like distinctive particles scattered over the skin and yielded a luminous sheen instead.",B+
NYX,SWEET PINK,Lipstick,"a dark magenta pink with cool undertones and a satin finish. It had good color coverage, though it was not quite opaque, that applied evenly across the lips and did not drag. The texture felt thinner but was still creamy enough to be comfortable on. There was slight color that pulled into my deeper lip lines. It wore well for five hours and a left a stain behind with the formula being slightly drying.",B+
NYX,STREET CRED,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. It was intensely pigmented and had a very smooth, lightly creamy texture that wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin, which made it sit nicely on the lips and apply without lots of streaking. It wore well for five and a half hours and was a little on the drying side after four hours of wear.",A
NYX,ANGEL,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which applied evenly and smoothly without tugging on the lips. The consistency was lightweight, thin without being clingy, and it sat well on the lips. This shade wore well for five and a half hours and was slightly drying.",A-
SEPHORA,COOL,Palette,"28 eyeshadows in a ‚Äúcool‚Äù color story. I would describe it as more of a neutral-to-cool palette; there were a few warmer shades in the palette, but there were a lot of more mauve, pink, and muted shades. While 28 shades is a lot, I was surprised that there was some overlap in the pink shades, and it didn‚Äôt seem as versatile to me as I was using it to come up with different color combinations (merely an observation and has no impact on the rating). There were a couple severe misses in the palette coupled with a lot of so-so quality eyeshadows that made this palette underwhelming at the end.",C+
NYX,NEW ERA,Lipstick,"a dark bronze with warm undertones with a metallic sheen. It had rich pigmentation that covered the lips with smooth, even color coverage. The texture was thin, a little more emollient and ‚Äúwet‚Äù in feel compared to other shades in the range, though still more of a mousse consistency than a liquid. There was a small amount of product that sat in my deeper lip lines as it dried down. It wore well for five and a half hours on me and was slightly drying over time.",A-
NYX,NEAT NUDE,Lipstick,"a dark, taupe-brown with subtle, warm undertones and a fine, metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly on the lips, and there was a smidgen of color that gathered in my deeper lip lines as it dried down. The consistency was thin, lightweight, and dried down quickly to a mostly matte, transfer-resistant finish. This shade stayed on well for five hours and was a bit drying.",B+
NYX,GO ROGUE,Lipstick,"a deep black with cool undertones and a pearly sheen. It had nearly opaque color coverage that applied evenly on the lips and dried down with minimal settling in my lip lines. The consistency was airy, lightweight, and more mousse-like than liquid, as it didn‚Äôt pool or run, but it still spread easily across my lips. It wore well for five and a half hours and was a touch drying overall.",A-
MAYBELLINE,NUDE GLOW (200),Highlighter,"a medium copper with warm, reddish undertones and golden shimmer. It had medium coverage, which could be sheered out slightly but it did not build up much beyond medium for me.",B
BITE BEAUTY,NEARLY NEON PINK,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink with cool, blue undertones and a cream finish. It was richly pigmented with a very smooth, lightweight, and creamy consistency. The lipstick was comfortable to wear, never tugged during application, and didn‚Äôt pull into lip lines. This shade wore well for five hours and was moderately hydrating.",A
BITE BEAUTY,NEARLY NEON FUCHSIA,Lipstick,"a medium-dark raspberry pink with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage in a single layer, but there was a hint of translucency. The texture was lightweight, thinner than the average Amuse Bouche shade (and less emollient), and sat well on the lips. This shade stayed on well for over six hours and left a stain behind.",A
KAT VON D,SAINT,Palette,"a limited edition set that was available for 48 hours. Now, normally the Everlasting sets seem to be a way to preview shades that will be released in full later on, but per the brand‚Äôs Facebook, they stated it was ‚Äúan exclusive shade that won‚Äôt be available after the flash sale is over.‚Äù It seems bizarre, since the set was to celebrate the relaunch of the brand‚Äôs Saint and Sinner fragrances, and it would seem fitting to have coordinating liquid lipsticks. I thought it was going to come back, so I tested it as soon as my order arrived, but I guess this post just serves to provide dupes‚Ä¶",B-
MAYBELLINE,IRIDESCENT (100),Highlighter,"a pale pink with subtle, cool undertones and a frosted shimmer. It had medium, buildable coverage in a single layer, which could also be spread and thinned out for sheerer coverage.",B
BITE BEAUTY,NEARLY NEON PEACH,Lipstick,"a brighter, peachy coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was fantastic‚Äìopaque as described‚Äìand applied fairly evenly, though it seemed to emphasize the texture of my lips a bit more than other shades as there was very slight color in my lip lines. The texture was lightweight, slightly firmer in the tube, but it didn‚Äôt tug or drag on the lips. It wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating while worn.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,NEARLY NEON ORANGE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange with warm, red undertones and a satin finish. The texture was creamy without being slippery, slightly thicker than the average shade in the formula but not heavy, and sat evenly on the lips. It had intense, opaque color payoff in a single stroke, and the lipstick applied evenly and never tugged during application. This shade lasted well for five and a half hours and was hydrating over time.",A
NARS,STARWOMAN,Lipstick,"a medium-dark red with neutral-to-cool undertones and a mostly matte finish. It was richly pigmented and had a very fluid, smooth consistency that was easy to spread across the lips for even, opaque coverage in a single layer. It took awhile to dry down; it was mostly dry within a few minutes, but there were small areas that took almost an hour to disappear. It wore well for six hours and was non-drying.",A
NARS,JUST PUSH PLAY,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, reddened copper with warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. The liquid lipstick had opaque pigmentation that drenched the lips in a single layer (I think one pull of product was more than sufficient to cover the lips). The texture was lightweight, comfortable to apply and to wear, and fluid enough that I did have to be careful along the edges to avoid going too far outside my natural line. It wore well for five and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
NARS,UNDER MY THUMB,Lipstick,"a deep, reddish plum with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. The color payoff was fantastic, while the texture was smooth, lightweight, and fluid on the lips, which made it a cinch to spread the color across the lips for even coverage. Though it has a dry down like a typical liquid lipstick might have, there was a faint tackiness that remained present for most of the wear. It lasted for six hours on me and was non-drying.",A
TARTE,DAYGLEAM,Highlighter,"a light-medium copper with warm, rosy undertones and a metallic sheen. It had rich, opaque pigmentation in a single layer, though the texture was forgiving and a lighter hand (or less dense brush) could be used to achieve sheerer coverage if desired.",A
JOUER,BEVERLY,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a cream finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque, which applied evenly and did not show streaking, but there was a bit of color that had gathered in my deeper lip lines. It had a smooth, creamy consistency that was comfortable and hydrating to wear but remained non-sticky and not overly slippery on the lips. The lipgloss stayed on well for four and a half hours on me.",B+
JOUER,BOND,Lipgloss,"a deep red with cool undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff that covered the lips with even coverage and minimal color that settled into my lip lines (less than the majority of the shades in the range). The texture was lightweight, smooth and a bit creamy, and non-sticky. It wore well for five hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",A-
JOUER,BROADWAY,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark bronze with warm, red undertones and fine copper pearl. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that spread easily across the lips and yielded even application. There was a touch of color that settled into my deeper lip line noticeably but was less noticeable everywhere else. The gloss was lightweight, creamy, and hydrating over the four hours it lasted for.",B+
NYX,BUZZKILL,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark fuchsia with cool undertones and flecks of sparkle over a satin sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly, and the thin, moussy texture made it easy to spread the product across the lips without the color pulling into lip lines. It wasn‚Äôt particularly metallic, though. This shade wore well for six and a half hours and was lightly drying.",A-
NYX,PURE SOCIETY,Lipstick,"a deep plum with subtle, warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good color payoff, though it was not opaque in a single layer. The liquid lipstick had a thin, mousse-like consistency that was airy and spreadable without being watery or overly fluid. It was easy to work with, but the dry down did seem to emphasize the texture of my lips slightly. This shade stayed on well for six hours and was lightly drying after five hours of wear.",A-
NYX,ACME,Lipstick,"a rich, pinky-red with subtle, cool undertones and a metallic sheen. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that covered the lips with even, smooth coverage. The consistency was lightweight, thin but not watery as it had more of a mousse feel. The color stayed on well for six hours and was lightly drying after four hours of wear.",A
BOBBI BROWN,PEACE,Palette,"a light aqua, silvery green, and pale blue. There are two Sparkle eyeshadows (first and third) and one Shimmer Wash eyeshadow (second). The Sparkle Eye Shadow finish is supposed to be a ‚Äúfeatherweight‚Äù formula with ‚Äúshimmering pearls and fine sparkle.‚Äù The Shimmer Wash Eye Shadow finish is described as a ‚Äúsheer wash of shimmer.‚Äù I don‚Äôt think this trio is worth even considering unless you‚Äôre someone who loves the brand‚Äôs Sparkle formula and likes them sheerer. This trio was painful to wear ‚Äì my eye was watering nonstop with how much fallout there was as soon as the products were applied. The three shades came together poorly, as they were quite light and offered no contrast and little coverage.",F
HUDA BEAUTY,MYSTICAL,Lipgloss,"a brighter, medium lavender with warmer, pink undertones and cooler, lavender sparkle. It had sheer coverage (and was supposed to have semi-sheer coverage) that applied evenly on the lips. The texture was smooth, lightweight, and forgiving on the lips as it made my lips appear smoother. This shade wore well for four hours and was lightly moisturizing over time.",B+
HUDA BEAUTY,FEARLESS,Lipgloss,"a rich, medium-dark purple with hints of warm, plummy undertones and gold pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which wasn‚Äôt the full coverage that was promised, but it applied without streaking, at least. The texture was prone to settling into lip lines slightly, though I did not notice it from a normal viewing distance. The consistency was lightweight with some tackiness but it was thinner while still being smooth and spreadable. It wore well for five hours on me and was lightly hydrating. The color was very unique, and while imperfect, ended up being one of my favorite shades.",B+
HUDA BEAUTY,MOODY,Lipgloss,"a dark purple with warm, plum undertones and fine multi-colored pearl. It had good color coverage‚Äìjust shy of full coverage‚Äìthat applied evenly and spread easily across the lips. The gloss had a lightweight texture that was smooth, lightly creamy, and just a bit on the tacky side. It lasted well for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A
THEBALM,HOT MAMA,Blush,"a medium, pink-coral with warm undertones and a golden shimmer. It had good pigmentation‚Äìjust shy of opaque‚Äìthat was buildable to full coverage in two layers. The finish was spectacular as it was luminous and smooth‚Äìglowing but never emphasizing.",A+
BOBBI BROWN,LOVE,Palette,"three, warmer neutral shades in shimmery finishes. The first shade was lovely, while the middle shade had a lot of fallout during the day, and the last shade was more pigmented than described (which some may prefer).",B+
JOUER,FIFTH AVE,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium brown with warm, rosy undertones and a cream finish. It had good pigmentation, though it was still shy of full coverage in a single layer. The consistency was lightweight, smooth, and non-tacky, but it did have a tendency to sit in some of my deeper lip lines. I did not feel like the settling was noticeable from a normal viewing distance, as the coverage was even otherwise. This shade wore well for four hours and was llightly hydrating while worn.",A-
JOUER,CHAMPS-ELYSEES,Lipgloss,"Ja soft, medium coral with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation, but it did not apply as evenly as it should have. The texture was almost too emollient, as it settled into my lip lines and showed a bit of streaking. It was comfortable to wear, hydrating, and lasted for four hours on me.",B+
JOUER,MADISON,Lipgloss,"a brighter, medium-dark plum with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage, though there was a translucency throughout so a bit of the natural lip color came through. The gloss was lightweight, creamy without being heavy, and comfortable to have on the lips as it wasn‚Äôt sticky and was lightly moisturizing. This shade wore well for four hours.",B+
URBAN DECAY,FIREBALL,Highlighter,"a medium, peachy orange with warm, reddish undertones and a fine, pink and gold sparkle. It had sheer color payoff in a single layer, which was buildable to medium coverage with three layers.",C-
NARS,BORD DE PLAGE,Palette,"four highlighters and two bronzers. If you‚Äôre familiar with spring‚Äôs Banc de Sable, then this palette might seem familiar; it has a similar formula and includes one shade from it as well (Rivage). The two bronzers‚ÄìLaguna and Casino‚Äìare still available individually in the Sun Wash formula. The consistency of both the highlighters and bronzers is firmer in the pan with a smoother consistency that doesn‚Äôt kickup excess product in the pan but works better with a denser brush. The Sun Wash bronzer formula is designed to be sheerer, so they will work best for someone who wants a buildable bronzer. The highlighters can be used wet or dry with wet (well, damp) application yielding a stronger sheen and slightly more pigmented, depending on the shade. They are entirely usable dry, though, as they‚Äôre more pigmented dry than described.",B+
NARS,LOW RIDER,Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had excellent pigmentation that covered the lips with smooth, even coverage. The texture was lightweight, thin but fluid (not watery), and spread easily across my lips without streaking or pulling into my lip lines. It dried down a mostly transfer-resistant finish, but if I drank anything, I did get some transfer on my glass, though there was so much pigment that it still lasted for a good five hours on me and was non-drying.",A-
NARS,GET UP STAND UP,Lipstick,"a bold, bright, pinky-red with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. The consistency was very fluid and felt like there was more product on the applicator than necessary to get full coverage, but it still dried down to a mostly transfer-proof finish quickly. I never felt like it fully set, and if I drank or ate, color came off noticeably, but it did feel more flexible on. The formula lasted for six hours well and was non-drying.",A
NARS,LIGHT MY FIRE,Lipstick,"a medium, orange-red with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly, but it did not seem to go on as smoothly as other shades and emphasized the texture of my lips somewhat. The color wore well for six hours and was non-drying.",A-
CIATE,STARBURST,Highlighter,"a light gold with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. It had a high-shine finish even with a sheerer application, though it was not truly metallic until medium or greater coverage.",B
HUDA BEAUTY,FOXY,Lipgloss,"a dark, reddish-bronze with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had rich, opaque coverage (as described) that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. The gloss was lightweight, lightly tacky but very smooth and spreadable, and comfortable to wear. It wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating.",A
HUDA BEAUTY,SAUCEY,Lipgloss,"a rich, medium-dark red with cooler pink and red pearl. It had nearly opaque color payoff, which applied evenly on the lips and did not appear streaky. The gloss spread well over the lips as the texture was thin, smooth, and lightly tacky so it stayed in place and did not slide around. This shade lasted well for five hours and was somewhat moisturizing.",A
HUDA BEAUTY,BOUJEE,Lipgloss,"a medium coral-orange with warm undertones and fine pink and gold pearl. It had semi-opaque, so it wasn‚Äôt as pigmented as described, but the color applied evenly and smoothly on the lips. The texture was lightweight with a bit of tackiness but never felt goopy or truly sticky to me. On me, the gloss wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",B+
MAC,AEROS BLUE,Eyeliner,"a bright, medium-dark blue with strong, cool undertones and a satin sheen. It had medium coverage in a single stroke, and it was buildable to semi-opaque coverage.",C
MAC,BIONIC BAE,Eyeliner,"a blackened blue with cool undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-opaque coverage in a single stroke, which did not build up that well. It seemed to get more uneven and patchy-looking as I tried to build up the color.",B-
MAC,CHROMATBABE SUPER PACK,Palette,"six eyeshadows with satin to frost finishes. It is a deeper, darker, smokier palette with a pop of bright orange and cyan blue. The palette is part of the Chromat collection, which launches today (June 29th) online and at select MAC locations. I suspect that the color combination will appeal strongly to some but will not work for all. It was decent overall, but the lighter blue was a real let down and brought down the palette as a whole.",B
DOSE OF COLORS,MELONADE,Highlighter,"a light-medium, peachy coral with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-sheer pigmentation, which was buildable on the skin for semi-opaque coverage. The consistency was firmer but still that creamier, denser powder that required a heavier hand or denser brush to really buff and blend out the color across the skin for even coverage and diffused edges. On my skin tone, this particular shade had a tendency to disappear so it may not be as detectable in photos as I would have liked but there‚Äôs a hint of color on the apples of my cheeks. The sheen was noticeable but did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. It wore well for eight hours on before fading slightly.",C+
CIATE,MOONDUST,Highlighter,"a soft, light pink with warm, beige undertones and a sparkling, luminous sheen. It had a moderate to intense glow, depending on how heavy the application, and fine sparkle. I didn‚Äôt feel like it read glittery on the skin, but there were larger particles that may not be in keeping with everyone‚Äôs preference.",A-
COLOUR POP,"YES, PLEASE!",Palette,"a new, limited edition palette filled with twelve shades of warm neutrals in a mix of mattes and shimmers. Almost every single shade performed well, was pigmented, long-wearing, and easy to work with (one fell a little short but wasn‚Äôt bad!). The pans were removable, and each one was 0.03 oz. (full-sized eyeshadows are 0.05 from ColourPop), which was plenty of product for a palette without feeling or looking tiny. It released a week or so ago, sold out very quickly, but it will be restocked soon‚ÄìColourPop just postponed the restock date yesterday and hasn‚Äôt announced a new date yet, but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be soon.",A-
MAC,DARE YOU,Lipstick,"a medium-dark red with subtle, warm undertones and ruby red pearl. It had semi-opaque color payoff that applied beautifully to the lips‚Äìsmooth, even coverage that made lips appear softer and more supple. The texture was lightweight with light slip but still adhered well while being comfortable to wear over the five and a half hours it lasted for.",A-
MAC,LADY BUG,Lipstick,"a medium red with warm, yellow undertones and a natural sheen. It had a Lustre finish, which is the brand‚Äôs sheerer coverage finish, so the semi-sheer to medium pigmentation was no surprise. The texture was thin with moderate slip (though it took a second to warm up and start to melt on the lips) that applied without tugging. It wore well for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
MAC,BRAVE RED,Lipstick,"a medium-dark red with warm, yellow undertones and cream finish with very faint pearl. The consistency was lightly creamy with enough slip to give it a natural shine but it did not slide around while I wore it. It had semi-opaque color coverage that applied evenly and did not gather in my lip lines. This shade stayed on well for almost six hours, left a faint stain behind, and was lightly hydrating.",A
MAC,AUGMENTED REALITY,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark orange-red with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied smoothly across the lips. The texture was velvety and smooth, so it did not tug on the lips but still yielded even coverage that adhered well to the lips. It lasted for over eight hours and was lightly drying toward the end of wear.",A
MAC,SHOCKVALUE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium blue with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied without streaking, but there was a lot of visible color in my lip lines. The texture was lightweight with moderate slip, which might have been why there was noticeable settling. It lasted for five hours, left a subtle stain behind, and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B
KEVYN AUCOIN,GOLD,Lipgloss,"a medium gold with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It was a warm-toned gold for sure, but it had browner undertones, which made it less orange-based and should be more flattering across more skin tones. The gloss was light-medium in weight, lightly tacky, and smooth on the lips. It spread well across the lips, yielded nearlly opaque coverage, and lasted for four hours on me. The formula was lightly hydrating while worn.",A-
KEVYN AUCOIN,BRONZE,Lipgloss,"a rich, deep reddish bronze with warm undertones and golden and copper pearl. It had a really complex sheen as the color appeared warmer, more golden and then more fiery, coppery as I moved. It looked more interesting in person and that effect helped minimize the unevenness of the gloss itself. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that did not spread evenly across my lips, and there was color that settled into my lip lines. This shade lasted for four and a half hours and was hydrating over time.",B-
KEVYN AUCOIN,CARBON,Lipgloss,"a blackened purple with subtle, warm undertones and fine gold and violet pearl. It applied mostly evenly with good pigmentation‚Äìjust shy of full coverage‚Äìthat had a much subtler shimmer-sheen finish compared to the rest of the shades in the line-up. I‚Äôm not sure if it actually had less shimmer in it or the deepness of the color covered the pearl. For such a deep shade, I was impressed by how well it applied, even though it wasn‚Äôt perfect. The texture was smooth, light-medium in weight, and just a touch tacky. It wore well for four hours on me and was lightly moisturizing.",A-
MORPHE,JACLYN HILL,Palette,"35 eyeshadows with most of them living within the warm, neutral family, but there were a few pops of color as well. The eyeshadows are supposed to have ‚Äúthe best color payoff‚Äù and ‚Äúamazing application.‚Äù",B-
NARS,SAVE THE QUEEN,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, rosy plum with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had rich color coverage that applied evenly on the lips in a single coat. The texture was lightweight, thin but not watery, and so fluid that I had to be careful about over-applying product in the corners of my lips. This shade wore really well for a solid five hours, but it started to transfer and fade as soon as I took a sip of water, so it only lasted two more hours after that. The formula felt non-drying to me.",A-
NARS,LONDON CALLING,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark purple with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in a single layer, but it could be built up to opaque coverage with a second layer. It applied fairly evenly with the applicator, as the consistency was thin, very fluid, and easy to spread across the lips. While the color dried down quite a bit initially, there was light tackiness for about twenty minutes after application. The color wore well for five and a half hours before starting to break down but faded evenly and was non-drying over time.",B+
NARS,WILD NIGHT,Lipstick,"a deep purple with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. I waited 20 minutes for this to fully dry down before taking a photo, and there was still a slight sheen to it. It had good pigmentation, though it was shy of full coverage, that covered the lips with even color overall. There was room for improvement with respect to the application, but for this type of color, it was impressive nonetheless. The texture was lightweight, thin but not watery, and spread easily over my lips. It wore well for six and a half hours and was non-drying but absolutely transferred while eating/drinking.",A-
MAC,RUSSIAN RED,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark red with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had rich, opaque color payoff that applied evenly across the lips and never tugged during application. The consistency was lightweight, just creamy enough to glide on but not enough to slide around while worn. This shade lasted for over six hours, left a stain behind, and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
MAC,VIVA GLAM I,Lipstick,"a slightly muted, medium-dark red with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. There‚Äôs a hint of brown to it, which gives it a slightly retro vibe. The lipstick felt smooth, lightly creamy as it glided across the lips and delivered even, opaque pigmentation in a single stroke. This shade wore well for six hours, left a faint stain behind, and was non-drying. I can still remember the first time I wore this shade, it was absolutely love‚Äìit was such a beautiful, flattering shade that made me feel so confident.",A+
MAC,COCKNEY,Lipstick,"a brighter, medium red with warmer, yellow undertones and a luminous sheen. It had a Lustre finish, so it had more translucent coverage‚Äìsemi-sheer to medium pigmentation‚Äìthat appeared almost stain-like. The consistency was firmer initially but melted and felt more emollient as I applied it. Not all Lustres wear well for me, but Cockney is one of the more versatile and comfortable to wear shades within that finish for me. It wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",A-
MAC,DUBONNET,Lipstick,"a deep red with warm, brown undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer with a creamy, light-medium thick consistency. It covered the lips evenly and made my lips appear smoother and did not highlight my lip lines. This shade lasted for five and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",A
PERSONA,IDENTITY,Palette,"12 eyeshadows (each is 0.04 oz.) housed in a slim, cardboard palette. The brand is newer and only has only one product (this one!) available, and it is currently out of stock but a restock is coming soon. The brand described the formula as ‚Äúhighly pigmented‚Äù (but then also listed ‚Äúbuildable coverage,‚Äù which is my favorite contradiction but the brand‚Äôs swatches show opaque coverage, so that‚Äôs what I will hold it to). It‚Äôs an excellent eyeshadow palette for someone who likes slightly muted neutrals that are semi-opaque to opaque, long-wearing (around eight hours of wear), and very blendable. The shimmery shades had a tendency to ‚Äúmelt‚Äù on the lid, which made them more flattering on the lid and apply more seamlessly, while the mattes were easy to use. It is a little heavy on the mid-tones, so it may not work for all skin tones; I would love to see the brand release more curated palettes like these, though.",A
DOSE OF COLORS,GOLD IS THE NEW BLACK,Highlighter,"a medium gold with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer and a lighter touch could get sheerer coverage if desired. The consistency was soft to the touch, almost powdery in a way, but it was also denser and more substantial without being firmly packed in the pan. I found that I had better luck applying and blending out the powder with a blush brush than a tapered highlighting brush, which did not seem dense enough for this texture. Once on the skin, the highlighter lasted for eight hours before fading.",B
HUDA BEAUTY,SHAMELESS,Lipgloss,"a rich, coppery brown with pink and copper pearl and larger sparkle. This was one of the few shades that had larger particles in it. The brand described it as having a sheer base, which I found to be true‚Äìthe coverage came primarily from the amount of shimmer/sparkle rather than an actual base color. I could feel some of the sparkles occasionally, but it wasn‚Äôt rough or gritty. The gloss spread well across the lips and lasted for four hours on me. The formula felt hydrating while worn, too.",A-
HUDA BEAUTY,ANGELIC,Lipgloss,"a medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a healthy dose of fine, gold pearl. It had medium coverage‚Äìwhich by the omission of indication of sheer, semi-sheer, or full coverage seemed to imply medium coverage‚Äìthat covered the lips evenly. I had a bit of color that settled into my deeper lip lines but wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance due to the high-shine finish. The gloss wore well for four and a half hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",A-
HUDA BEAUTY,RITZY,Lipgloss,"a light-medium peach with gold, pink, and bronze pearl. It had semi-sheer coverage, which was as described, that applied fairly evenly. There was slight settling into my deeper lip lines, but again, it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance as the finish was incredibly glossy and reflective. It stayed on well for four hours and was lightly moisturizing.",B+
KEVYN AUCOIN,ROSE GOLD,Lipgloss,"a peachy coral with warm undertones and lots of fine, gold pearl (along with pink). I was surprised that it was not more pigmented in a single layer, and while buildable to a point, it did feel a little too heavy with a second layer and was more prone to sliding around so one layer was ultimately the most comfortable. It had medium pigmentation that covered the lips fairly evenly with a high-shine finish. The texture was light-medium in weight with light tackiness and a smidgen of color that pooled in my deepest lip line. This shade lasted for four hours on me and was hydrating.",B
KEVYN AUCOIN,COPPER,Lipgloss,"a golden copper with warm, bronze undertones and multi-colored pearl (though predominantly gold). It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a smooth, creamy consistency that was light-medium in weight, lightly tacky, and comfortable to wear. The gloss spread evenly across the lips and stayed on well for four and a half hours.",A
KEVYN AUCOIN,TITANIUM,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark, taupe-brown with subtle, warm undertones and fine, multi-colored pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly across the lips as it spread well and did not feel too tacky. The texture was smooth, almost creamy going on, but it did not slide around too much. The gloss wore well for five hours and was moisturizing.",A-
BH COSMETICS,CLUB TROPICANA,Palette,"a collection of brighter pops of color in the brand‚Äôs more shimmery formula. I‚Äôve reviewed the Original Foil Eyes and more recent Foil Eyes 2 palettes in the past, and I find that the original is the easiest to work with across the palette, but Club Tropicana was the worst/hardest to use as-is. I think if you‚Äôre someone who enjoys very shimmery, sparkly, or metallic shades and typically works with a dampened brush or an adhesive base, you‚Äôll find this palette useful and easier to use. There were just several shades that required a dampened brush to help improve binding and adhesion (for evenness) to the lid, and for me, traditional eyeshadow primer doesn‚Äôt do much as the issue was more texture/formula than a matter of pigmentation or longevity.",B
BOBBI BROWN,TAWNY GLOW,Highlighter,"a light-medium pink with cooler undertones and warmer pink and gold shimmer along with faint gold sparkle. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that applied evenly to bare skin and blended out without trouble.",A-
J. CAT BEAUTY,SUNRISE GLOW,Highlighter,"a slightly muted, medium gold with warm, brown undertones and a sparkling finish. There were larger bits of sparkle strewn throughout the powder, which made for a rougher texture overall.",B+
NYX,ALABAMA,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark red with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It was richly pigmented with a creamy, smooth consistency that glided on without tugging on the lips and delivered even coverage. The color wore well for over six hours and left a slight stain behind, though the formula was neither drying nor hydrating over time.",A
NYX,MERLOT,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, reddish plum with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips. The texture was lightweight, creamy without being too emollient or slippery, and comfortable to wear. It wore well for just over five hours and was just a touch drying after four hours of wear.",A
NYX,ARIA,Lipstick,"a brighter, medium-dark magenta berry with cooler undertones and a barely-there pearl. The texture was thinner and seemed to have a lot more waxiness to it, which resulted in semi-opaque coverage and less even coverage. The lipstick stayed on well for five and a half hours but was moderately drying over time.",C+
NYX,SIREN,Lipstick,"a deep, reddened berry with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. The consistency was lightly creamy with some slip (more than other shades in the range), which resulted in more of a sheen for the first few hours of wear. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly, though a bit of color pulled into my lip lines over the five hours it lasted on me. The formula was slightly drying after three hours of wear.",B+
J. CAT BEAUTY,PINK GODDESS,Highlighter,"a medium, rosy copper with warm, brown undertones and flecks of larger gold sparkle over a more frosted sheen. The looser sparkle did not translate too noticeably on the skin, and after buffing and blending, it had a luminous sheen that was shy of being metallic (which also meant it did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture!).",B-
MILK MAKEUP,SILENT DISCO,Eyeshadow,"a blackened plum with warm, brown undertones and flecks of plum and pink sparkle. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, but it was hard to control the coverage and evenness on the lid except if I used a fingertip to sheer it out (but then it looked blotchy as this type of color often does at sheerer coverage levels). The larger sparkles seemed to impede the application and made the product lift from the area whenever I tried to even it out. It did not build up well, as it made the dried down texture uneven and chunky-looking. It lasted decently for nine hours but some larger pieces of product started to flake off.",D+
MILK MAKEUP,MERMAID PARADE,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium emerald green with subtle, warmer yellow undertones and cooler, greenish-teal shimmer. When applied in a single layer, it was incredibly pigmented and appeared cooler overall, but the more I blended it out, the yellower the base looked. I was surprised that it looked decent even sheered out, as it did not appear uneven. The texture was creamy enough to spread across the lid but pigmented enough that it remained opaque until I wanted to diffuse the edges. It wore well for twelve hours and still showed no signs of creasing or fading.",A+
COLOUR POP,CANDY FLOSS,Lipstick,"a medium, peachy brown with warm, orange undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had medium to nearly opaque pigmentation‚Äìit was definitely one of the more pigmented shades in the line-up. The lipstick applied evenly and smoothly with a slightly creamier texture compared to other shades, which might have been responsible for the less matte finish as well. There was a smidgen of color that pulled into my deeper lip lines. It wore well for four hours and was non-drying.",B+
COLOUR POP,DRIP,Lipstick,"a muted, medium pink-coral with soft, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-sheer to medium pigmentation that applied evenly and sat well on the lips. The consistency was smooth, almost velvety as it glided on the lips but still felt weightless and thin as it sat on the lips. It stayed on well for four hours and was non-drying.",B+
COLOUR POP,BRAIN FREEZE,Lipstick,"a medium pink with subtle, blue undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-sheer to medium pigmentation that applied fairly evenly, though the edges could have been better and I did have faint color slip into my lip lines. The texture was lightweight, thin but not clingy, and did not tug on the lips after the first second of applying (then it felt quite velvety). It wore well for three and a half hours on me and was non-drying.",B
COLOUR POP,BEE'S KNEES,Lipstick,"a medium-dark raspberry pink with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had medium pigmentation that applied evenly to lips with a smooth, velvety texture that glided on as it warmed up against the lips. This shade lasted for four and a half hours and was non-drying.",A
MAYBELLINE,ELECTRIC ORANGE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange with warm, red undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly to the lips. The lipstick was lightly creamy with moderate slip but did not slide around while worn. I did notice a subtle amount of color that had settled into my lip lines. It wore well for four and a half hours and was moisturizing over time.",B+
MAYBELLINE,ON FIRE RED,Lipstick,"a bright, medium red with cool, pink undertones and a natural sheen. The consistency was incredibly smooth, almost jelly-like as it glided on the lips and delivered even, semi-opaque color coverage that sat well on the lips. This particular shade seemed to give my lips the illusion of smoothness and plumpness. It wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating, and there was a subtle, reddish stain left behind.",A
MAYBELLINE,BRAZEN BERRY,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark magenta purple with warm, pink undertones and a cream finish. It had a noticeable glossiness but did not slide around as it was slightly tacky on the lips, which helped it adhere better to the lips. It had good pigmentation, though it was not full coverage, and the color applied evenly. This shade lasted for five hours on me, left a subtle stain behind, and was hydrating.",A-
MAYBELLINE,PINK POP,Lipstick,"a light-medium pink with cool, blue undertones and a soft, pearly sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly, but there was a bit of color that sunk into my deeper lip lines. The texture was lightweight, thin but not clingy, and had a fair amount of slip. The lipstick stayed on well for four hours on me and was lightly moisturizing.",B
MAYBELLINE,FUCHSIA FLASH,Lipstick,"a bright, medium fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly on the lips. The lipstick was lightweight, moderately emollient, and glided on without tugging. This shade lasted for four and a half hours on me and was hydrating over time.",A-
MAYBELLINE,SHOCKING CORAL,Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium coral-red with warm undertones and a creamy finish. It was just shy of being truly full coverage, but the color applied evenly and smoothly to the lips with just a smidgen of streaking along the edges (which were not noticeable from a normal viewing distance due to the brightness of the color itself). The texture was lightweight with moderate slip, so it didn‚Äôt tug when applied directly from the tube and was comfortable to wear. The formula was hydrating over the five and a half hours the color lasted.",A-
MAYBELLINE,VIVID ROSE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool undertones and a soft sheen. It had good pigmentation that yielded even coverage on the lips, though it took a second layer to get to full coverage. The lipstick felt smooth going on, creamy enough to glide without tugging but not slide around when worn. It lasted for five hours on me and was hydrating.",A
MILK MAKEUP,HOTEL LOBBY,Eyeshadow,"a light, champagne gold with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. The texture was creamy enough to spread easily across the lid but did not feel overly wet or slippery, so it applied with rich, opaque coverage. I felt like this shade was very, very pigmented and a little went a long way (out of all five that I tried). I had no trouble applying this on the lid with a brush, but it worked well as an all over lid color applied with fingertips. On me, the color was still going strong after twelve hours of wear.",A+
MILK MAKEUP,GIG,Eyeshadow,"a rich, coppery brown with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It was intensely pigmented where a little went a long way. The consistency was smooth, creamy without being too wet, and it spread easily across the lid and into the crease. I could buff the edges lightly with a dense, crease brush without a lot of work. It would worked sheered out as an all-over, one-and-done kind of eye look as well. It wore well for twelve hours without creasing or fading on me.",A+
MILK MAKEUP,PEEP SHOW,Eyeshadow,"a medium, purple-taupe with silver and purple sparkle. This was the most glittery shade out of the five I tried, and the only way I could get it to work decently applied all over the lid with fingertips but it dried down and made my lids look wrinkled/very textured. It had semi-sheer coverage that lasted for nine hours without creasing but had large chunks of product/glitter drop while I wore it.",F
LORAC,BEAUTY AND THE BEAST LIP GLOSS COLLECTION,Palette,"five, full-sized lipglosses in hues of pink, coral, and red. The MOD Lip Gloss formula is described as a ‚Äúnon-tacky, moderate-shine gloss.‚Äù The brand made no specific claims with respect to pigmentation level, though they stated that the glosses could be used on top of the lipsticks also released in this collection. Lipgloss is typically not opaque and on average, falls somewhere in the middle‚Äìsome pigmentation/coverage so they can be worn alone but not full coverage, which the standard I held these glosses up to. The coverage varied from sheer to medium with moderate, noticeable shine with a smooth, non-sticky texture. While they were comfortable to wear, they wore away quickly and would need very regular reapplication.",B-
ZOEVA,BASIC MOMENT,Palette,"three cheek products‚Äìa contour powder, blush, and highlighter‚Äìin a slim, cardboard palette. The powders are supposed to be ‚Äúincredibly pigmented.‚Äù The highlighter was the ‚Äúmiss‚Äù in the palette, as it was drier in texture and had sheerer coverage, while the blush and contour powders were pigmented and blendable.",B
LORAC,BEAUTY AND THE BEAST LIPSTICK COLLECTION,Palette,"five, full-sized lipsticks in hues of pink, coral, and red. The MOD Cream formula is described as a ‚Äúcreamy, moderate coverage‚Äù lipstick. I, on the other hand, would describe the MOD Cream formula has a highly pigmented, creamy, and luminous lipstick with wear that varied from three and a half hours to six hours that was hydrating and comfortable to wear. The big ‚Äúdownside‚Äù was that the pigmentation was typically nearly opaque and only one shade was actually ‚Äúmoderate coverage.‚Äù",B+
LORAC,BEAUTY AND THE BEAST,Palette,"three blushes and one highlighter. The palette features the brand‚Äôs Light Source Illuminating Highlighter and Color Source Buildable Blush formulas. The highlighter formula is supposed to be buildable and luminous, but my experience with them was that they were quite pigmented‚Äìsoft enough to blend them out or use a bit less for sheerer coverage, just not what I‚Äôd actually describe as buildable. As you might guess from the name, the blush is supposed to be buildable, but only one of the blushes was on the buildable side while the other two were quite pigmented. If you like your cheek colors to be more pigmented, the palette would work well for you, especially as all four shades were blendable, easy to use, and wore for seven and a half to eight and a half hours for me.",B+
MILANI,PINK PLAY,Palette,"swirled together to create a soft, light-medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a satin sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that applied evenly to bare skin and blended out without issue. The consistency was slightly dusty to the touch but sat well on my skin. The blush lasted for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.",C+
LORAC,BEAUTY AND THE BEAST EYE PALETTE,Palette,"16 eyeshadows that are supposed to be all new and using the brand‚Äôs PRO formula. The eyeshadows felt smooth, finely-milled, and had some powderiness (as a result of being so soft) and felt comparable to past Pro palettes, though I have found that the original Pro palettes seem to have more substance and adhere better (without primer) than newer palettes.",B-
BECCA COSMETICS,TOPAZ FLASHES GILT,Highlighter,"a medium gold with strong, warm orange undertones and shimmer that shifted from gold-to-green. The texture was soft to the touch and a little drier but not in a way that impeded application. It had good pigmentation that applied evenly and blended out without issue, though it emphasized my pores just slightly. This shade lasted for eight hours on me before fading.",A-
BECCA COSMETICS,CHAMPAGNE DREAM FLASHES BELLINI,Highlighter,"a light, yellowed peach with warm undertones and shimmer that shifted from peach-to-pink. The shift was very subtle, though, and the base seemed to have more white to it, so it ended up coming through rather noticeably, which minimized the impact of the shifting shimmer. The consistency was drier, looser in the pan, but it picked up fine on my brush and blended out without trouble. It had a moderate luminosity that did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. The highlighter lasted for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
NYX,TEMPTRESS,LIpstick,"a medium, pink-coral with warmer undertones and a semi-matte finish. This shade had a stronger white base, which seemed to make the lipstick appear lighter on the lips than initially swatched or in the tube. The texture was lightly creamy, comfortable to apply, and did not slide around over time. It had nearly opaque color coverage that went on fairly evenly with just a bit of color that settled into my lip lines after two and a half hours of wear. This shade lasted for four hours and was non-drying.",B
NYX,AUDREY,LIpstick,"a bright, medium pink with subtle, cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly, but there was a bit of ‚Äúcracking‚Äù at my deepest lip line, though I could smooth it out by pressing my lips together periodically. The consistency was lightweight, thin without being dry, and was comfortable to apply as the lipstick did not tug. It lasted for four and a half hours and was lightly drying.",B+
NYX,NATURAL,LIpstick,"a muted, medium-dark plummy mauve with neutral undertones and a satin finish. The lipstick was smooth, velvety, and glided on with ease while delivering nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer. It applied evenly, and I had a smidgen of color pull into my deeper lip lines that was not visible from a normal viewing distance. The color wore well for four and a half hours with some color pulling further into my lip lines after three hours of wear, and the formula felt non-drying to me.",B+
TARTE,RAINFOREST OF THE SEA VOL. 3,Palette,"nine warm-toned, neutral eyeshadows with all but one being highly shimmery/metallic in finish. As the majority of shades were packed with shimmer, most of them appeared lighter in practice than they looked in their respective pans.",B+
BECCA COSMETICS,ROSE QUARTZ FLASHES SEASHELL,Highlighter,"a light pink with a luminous sheen and subtle, warm undertones. It had good color payoff with a soft, smooth consistency that wasn‚Äôt dry but did not seem as finely-milled as Becca‚Äôs more popular highlighting powder formula. This shade was a more subtle shade in the range (though I would classify it as a moderate highlighter in the grand scheme of all that is highlighting), as it did not have the high-shine finish, and it definitely did not have anything like a duochrome shift. This shade lasted for eight hours on me.",A-
BECCA COSMETICS,OPAL FLASHES JADE,Highlighter,"a warmer, light beige with a moderate, greenish-gold shift that became warmer and cooler as the angle changed. The shift was noticeable in person and did not look ‚Äúoff‚Äù in any way but was a delightful reflection and interplay of light and color. It had opaque color payoff with a fairly smooth, soft, and blendable texture, though it was not as creamy as Becca‚Äôs other powder products. It lasted for eight hours on me before fading slightly.",A-
MILANI,BRONZE BURST,Palette,"swirled together to create a medium, orange-copper with warm, red undertones and a faint, golden sheen. It had good pigmentation that was fairly blendable on the skin. When I used all the shades together, the wear time was eight hours.",B-
COLOUR POP,BANANA DAIQUIRI,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium bluish-teal with cooler undertones and warmer flecks of pale gold sparkle. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that maintained its vibrancy after it dried down. The consistency was smooth, blendable, and lightly emollient but not too thick or too wet, so it was easy to apply to bare skin without losing its intensity. The edges diffused nicely, while the color applied evenly. This shade stayed on well for over 10 hours on me with no signs of creasing.",A
COLOUR POP,AS YOU WAVE,Eyeshadow,"a vibrant, deep coral-red with warm, fiery copper shimmer that gave it a more pearlized finish. It had intense pigmentation that applied fairly evenly and smoothly to the lid, though I noticed that it was a bit more emollient than the average Super Shock Shadow. The color blended out with ease and was still going strong after 10 hours of wear.",A
COLOUR POP,DEEP DIVE,Eyeshadow,"medium-dark bronze with warm undertones and flecks of gold and purple shimmer. It had good color coverage, though it was not opaque, paired with a smooth, emollient consistency that wasn‚Äôt too thin or too thick. The eyeshadow applied evenly on bare skin and stayed in place well for 10 hours.",A
BECCA COSMETICS,AMETHYST FLASHES GEODE,Highlighter,"a medium pink with warm undertones and cooler, lavender sparkle and pearl. This shade had larger sparkles that sat on the skin along with finer pearl that gave a more luminous sheen on the skin. The texture was chunky, dry, and had a tendency to appear patchy without a good deal of buffing. It emphasized my skin‚Äôs natural texture, though it was nowhere near as shiny as the brand‚Äôs original pressed highlighters. It had good pigmentation, though, and lasted for seven and a half hours on me. I did not detect much of a shift, more that it had a warmer, pink base with a cooler sheen but no real shift or duochrome-like appearance.",C+
BECCA COSMETICS,PEARL FLASHES GOLD,Highlighter,"a light, white gold with a cooler, white base and a warmer, golden sheen. It had, at most, a slight shift as the white base looked less stark as I tilted my face just so then the gold would reflect more light and make the base appear less white, but it looked very much the same at most angles. The texture was drier, firmer in the pan, though I did not have any trouble blending out the color, I did have to jab at the surface to get decent color coverage. This shade lasted for seven and a half hours on me before fading.",B
GIVENCHY,WANTED CORAL (16),Lipstick,"a medium, reddish-coral with warm undertones and a creamy finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff that was buildable to nearly opaque coverage. The texture was creamy, moderately emollient, and had a tendency to slide around and appear streaky on mee with slightly uneven coverage in places. This shade wore well for three and a half hours but was hydrating.",C+
GIVENCHY,ULTRAVIOLINE (24),Lipstick,"a bright, magenta purple with sublte, warm pink undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmetnation that applied evenly to lips. The lipstick was lightly creamy without being too emollient, so it glided across the lips with ease but did not feel slippery on. It wore well for four and a half hours and left a subtle stain behind. The formula was moisturizing while worn.",B+
GIVENCHY,STREET ROSE (04),Lipstick,"a light-medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and a satin sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly and never tugged on the lips. The texture was creamy with moderate slip, which made it incredibly comfortable to wear and hydrating over time. The color could have sat more flatteringly on the lips, as it had a tendency to gravitate toward my lip lines over the three hours it wore for.",B
GIVENCHY,ROSE NOCTURNE (06),Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark pink with subtle, warm undertones and a satin sheen. It had good color coverage that applied beautifully on the lips with smooth, even color. The consistency was lightweight, creamy without being heavy and not too slippery, so the color stayed in place better than other shades in the range. It wore well for four hours and was hydrating while worn.",A-
GIVENCHY,PURPLE FICTION (07),Lipstick,"a brighter, purpled berry with cool undertones and a satin sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was slightly buildable with a second or third pass, but it was never opaque. The texture was lightweight, creamy with moderate slip, and I could feel it move around a bit on the lips. I did not personally experience feathering with this shade, though that is not something that happens frequently to me. This shade was longer lasting than most and stayed on well for five hours, and it left a subtle stain behind. The formula was moisturizing over time.",B+
MAYBELLINE,SO HOT,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium orange-red with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had good color coverage in a single layer, though it was not full coverage. The texture was light-medium in weight, moderately sticky, but it adhered and sat well on the lips without feathering or settling into my lip lines. The color stayed on well for over six hours and was somewhat hydrating while worn.",A
MAYBELLINE,CLASSIC,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium-dark red with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly to the lips. The gloss was moderately tacky without feeling heavy or goopy, and while it felt more cream-like when I first applied it, a minute or so later it felt more gel-like. I was impressed by how the gloss did not sink into my lip lines and how it did not feather over time. It wore well for six hours and was lightly hydrating. (I have no idea what happened to the applicator; that was how it arrived and it was the only applicator that was wonky.)",A
MAYBELLINE,OBSESSED,Lipgloss,"a deep, reddish-berry with cool undertones and a cream finish. It had good color coverage, though you could see my lip freckle peeking through. The upside was that it applied evenly and smoothly, which was quite the feat for this type of color and format. The consistency was creamy going on initially, but it developed into a more gel-like consistency that was moderately tacky. This shade wore well for six hours and was lightly moisturizing.",A
BURBERRY,DUSTY PINK (406),Lipstick,"a soft, medium pink with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had good color coverage, though it was a touch shy of being opaque, that applied evenly. The consistency glided on without tugging on my lips, but it seemed to ‚Äúsplit‚Äù at my lip lines and look ‚Äúcracked‚Äù (despite not being the type of lipstick that dries down completely!). This shade wore well for four hours and was non-drying.",B
BURBERRY,NUDE (407),Lipstick,"a medium, rosy brown with warm undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque, so just a smidgen of my lip freckle was still visible. The texture was lightweight, thin without being clingy, and velvety as it applied smoothly. It was more forgiving on the lips with respect to my lip lines than Dusty Pink, though there was a bit of color that settled into my deeper lip lines. The color lasted for four and a half hours and was non-drying.",A-
BURBERRY,DARK NUDE (408),Lipstick," a dark, reddish plum with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly on the lips. The formula was lightweight, velvety, comfortable to wear, and non-drying. The texture was thin, so it did not slide or slip easily on my lips, but it wasn‚Äôt clingy. This shade stayed on well for six hours and was non-drying.",A
MAKEUP GEEK,IN THE NUDE,Palette,"nine eyeshadows with four new, palette-exclusive shades (So Pale, Buffed, Creased, Dark Roast) and five shades from the permanent range (two‚ÄìIn the Spotlight and Grandstand‚Äìare Foiled Eyeshadows). It‚Äôs a warm, neutral eyeshadow palette that is good quality: pigmented, blendable, and wore between seven and eight hours. I didn‚Äôt have any major issues applying or using the eyeshadows in practice, and I suspect it would be a workhorse palette for some (that don‚Äôt already have neutral eyeshadows coming out of their ears).",B+
L'OREAL,ALWAYS PEARLY PINK (756),Eyeshadow,"a light-medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and a frosted finish. It had good pigmentation applied dry, which went on the lid evenly and smoothly and required little effort to blend out. It was able to get full coverage when I used a dampened brush, though. The eyeshadow stayed on well for 11 hours before it started to crease faintly, which led to definite, obvious creasing after 14 hours of wear.",B+
L'OREAL,BURST INTO BLOOM (759),Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark purple with warmer, pink undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. It had medium, buildable pigmentation applied dry, whereas using a dampened brush yielded nearly opaque coverage. The consistency was soft, slightly looser in the pot (as intended/expected), and blendable. I noticed that this shade had a tendency to fade slightly after initial application, so it was not as vibrant on as it appeared in the pot. The color stayed like that for a solid 12 hours, and then I could detect more fading. Worth noting, I found the current version (purchased in 2017) to be less metallic compared to my original version from 2014.",C
L'OREAL,ENDLESS SEA,Eyeshadow,"a brighter, medium bluish-teal with cool undertones and a metallic finish. My recent version (purchased in 2017) was so much better than the one I had originally! This version was incredibly pigmented, smooth and blendable, and easy to use. I did not feel like it needed to be used damp to achieve better results at all, as it looked nearly the same between the two application methods (dry and wet). The color lasted well for 13 hours before fading ever-so-slightly.",B+
L'OREAL,GLISTENING GARNET,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark berry with subtle, cool undertones and a frosted sheen. Applied dry, it had semi-opaque, buildable color payoff that wasn‚Äôt quite as shimmery‚Äìmore pearly‚Äìcompared to the damp application, where the coverage was rich and opaque with a more metallic sheen. The texture was soft, looser but not powdery or messy to use, and blendable. It wore well for 14 hours before there was noticeable fading on me.",B
L'OREAL,PURPLE PRIORITY (758),Eyeshadow,"a dark purple with subtle, warmer brown undertones and cooler, more violet-hued shimmer. It seemed to look deeper and cooler-toned when I used it on the lid than when I initially swatched it. It had medium, buildable color payoff when applied dry, and it was rather blendable and easy to work with as well. The eyeshadow was incredibly pigmented when used with a dampened brush. It wore well for 12 hours before starting to fade, and it was only slightly more faded after 16 hours of wear.",C+
L'OREAL,SMOLDERING PLUM,Eyeshadow,"a blackened plum with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. The consistency was slightly dustier compared to other shades, but it was not difficult to use: it still blended out with ease and didn‚Äôt have a lot of fallout during application. It had good pigmentation applied dry, but it looked less intense and a lighter compared to applying it with a dampened brush, where it was opaque and richer in hue. The eyeshadow stayed on well for 14 hours before I noticed some subtle signs of fading.",B
URBAN DECAY,NAKED HEAT,Palette,"includes 12 eyeshadows with a mixture of shimmers and mattes in an array of warmer, more orange and red-based hues. The palette was good overall‚Äìnot perfect‚Äìbut a solid addition to the Naked range, and I suspect that for those who normally use primer, some of the issues I experienced would be resolved. The shimmers felt a little drier but thinner than the average shimmer eyeshadow from Urban Decay, while the mattes were dry but fairly pigmented, buildable, and blendable. It did not have the same luxurious, creamy consistency of the brand‚Äôs best mattes (I‚Äôm recalling something like Spike) but much more pigmented with more substantial texture (and therefore better application, even without primer) than the mattes in the Naked Smoky palette.",B+
URBAN DECAY,TORCH,Eyeliner,"a muted, medium-dark copper with warm, red undertones and a matte finish. It was intensely pigmented and was opaque in a single stroke. The consistency was smooth, creamy without being too waxy or too emollient, so it glided on with ease but did not slide around on the lash line. This shade wore well for ten hours on me with very minimal thinning/fading.",A+
URBAN DECAY,ALKALINE,Eyeliner,"a medium-dark, reddish plum with subtle, cool undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had medium, buildable pigmentation (up to mostly opaque) that applied evenly on the lash line and did not skip. The pencil was smooth and velvety going on, but it had a little more waxiness compared to Torch, which might have been why it wasn‚Äôt as pigmented from the start. The eyeliner lasted for nine and a half hours with minimal thinning.",B+
MAYBELLINE,TEASE,Lipgloss,"a light beige with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that went on without streaking, but the color looked patchy and sank into so many of my lip lines. There was also something about this particular shade‚Äôs formula that made it harder to apply: it was thinner, almost runny, and it was very hard to keep in place, even after it became more gel-like in texture. It wore for four hours but sank further into my lip lines over time. The formula was lightly hydrating, though.",C+
MAYBELLINE,CHARMER,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium pink with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque color payoff, but the creaminess made it sink into my lip lines and look bubbly in the close-up photo, though I don‚Äôt think either issue was that apparent at a normal viewing distance. The texture was moderately sticky, but it wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable nor did it feel thick or goopy on. It wore well for four and a half hours on me and was lightly moisturizing.",B+
MAYBELLINE,UNREAL,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark brown with soft, warm undertones and a cream finish. The pigmentation was good‚Äìjust shy of being opaque‚Äìand applied without streaking, though there was a bit of color that went into my lip lines. I do not think it was visible from a normal viewing distance, just in the close-up photos. The texture was smooth, creamy, and felt a little slippery initially, but it developed a more gel-like texture that adhered well to lips after thirty seconds or so. The gloss felt hydrating over the four and a half hours it lasted for.",A-
URBAN DECAY,FUEL,Lipstick,"a medium-dark peach with warm undertones and a creamy finish paired with a light sheen. It had nearly opaque color coverage that applied evenly, though there was a touch of color that gathered in my deeper lip lines. The lipstick was lightweight, creamy without being too slippery, and felt moisturizing over time. This shade wore well for four and a half hours on me.",A-
BH COSMETICS,FOIL EYES 2 #1,Palette,"28 eyeshadows that are supposed to be ‚Äúultra-shimmer‚Äù in an array of ‚Äúvivid jewel tones, richer neutrals, and more icy options‚Äù [compared to the original Foil Eyes palette]. The formula is described as having ‚Äúintense pigmentation, buttery feel [with a] molten metal finish.‚Äù",A
L'OREAL,ETERNAL BLACK,Eyeshadow,"a dark black with neutral undertones and a silver sparkle strewn throughout. The consistency was smooth, not too powdery nor too firmly packed into the pot, but it had a tendency to work best built up rather than packed on. It had semi-opaque coverage, which was buildable to nearly opaque coverage, but I was only able to achieve a really rich, opaque lid color with a dampened brush or over an eyeshadow primer. This shade wore well for 12.5 hours before there was slight fading.",B-
L'OREAL,ETERNAL SUNSHINE,Eyeshadow,"a bright, light-medium gold with strong, warm yellow undertones and a soft, metallic sheen. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, blendable consistency that was finely-milled but still dense enough that it applied beautifully to bare lids. The eyeshadow lasted nicely for a solid 13 hours before it started to fade a bit, though it still looked quite good after 16 hours (when I removed it).",A-
L'OREAL,GILDED ENVY (755),Eyeshadow,"a smoky, medium-dark green with warm, olive undertones and a glittery, metallic sheen. The texture was looser and had a sparklier feel‚Äìnot truly gritty but not as smooth as other shades in the range. It had semi-opaque pigmentation applied dry, whereas a dampened brush applied nearly opaque coverage, but it had tendency to sheer out a bit when used dry and appear more faded/muted compared to how it looked initially. It wore well for nine hours with some fall out and light fading.",C-
L'OREAL,GOLDEN EMERALD,Eyeshadow,"a vibrant, medium-dark forest green with warmer, olive undertones and slightly cooler green and gold shimmer. It had more of a frosted finish applied dry, which was amplified to a more metallic finish when applied with a dampened brush. It had good pigmentation regardless of application method, but it was truly opaque when used with a dampened brush. The texture was smooth, blendable, and easy to work with on the lid. It wore well for 12 hours before showing a bit of fading, and it was only slightly more faded at the 16th hour of wear.",A-
L'OREAL,LIQUID DIAMOND,Eyeshadow,"a smoky, medium gray with cool, bluish undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation when applied dry, which intensified to mostly opaque coverage when used with a dampened brush. The texture was noticeably sparkly and looser in the pot (even when I used the included tamping device to press it down), so it was messier in the pot and to use on the lid, as it sheered out a bit. This shade lasted for 10 hours on me before it started to fade noticeably, and after 16 hours, it looked decent but not as good as other shades in the range have at the same check in time.",C+
L'OREAL,SILVER SKY (757),Eyeshadow,"a light, bright silver with cool undertones and a sparkling finish. It had sheer coverage, which did not build up much at all, even when I tried using it with a dampened brush or over an eyeshadow primer. The consistency was dry, crumbly, and almost gritty‚Äìit did not feel at all like other shades in the same formula. It was hard to get a good handle on just how long it lasted, as there was little there and so much of it was sparkle: there was a ton of fallout within a few hours of application, and it seemed mostly gone by the six-hour mark.",F
MAYBELLINE,HOT LAVA,Lipstick,"vibrant, medium orange-red with strong, warm undertones and fine red pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied decently, but it could have distributed color more evenly. The lipstick felt smooth, lightweight, and had a more waxy consistency that was really comfortable to apply but made it harder to build up coverage. The color wore well for five hours on me and was non-drying.",B
MAYBELLINE,COPPER ROSE,Lipstick,"a deep berry with subtle, cool undertones and fine red and violet pearl. It had medium color coverage that was buildable to semi-opaque pigmentation. The consistency was smooth, waxy, and glided on without skipping. While I really enjoyed the color, I wish it had applied more evenly and sat less in my deeper lip lines; I think this one would be workable with lip primer or a coordinating lip liner underneath it. It felt lightweight and thin on the lips but not clingy, so it wasn‚Äôt drying while I wore it. This shade lasted for four and a half hours on me.",B
MAYBELLINE,MOLTEN BRONZE,Lipstick,"a deep, reddish plum with subtle, warm undertones and a duochrome finish that shifted from gold to green. It had semi-opaque, buildable color payoff that applied fairly evenly. The texture was lightweight, thin but not clingy, and felt waxy, so while it glided on with ease, it took a bit more layering to build up the coverage. I had a bit of color that pulled into my lip lines over the five hours the lipstick wore for. The formula felt lightly hydrating overall.",B+
MILANI,CORAL BEAMS,Palette,"supposed to be a ‚Äúhigh-impact, buildable blush‚Äù that ‚Äúblends easily‚Äù but simultaneously has ‚Äúrichly pigmented shades‚Äù that can be used alone or together. The top three sections are larger, but only the top section (the one that often has more shimmer) is truly large enough to accommodate the average blush brush. I think it would be more practical to use two or three shades at a time, rather than only one.",B+
MAYBELLINE,ROYAL,Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium-dark purple with warm, pink undertones and a cream finish. It had medium coverage, which was somewhat buildable but not practical‚Äìit felt overwhelming with more than one layer, as the gloss itself was thicker and heavier. One layer was comfortable, as it developed into a more gel-like feel that did not slide around, but two layers made it seem more slippery to me. The gloss pulled into my lip lines and applied unevenly overall. It did wear awhile at six hours, was lightly hydrating, and left a fuchsia stain behind.",C-
MAYBELLINE,MAJOR,Lipstick,"a deep, navy blue with cool undertones and a cream finish. Applied, it looked more indigo, as it was not fully opaque and the natural pink tones of my lip color came through. The gloss has a thicker consistency, which made it less amenable to building up coverage without also feeling heavy and glue-like. It had a tackier quality, but with a single layer, it was still comfortable to wear. With such a deep color like this, the lack of opacity played a role in the unevenness of the application. The color stayed on for six hours and left a fuchsia stain behind, which lingered for hours.",B
MAYBELLINE,SLAY IT,Lipstick,"a deep burgundy with cooler undertones and a cream finish. It had good color coverage, and while it was not opaque, it did apply better than the prior two! It still pulled into some of my lip lines, but I was able to smooth out the application after it ‚Äúset‚Äù into its more gel-like state, which is when I found it most forgiving to work with. The gloss lasted for six hours on me, left a fuchsia stain behind, and was lightly hydrating.",B+
L'OREAL,AMBER RUSH,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, coppery brown with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation applied dry and more opaque coverage damp. The consistency was soft, loosely packed in the jar but more like a pressed eyeshadow than a loose one overall. It applied evenly to bare skin, blended easily along the edges, and stayed in place for 10.5 hours on me before starting to fade, though there was minimal fading from that point to 16 hours (when I removed it).",B+
L'OREAL,BOTTOMLESS JAVA,Eyeshadow,"a deep brown with subtle, warm reddish undertones and very fine copper and bronze micro-shimmer. It had more of a satin-to-pearl finish‚Äìmore of a sheen than a frosted shimmer. It had opaque coverage applied dry as well as damp, but the dampened application made the color appear deeper and richer. The eyeshadow felt slightly thinner and firmer in the pot compared to the more shimmery shades, but it was easy to apply to the lid and blend out. The color started to crease slightly on me after 14 hours of wear.",B+
L'OREAL,BRONZED TAUPE,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark taupe brown with subtle, warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. It was intensely pigmented regardless of application method (dry or damp), and the consistency was soft, smooth, and blendable while still having that hybrid loose-pressed texture that the formula is famous for. The eyeshadow blended out beautifully on the lid and lasted for 16 hours with minimal signs of wear.",A-
L'OREAL,CONTINUOUS COCOA,Eyeshadow,"a sooty, blackened brown with neutral-to-warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. There was a touch of micro-shimmer in the pot, and I could see the effect faintly swatched, but on the lid, it performed and acted a lot like a matte finish eyehadow. It had semi-sheer, buildable coverage (up to mostly opaque) with a slightly dusty texture in the pot. It was fairly blendable but could have been easier to diffuse along the edges. It wore well for nine and a half hours before fading noticeably.",D
L'OREAL,ENDLESS PEARL,Eyeshadow,"a soft beige with warm, yellow undertones and a semi-matte finish. There seemed to be the slightest amount of sheen to the product, though it performed and looked more like a typical matte eyeshadow on the lid. It had good color coverage applied dry or damp, but the softer, looser consistency in the pot made it easy to adjust pressure and brush type for sheerer, buildable coverage if desired. This shade seemed to wear for a solid 10 hours before starting to fade, and it still had minimal fading after 16 hours of wear.",B
L'OREAL,ICED LATTE,Eyeshadow,"a very light gold with warm, yellow undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. It had good pigmentation applied dry, though it was just shy of being opaque unless applied with a dampened brush. The eyeshadow felt soft, loosely packed in the pot but still felt more like a pressed eyeshadow to me. It applied evenly, blended out well, and stayed in place for 12 hours before starting to fade a bit, and after 16 hours of wear, it was still mostly intact for me.",B+
MAYBELLINE,WHITE GOLD,Lipstick,"a soft, golden beige with warm, peachy undertones and a soft, metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which had even coverage on the lips but uneven texture‚Äìit seemed to bunch up i n places and appear almost crumbly at times. The texture was smooth, waxy, and it felt a lot more comfortable than it looked. This shade lasted for three hours on me with some color settling into lip lines over time, while the formula seemed to be neither drying nor hydrating.",C
MAYBELLINE,PURE GOLD,Lipstick,"a rich, molten gold with warm, coppery undertones and a metallic sheen. It had medium pigmentation that was buildable to semi-opaque coverage. The texture was smooth, lightweight, and thin with a waxy feel that made it easy to glide the lipstick across my lips but did not seem to translate color as well. It could have applied more evenly, and the color gravitated toward my lip lines within two hours of wear. The lipstick lasted for closer to four hours on me and was non-drying.",C
MAYBELLINE,COPPER SPARK,Lipstick,"a medium-dark copper with warm, orange undertones and lighter gold, orange, and copper shimmer paired with a soft, metallic finish. It had good pigmentation‚Äìnot quite opaque‚Äìthat applied evenly across my lips. The texture was lightweight, thin but not clingy, and smooth so it never dragged on the lips. It wore well for five hours on me and was non-drying.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,SUNKISSED,Bronzer,"a light, golden brown with a satin finish and soft, warm undertones. It had intense, opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin. The texture was lightweight, finely-milled, and soft without being powdery in the pan.",A
URBAN DECAY,AFTERGLOW,Palette,"a four-pan highlighter palette exclusively available at Ulta. It features four new shades in the brand‚Äôs Afterglow 8-Hour Powder Highlighter formula, which is supposed to be buildable, lightweight, and will give the ‚Äúperfect glow.‚Äù A full-size Afterglow Highlighter retails for $26 and contains 0.23 oz. or costs $113.04/oz. The palette contains $72.35 worth of product (or comparatively, the palette costs $53.13/oz.).",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,BURNISHED,Bronzer,"dark brown with subtle, warm olive undertones‚Äìit had a stronger muted, yellow undertone‚Äìpaired with a mostly matte finish. The new, powder bronzing formula is supposed to give the skin a ‚Äúsun-kissed glow‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt say much else. It had rich color payoff where a little went a long way, but the powder had a smooth, finely-milled feel to it that made it easier to control how much product transferred onto the brush to avoid over-applying.",B+
MAC,IONIZED IRIS,Lipstick,"a bright, medium fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a mix of finer pink shimmer and larger fuchsia sparkle. The consistency was fairly smooth‚Äìthough I could feel some of the shimmer/sparkle in it as I glided it across my lips‚Äìand had some slip but did not feel slippery on the lips. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that applied evenly onto my lips and sat well on them without getting into my lip lines. The color lasted well for four hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",B+
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,PILLOW TALK,Lipstick,"a muted, medium pink with warmer undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had medium, buildable color coverage‚Äìup to mostly opaque‚Äìwith a velvety, smooth, and thin consistency that clung a bit to lips, though not in an uncomfortable, drying kind of way. I just felt like it had a tendency to emphasize my lip lines a bit as some color pulled into them.",A-
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,PILLOW TALK,Lipstick,"a dusty, medium-dark pink with a hint of mauve paired with a flat, matte finish. It had good color coverage in a single stroke, and it was nearly opaque when I used it to fill-in my lips.",A-
JOUER,FROST BITE,Lipgloss,"a clear base with silver, gold, and violet particles of shimmer and sparkle. It had sheer coverage, which was as described, that applied evenly across the lips. There was a nice amount of shimmer all over the lips, and it had a strong, mirror-like shine. The consistency was lightweight, smooth without being gritty, and felt like a cross between balm and gloss. The color wore well for three hours on its own but was hydrating over time. The formula has a sweet, sugary scent.",B+
JOUER,ROSE GOLD,Lipgloss,"a muted, golden copper base with flecks of pink, gold, and copper sparkle. The texture felt slightly grittier due to the larger sparkles in it, though the base itself was more emollient and a little oily initially. The sparkly bits spread well across the lips for even distribution. It wore well for three hours and was hydrating over time.",B+
COLOURED RAINE,FASHION SHOW,HIghlighter,"a very light, yellowish white with a soft sheen that shifted from gold to pink. It seemed rather similar to Luxurious Bling swatched as well as applied to me, but it had a better texture as it felt smoother, soft without being powdery. It had semi-opaque to opaque, buildable pigmentation that applied evenly to bare skin and diffused easily along the edges. The highlighter started to fade noticeably after eight and a half hours of wear.",A-
PRETTY VULGAR,EARLY BIRD,Palette,"12 eyeshadows in an arrangement of soft, neutral shades with a peach/pink leaning. The palette is made out of sturdy cardboard and has a large mirror underneath the lid. The eyeshadow formula is supposed to be ‚Äúultra-smooth, color-rich, blendable‚Äù that is ‚Äúlong-wearing‚Äù and ‚Äúsupremely creamy.‚Äù I was less impressed with this palette compared to the Prettie Birdie palette. This one had several shades that had more medium to semi-opaque pigmentation with only a handful that were truly pigmented. Many of the eyeshadows in this palette were powdery or dusty, which led to shorter wear and more difficult application.",B-
MAC,METALWORK,Lipstick,"a light, beige-leaning gold with fine silver and gold pearl. It appeared slightly ‚Äúcooler‚Äù with how much beige was on it, but it was still more gold than beige. The lipstick was smooth, lightweight, and thin, and it glided on with ease and did not tug, but there was some unevenness in places and some color that had gathered in my lip lines. I could see this working better layered with another lip color, as it had semi-sheer to medium coverage. On me, it lasted for three and a half hours and was non-drying.",C+
MAC,ROSE DIPPED,Lipstick,"a medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. It had medium, buildable coverage (up to semi-opaque coverage) that applied evenly across the lips without tugging. The consistency was thin and balmy, where I could feel the shimmer as it applied, but it was comfortable to wear overall. It wore well for three and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",B
MAC,WILD NECTAR,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark berry with cool undertones and fine pink and fuchsia pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a smooth, lightweight consistency that went on easily and felt almost like a balm, as it was thinner but still had some slip. The color applied evenly and sat well on the lips with good wear time (four hours). The formula was very slightly moisturizing.",B+
PRETTY VULGAR,PRETTY BIRDIE,Palette,"12 eyeshadows in an arrangement of brighter, more colorful hues in a variety of finishes. The palette is made out of sturdy cardboard and has a large mirror underneath the lid. The eyeshadow formula is supposed to be ‚Äúultra-smooth, color-rich, blendable‚Äù that is ‚Äúlong-wearing‚Äù and ‚Äúsupremely creamy.‚Äù The palette was fairly good‚Äìnot perfect but surprisingly workable without a primer‚Äìwith semi-opaque to opaque pigmentation, slightly dusty textures, and six to eight-hour wear. If you normally wear eyeshadow primer, a lot of the issues iron themselves out.",B+
COLOUR POP,CHIC-Y,Palette,"one of two, limited edition palettes from the collaboration with iluvsarahii. I really feel like ColourPop has improved their powder eyeshadow formula from its initial launch, as their mattes are still very blendable and pigmented but seem smoother and less messy/powdery. While more basic in overall color scheme, the colors came together well and were of good quality, so if you‚Äôre in need of a warm-toned, neutral eyeshadow ‚Äúquad,‚Äù this might be one to check out.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,TAWNY,Bronzer,"a muted, medium-dark brown with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good color coverage in one layer, though it was easily diffused and sheered out if desired. The consistency was smooth, finely-milled, and almost cream-like without being too dense or too softly pressed into the pan. The new, powder bronzing formula is supposed to give the skin a ‚Äúsun-kissed glow‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt say much else. The powder sat well on the skin and had a subtle, natural finish rather than totally matte but did not read shimmery. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.",A-
JOUER,SKINNY DIP,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium gold with warm undertones and flecks of gold and pink shimmer. It had sheer coverage that applied fairly evenly with good disperson of shimmer/sparkle across the lips. (The Lip Topper formula can be used alone or over a lip product, and it is designed to be a sheerer product.) There was a bit of product that settled into my deeper lip lines, but the shinier, sparklier finish made it less noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The formula felt thin, balmy, and a little oily to me with three-hour wear that felt hydrating over time. The Lip Topper formula does have a sweet, sugary scent.",B+
JOUER,TAN LINES,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark, coppery bronze with warm, yellow undertones and flecks of gold and copper sparkle. The consistency was smooth, lightweight, and comfortable to wear, though it had moderate slip and felt a little oily compared to the typical gloss (it almost felt like a hybrid between a gloss and a lip balm to me). It had semi-sheer pigmentation that applied without streaking, but there was some color that had gathered in my lip lines. I thought the product looked better in practice, or in real life, as the shimmer reflected the light and imperfections were less noticeable. This shade wore well for three and a half hours on me.",B+
COLOURED RAINE,LUXURIOUS BLING,HIghlighter,"a pale white with a peach to pink duochrome shift. The consistency was soft but powdery, and it looked slightly chalky against my skin tone when I tried it. When I layered it over a more noticeable blush or bronzer, then I could enjoy the shift without the base coming through so much. It had semi-sheer, buildable pigmentation (up to semi-opaque) that lasted for eight hours on me before turning patchy.",C+
COLOURED RAINE,NO FLASH NEEDED,HIghlighter,"a bright, white gold with a cooler, white base and warmer, greenish-gold shimmer. It had good pigmentation that applied evenly to bare skin and blended out with ease. The consistency felt denser and firmer in the pan, but it also felt creamy‚Äìmore like silicone-based eyeshadow formulas that have become more popular over the last couple of years. I‚Äôve found that this type of formula works best with denser brushes rather than a really soft, feathery brush or an ultra-light hand. The white base of this shade was noticeable, so it sometimes looked grayish against my skin tone; for me, I would pair it with a blush or bronzer to make it work (in terms of color). This shad stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me.",B+
MAC,CORAL OPTIX,Lipstick,"a bright, medium red with strong, warm orange undertones and pink, gold, and copper shimmer that give it a more metallic finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that applied evenly across the lips and never tugged during application. The consistency was smooth, lightweight, and dense enough not to feel gritty (with all of the shimmer/sparkle). It wore well for five hours, left a faint stain behind, and was lightly hydrating.",B+
MAC,FORBIDDEN ROMANCE,Lipstick,"a slightly muted, medium-dark plum with warm, brown undertones and pink and gold pearl. It had medium, buildable color payoff that glided on easily and yielded even coverage. The lipstick was lightly emollient with some slip but did not feel thick or heavy, so it did not slide around once applied. It wore well for four and a half hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",B+
MAC,LOVE'S A GAMBLE,Lipstick,"a light pink with warm, yellow undertones and silver, pink, and gold pearl and sparkle. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly to lips. The texture felt grittier compared to other shades as there was quite a bit of sparkle, while the lipstick base seemed thinner and moderately emollient. The lipstick wore well for three and a half hours on me and was non-drying.",B-
CHANEL,TALPA (14),Eyeshadow,"a light-medium, golden brown with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. The consistency was finely-milled, soft, and lightly dusty in the pan, but it adhered well to bare skin when patted on. I had no trouble diffusing and blending out the edges. It had great pigmentation that lasted for seven hours on me.",B+
CHANEL,NOIR SATIN (26),Eyeshadow,"a blackened purple with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It appeared grayer and blacker in the pan but pulled rather warm and purply on me when swatched. The texture was thinner, a little dusty in the pan, but was blendable on the lid and didn‚Äôt sheer out too readily. The eyeshadow started to fade on me after seven and a half hours of wear.",B+
CHANEL,DESERT ROUGE (36),Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark coppery red with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had good pigmentation with a soft, smooth consistency that blended out with ease. On me, the eyeshadow faded noticeably after seven hours of wear.",B+
COLOURED RAINE,YOUR TREAT,HIghlighter,"a medium-dark, coppery brown with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, blendable texture that was dense but not difficult to pickup product from with a variety of highlighting brushes (fan, tapered, more blush-like). The powder sat beautifully on the skin and gave a reflective shine that did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. The color wore well for nine hours before fading on me.",A
COLOURED RAINE,WATCH ME WERK,HIghlighter,"a rich, deep copper with strong, warm orange undertones and a frosted, metallic sheen. It had good color payoff that was buildable to full coverage with two layers. The highlighter was denser in the pan and had larger shimmer particles in it, so it appeared more shimmery and frosted on the skin than purely shiny compared to some of the other Focal Point Glowlighters. I would recommend using a slightly denser brush with this shade, as more feathery brushes did not pick up product as well. I used a blush brush to apply, and I had no trouble getting good coverage that still blended out easily. This shade started to fade on me after nine hours of wear.",B+
COLOURED RAINE,CUTIE PIE,HIghlighter,"a light-medium pink with warmer undertones and cooler, lavender pearl. It had medium pigmentation, which was buildable to semi-opaque coverage with two layers. The texture was chunkier and did not seem as finely-milled as most shades in the range, and it was quite dense. I had to use a heavier hand with a blush brush to get medium coverage with one swirl in the compact. The color shifted from a pinkish white to a more noticeable pinkish hue on my skin tone, depending on the angle and how the light was reflecting off of my cheeks (that is why you‚Äôll see two full face photos with shade as it was such a dramatic shift). The highlighter lasted for eight and a half hours on me.",B-
COLOURED RAINE,LAVENDER DREAMS,HIghlighter,"a light, lavender purple with cool, violet undertones and soft, pearly sheen. It had medium, buildable pigmentation‚Äìup to semi-opaque‚Äìwith a smooth, blendable consistency that was slightly denser and firmer in the pan. With a tapered highlighting brush, I had no trouble applying and blending out the highlighter but a fan brush would be too feathery for the formula. Despite being rather reflective on the skin, it did not seem to emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading.",B
ANASTASIA,AMBER,Lipgloss,"a medium, peachy brown with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly without streaking but a bit of color gathered in some of my deeper lip lines. The consistency felt smooth and spreadable with a light tackiness that helped it adhere well to the lips but still felt comfortable. This shade wore well for four and a half hours and was hydrating while worn.",B+
ANASTASIA,ST. TROPEZ,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark plum with subtle, cooler undertones and a ton of warm, gold shimmer. Depending on the lighting, it sometimes appeared warmer (due to the way the shimmer caught the light) and cooler (when less of the shimmer was reflecting). It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly on the lips. The gloss was lightweight, smooth, lightly tacky, and comfortable to wear. It lasted for four and a half hours on me and felt hydrating.",A-
ANASTASIA,TOFFEE,Lipgloss,"a soft, medium-dark brown with subtle, warm undertones and barely-there pearl. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly to the lips without streaking, though there was noticeable color in some of my lip lines. The consistency was creamy, smooth, and lightly tacky without feeling heavy or goopy. It wore well for four and a half hours on me and was moisturizing while worn.",B+
JOUER,ST. TROPEZ,Lipgloss,"a sheer base with fine pink and silver pearl and larger pink flecks of glitter. The consistency was thin with a fair amount of slip‚Äìit felt a little oily (and it is advertised as being ‚Äúwith coconut oil‚Äù)‚Äìbut the glitter and shimmer spread evenly across the lips, which I always find to be key in a sheerer, shimmery gloss. I could feel some of the sparkly bits on the lips. The Lip Topper formula can be used alone or over a lip product, and it is designed to be a sheerer product. It was sheerer than Tan Lines but like a warmer, pinker version of Frost Bite. This shade wore well for three hours on its own and was hydrating.",B+
JOUER,PAMPLEMOUSSE,Lipstick,"a medium, rosy copper with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that applied evenly to lips. It dried down a transfer-proof finish, but it emphasized my lip lines slightly. On me, the color stayed on for five and a half hours and was non-drying.",A-
COLOUR POP,BIRTHDAY,Palette,"a cream blush, four powder eyeshadows, and three glosses. The set will be available at 10AM PST today (May 26th) for $35. If you‚Äôre a fan of ColourPop and like these types of shades, it‚Äôs certainly worth considering as the products were consistent in quality as I‚Äôve experienced with these formulas in the past!",A-
CHANEL,LILAS D'OR (808),Eyeshadow,"a soft, light-medium pink with subtle, cooler undertones and warmer, golden pearl. It had semi-sheer coverage, which was only buildable to medium coverage, but it seemed creamier than other shades, so it was also more forgiving during application as it took a bit longer to dry down. I had more time to work with it, and it seemed more blendable in practice as a result. I could see it working best as a one-and-done lid color or as an eyeshadow base. It wore well for 14 hours, and even at that point, it did not look any different.",B
CHANEL,OBSCUR (816),Eyeshadow,"a deep black with neutral-to-cool undertones and barely-there bluish-teal pearl. It looked more matte on the lid than it did shimmery, but I think that satiny sheen helped it blend out more smoothly. The consistency was smooth, creamy with noticeable slip but did not feel greasy or wet to the touch. It applied well when pressed and lightly pulled on the lid for all over coverage, but it was harder to diffuse and blend out the edges as it dried down quickly and had a tendency to look uneven and ragged along the edges, even when I worked quickly. Once on, the eyeshadow did not budge or fade over a 14 hour period.",B+
CHANEL,SILVER PINK (814),Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark brown with warmer undertones and pink and gold sparkle. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage without having to wait for the initial layer to dry down. The texture was smooth, not too thick or too thin, and lightly creamy, which helped it apply evenly to bare skin and blend out decently. The edges were not as blendable once it dried down, but I was able to apply an even layer of product onto the lid without trouble. The eyeshadow still looked fully intact after 14 hours of wear.",B+
MAC,SPOTLIGHT ME,Lipstick,"a light-medium, peachy-coral with warm undertones and a satin sheen. The lipstick was creamy with some slip but did not feel overly slippery on the lips, so it did not slide around or feel like a high maintenance product. It had good pigmentation that covered the lips evenly, though it was shy of being truly opaque on me. There was a smidgen of color that sat in my deeper lip lines but was not noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The color stayed on well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",A-
MAC,YONI CRUSH,Lipstick,"a brighter, medium-dark red with neutral-to-warm undertones and fine gold and pink pearl over a creamy finish. The color coverage was semi-opaque and buildable to mostly opaque coverage, though my lip freckle peeked through at all times. The consistency was creamy, smooth, and emollient without being too slippery, as I felt there was a touch of tackiness that helped the lipstick to adhere well to the lips and helped it to not feather or bleed on me. It lasted for five and a half hours, left a stain behind, and was lightly hydrating.",A
MAC,CANDY YUM YUM,Lipstick,"a neon, cotton candy pink with strong, blue undertones and a satin finish. It had good pigmentation‚Äìjust a little shy of opaque in places‚Äìwith a creamy consistency that wasn‚Äôt too heavy or too thin. There was a slight bit of color that sat in my lip lines, though. This shade is part of the permanent range, so it can be purchased in standard packaging at any time. On me, it wore well for over six hours and was slightly drying toward the end of wear.",A-
MAC,A KILLING SMILE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark fuchsia-red with subtle, cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had, rich, opaque pigmentation that applied evenly to the lips and did not tug on them during application. The consistency was smooth, almost velvety as it glided on, and lightweight. The color was still mostly intact after six hours of wear and was slightly drying after five hours of wear.",A
ANASTASIA,VERMEER,Eyeshadow,"a light, peachy beige with warm undertones and a smooth, frosted sheen. It was richly pigmented with a very smooth, finely-milled consistency that applied beautifully to the lid as it adhered evenly. This eyeshadow appears in the Modern Renaissance palette and is quite similar, but the single had a better texture‚Äìless powdery‚Äìand wasn‚Äôt messy to use. On me, it wore well for eight hours before fading noticeably.",A-
ANASTASIA,LOVE LETTER,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, reddish berry with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation‚Äìmostly opaque but buildable to full coverage, if desired‚Äìthat applied evenly to bare skin and was fairly blendable. The consistency was drier and not as finely-milled compared to most of the brand‚Äôs matte eyeshadows, but I have personally experienced a lot of red-hued eyeshadows that all suffer from a grittier or rougher texture. Luckily, in practice, I did not notice the texture‚Äôs shortcomings when applying the eyeshadow to my lid with a brush. The color stayed on well for eight and a half hours. This shade appears in the Modern Renaissance palette and was consistent in quality/color compared to the one I have in the palette.",B+
ANASTASIA,REALGAR,Eyeshadow,"a slightly muted, medium-dark brown with warm, reddish-orange undertones and a matte finish. It was very comparable to the version in my Modern Renaissance palette, both in terms of color as well as quality. The eyeshadow had great color payoff paired with a silky, smooth, and blendable texture that was easy to work with. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading.",A
ANASTASIA,BRICK,Eyeshadow,"a rich, medium-dark brown with warm, orange undertones and a matte finish. It had intense pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin. The eyeshadow felt smooth, silky, and finely-milled and blended out with little effort on the lid. The color stayed true for about eight hours before I noticed slight fading and wear.",A
ANASTASIA,BALLET,Eyeshadow,"a medium pink with strong, warm undertones and a frosted finish. It seemed slightly sparkly, too, and the texture reflected that‚Äìlooser, chunkier, and drier to the touch‚Äìand was not one of the brand‚Äôs best. Even over primer, it had a tendency to sheer out and had some fallout, but it was more workable applied damp or over an adhesive base. The eyeshadow had semi-sheer to medium coverage, which was only buildable with a dampened brush. It wore well for seven hours before fading noticeably on me.",D+
ANASTASIA,GEMSTONE,Eyeshadow,"a medium, pinky plum with warmer undertones and a frosted finish. The pigmentation was opaque, while the texture was soft, smooth, and blendable. It had a looser press than some of the other shimmery eyeshadows from the summer collection, though (did not have the heavier, more silicone-like feel of other shades). It wore well for eight hours on me before fading.",A-
ANASTASIA,MOON JELLY,Lipgloss,"a translucent base‚Äìpossibly gold-tinted‚Äìwith iridescent blue and lavender sparkle. It looked like a sheer gloss with ‚Äúsemi-sheer‚Äù sparkle. It had somewhat even dispersion of the sparkle, but it could have been more evenly spread across the lips. The texture was smooth, slightly thinner than their more opaque glosses, but still on the tacky side. It wore well for four and a half hours and was hydrating. The pigmentation was the reason for the rating on this shade, as the formula is described as opaque and there was nothing that indicated this was different (at least not on the brand‚Äôs website).",C+
ANASTASIA,GIRLY,Lipgloss,"a medium, orange-copper with warm, reddish undertones and pink pearl and sparkle. It had medium coverage, which wasn‚Äôt really buildable due to the gloss have a slightly thicker texture (compared to most glosses‚Äìbut it did not seem heavy to me) and applying more than a layer to a layer and a half‚Äôs worth of product started to feel too thick and too heavy on. The texture was fairly smooth, but I could feel the texture of some of the larger sparkles in the formula. The gloss was lightly tacky and lasted for four and a half hours. It felt hydrating to me while worn.",B-
ANASTASIA,PARFAIT,Lipgloss,"a brighter, medium reddish copper with warm pink and gold pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly across the lips and did not have any streaking. The texture was smooth, lightly tacky, and a little thicker than the average gloss but did not feel heavy or goopy to me. It wore well for five hours and was hydrating while worn.",A-
CIATE,BABY DOLL,Blush,"a muted, medium-dark pink with subtle, cooler undertones paired with warmer, golden shimmer. It had a luminous sheen that was pronounced on the skin but stopped just short of emphasizing my skin‚Äôs natural texture. It had buildable color payoff from medium to opaque that applied easily to bare skin and blended out almost effortlessly. The texture was smooth, finely-milled, and not at all powdery or dusty in the pan but very easy to pickup with a brush. It wore well for nine hours on me before fading slightly.",A
CIATE,SUMMER LOVE,Blush,"a light-medium peach with a hint of pink paired with a luminous sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage, but it was less ‚Äúbarely-there‚Äù as it was a fairly pigmented product. The texture was smooth, soft, and blendable, so it was more forgiving if one wanted to use a lighter touch or diffuse a lot for sheerer coverage. It had a strong highlighting effect on the skin, and this particular shade seemed to emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture slightly. The highlighting blush lasted for eight and a half hours on me.",B+
NATASHA DENONA,SUNSET,Palette,"15 eyeshadows in various warm-toned hues‚Äìa lot of red/orange-toned coppers, oranges, and browns‚Äìwith a mix of matte, shimmer, and sparkle finishes. I think it is actually one of the best Natasha Denona palettes that has been released with respect to cohesiveness and quality. I also feel like 15 is a solid number of shades to create a curated, cohesive, and useful palette from, and for the brand, while still pricey, still a more palatable price compared to the larger 28-pan palettes. The more sparkly shades included in this palette were a serious improvement from the Star palette as well, though I would still recommend using them damp for maximum performance. The majority of the eyeshadows also wore better without primer on me this time around than they have in the past.",A-
ANASTASIA,PINK PASSION,Palette,three coordinated blushes in medium-sized compact. Pink Passion had buildable coverage from medium to semi-opaque that lasted between eight and nine hours on me with two shades being blendable and one that was prone to sheering out on the skin.,B+
URBAN DECAY,SKYWALK,Highlighter,"a sheer, bluish white with fine, iridescent pearl. As described, it was sheer and only buildable to semi-sheer coverage and the key was to let the initial layer dry down before adding any more on top. The consistency was thin, more water-like, and fluid over the skin. I was able to pat it over my cheeks and blend out with my fingertips on bare skin as well as over liquid foundation, but I did have to be careful not to disturb any powder products I layered it over due to the wateriness of the formula. On its own, the highlighter lasted for seven and a half hours on me.",B
MAC,PEONY PETAL,Blush,"a bright, medium cotton candy pink with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation with a firmer, stiffer consistency. This shade has been released in the past, but the version I received to review for this launch was noticeably harder to use due to the firmly pressed powder. I was able to apply and blend it out enough for fairly even coverage, but it was not easy to use. On me, the color started to fade after eight hours of wear.",B-
MAC,SUGAR OR SYRUP,Blush,"a brighter, light-medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and a satin sheen. It had good pigmentation with a soft, smooth consistency that was slightly dusty in the pan but did not appear dry or chalky against my skin. The softer texture made this shade easy to blend out and diffuse along the edges, and it was also usable with a lighter touch for sheerer coverage, if desired. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading.",A-
ANASTASIA,ENCHANTED,Eyeshadow,"a deep, violet purple with cooler undertones and a frosted finish. The consistency was rather dense, almost thick compared to most of the brand‚Äôs formulas (including other frost/metallic shades) but is incredibly pigmented. I would recommend using a flat synthetic brush or medium dome-shaped eyeshadow brush (I used MAC‚Äôs 239 just fine with this). If you‚Äôre familiar with the more recent silicone-heavy eyeshadows that have released lately, you‚Äôll enjoy the formula as it has that same creamy, smooth feel. The eyeshadow adhered beautifully to bare skin, still blended out, and stayed on for nine hours on me.",A
ANASTASIA,VENICE,Eyeshadow,"a medium, bluish aqua with a greenish-gold shift paired with a metallic finish. It had a very creamy, smooth texture in the pan, which applied best with a patting it onto the lid rather than sweeping, but the edges still diffused without issue with a fluffy brush‚Äìit was just not the type of texture that would work for someone who might prefer building up coverage. It had nearly opaque color payoff that lasted for eight and a half hours on me.",A-
ANASTASIA,TIGER'S EYE,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark gold with greenish tones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which was buildable to opaque coverage with two to three layers or used over a primer. The consistency was denser, cream-like but firm enough that I needed to push my brush into the pan to get product onto my brush. Once on the lid, though, it was not stiff or difficult to blend out, so in practice, it was easier to use than one might have expected given the texture. The color started to crease on me after eight and a half hours of wear.",B
ANASTASIA,GOLDEN COPPER,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium coppery brown with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied evenly to bare skin but was best applied by pressing and pulling rather than sweeping. The texture was finely-milled and blendable on the lid, but the press was not quite as firm and there was some fallout during application from the sparkle particles in it. Once applied, the eyeshadow stayed in place well, lasted eight and a half hours, and did not have further fallout.",A-
ANASTASIA,SUNSET,Eyeshadow,"a brighter, medium-dark copper with warm, reddish-brown undertones and a metallic sheen. The consistency was one of the smoothest, silkiest, and creamiest that I have ever tried; it was so soft that it felt almost wet to the touch. The pigmentation was intense‚Äìa little went a very, very long way‚Äìand it applied just as intensely to bare skin with no need for a primer at all. It wore well for nine hours on me before fading.",A+
ANASTASIA,ROSE GOLD,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark copper with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. The pigmentation was fully opaque, while the eyeshadow was smooth, blendable, and easy to work with. It was slightly denser than expected, but there was absolutely no fallout and it adhered exceptionally well to bare skin. This shade wore well for nine hours on me.",A
BOBBI BROWN,ISLAND,Highlighter,"medium, golden bronze with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had a dewy finish on the skin, as the formula never dried down. While the finish was always luminous, it had terrible wear‚Äìon its own, it had slid around noticeably on my skin after four hours of wear. When I tried it over my liquid foundation, it moved my base around a ton and created a lot of patchiness within two hours of wear. It had sheer coverage, and the pearl in this particular shade made it look spectacular but just required so much maintenance, care, and touch-ups.",C-
BOBBI BROWN,NUDE BEACH,Highlighter,"a soft, medium brown with warm, rosy undertones and a barely-there gold pearl. It yielded a subtle tint to the skin, as it was sheer (which was how it was described!) and did not build up (for those who were curious). The texture was very emollient and slippery on the skin, so it did not work well over base products, even more, watery liquid foundations, without moving them around significantly. It did not dry down, which led to it moving around the face within four hours of wear. This shade blended out better than I expected, but I had to take great care to not blend too much over the same area or else it became uneven.",D+
BOBBI BROWN,SUNKISSED,Highlighter,"a medium brown with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had sheer coverage, but it was hard to blend out and get even coverage. There was a definite tint to my skin where I applied this, but it had the effect of looking patchy and emphasizing the unevenness in my actual skin as well. The formula was very slippery and emollient, which gave it a luminous finish on the skin, but it also never dried down and moved around on my skin. The product had migrated around my cheek area within three hours of wear.",D
GUERLAIN,ULTRA SHINE,Bronzer,"a medium, golden brown with warm undertones and a fine, golden pearl. It had sheer coverage, which was buildable to medium coverage. It‚Äôs a new, limited edition powder bronzer that‚Äôs supposed to have ‚Äúfine mother-of-pearl‚Äù in it that ‚Äúimitates the dazzling light of skin that has been left silky by the sun.‚Äù The consistency was soft but powdery, and I suspect that the texture played a role in the pigmentation of the product.",C+
MILANI,SUNGLOW,HIghlighter,"a light-medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a pearly sheen. It had good pigmentation‚Äìjust shy of full coverage‚Äìthat was buildable to full coverage by patting on just a touch more product. The texture was smooth to the touch, soft and blendable without being powdery in the pan, and sat well on the skin except when worn at full coverage, then it emphasized my skin‚Äôs texture ever-so-slightly. On my skin, the highlighter wore well for eight hours before fading.",A
MILANI,SUNSET GLOW,HIghlighter,"a medium-dark copper with warm, reddish undertones and a metallic sheen. It had opaque color payoff that applied beautifully to the skin‚Äìeven, smooth, and reflective without emphasizing my skin‚Äôs natural texture. The powder felt smooth to the touch and did not kick up any excess product in the pan as it had a firmer press. I had no trouble picking up product onto my brush or blending it out. This shade lasted well for eight hours on me.",A
MILANI,SUMMER GLOW,HIghlighter,"a pale, yellow gold with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. The highlighter was quite pigmented and had a soft, smooth texture that was more firmly pressed in the pan, so there was no powderiness but was still pliable enough to be easily used with highlighter brushes (which are often less dense). The powder blended out beautifully on the skin and did not emphasize any texture on my skin. It stayed on well for eight hours before fading.",A
CHANEL,MEDIUM LIGHT,Bronzer,"a light-medium, yellowed peach with a satin sheen. The pigmentation was buildable from semi-sheer to medium coverage (three layers). The texture was very silky and finely-milled, but it was also powdery and kicked up a fair amount of powder in the pan. This also led to it being harder to apply on drier skin (like my arm) as the product did not adhere that well; it was less of a concern over my cheeks (more normal) nor when applied over freshly applied liquid foundation. I could see this shade working as a bronzer on lighter complexions, as only a faint sheen showed on my light-medium skin tone (easier for me to see it in person than in photos), but it could be used as a highlighting powder on light and light-medium, warmer skin tones without adding much color (if any!). The product wore well for eight hours on me.",C+
NARS,LUSTER,Blush,"a medium orange with warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. I expected a lot more shimmer, since the powder version of this shade has it. It had a thin, spreadable consistency that was a little runny but ended up being a lot easier to blend out and apply to the skin than I expected. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that lasted for eight and a half hours on me.",A
NARS,TORRID,Blush,"a medium, orange-coral with warm undertones and barely-there pink pearl. It had semi-sheer to mostly opaque pigmentation when applied in thin layers. To build up the color behind medium coverage, I recommend applying a thin layer, letting it dry, and then intensifying the coverage where you want it. The blush was thin, not quite runny but thin and watery enough that it would drip if you let it! I needed less than half a pump to get medium coverage on both cheeks. It applied evenly, blended out without much effort, and stayed on well for eight hours on me.",A
BITE BEAUTY,#098,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark purple with warm, pink undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had medium, buildable coverage (up to semi-opaque) that applied fairly evenly to lips. The consistency was smooth and just creamy enough to be able to blend the color by pressing my lips together if used all over the lips. The color wore nicely for just over six and a half hours and was non-drying. I think it would work best with Amuse Bouche shades: Eggplant (lighter, warmer), Dragonfruit (lighter, brighter) see comparison swatches.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,#048,Lipstick,"a blackened burgundy with neutral-to-warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good pigmentation, though it wasn‚Äôt quite opaque, that might not work well for just lining the edges of the lips as it appeared lighter (redder) than it did when layered. The pencil was slightly creamy but not truly emollient, and it did not drag on the lips. This shade wore well for almost eight hours with minimal fading, though it felt drying after six hours of wear.
I think it would work best with Amuse Bouche shades: Berry Rouge (purpler), Black Truffle (darker, cooler) see comparison swatches.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,#046,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark brown with warm, red-orange undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had intense, opaque color payoff that was creamy, smooth, and easy to use. The lip pencil filled in my lips with even color with little work and also did a fantastic job of just lining the edges of my lips. The color wore well for six and a half hours and was non-drying. I think it would work best with Amuse Bouche shades: Nori (darker), Maple (brighter) see comparison swatches.",A
BITE BEAUTY,#100,Lipstick,"a deep berry with cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly to lips, even when used for all over color. The consistency seemed creamier when initially applied compared to how it felt over time (and looked, as it did not appear shiny or creamy on). On me, the color stayed on well for eight hours and was slightly drying after six hours of wear. I think it would work best with Amuse Bouche shades: Jam (darker, warmer), Radish (lighter, brighter), Beetroot (warmer) see comparison swatches.",A-
CHANEL,MEDIUM DEEP,Bronzer,"a medium brown with warm, yellow undertones and a golden sheen. It had medium, buildable color payoff (up to mostly opaque coverage) that applied evenly to bare skin. While I had some trouble genuinely building up color and getting the product to ‚Äústick‚Äù to bare skin with a few shades, this shade applied easily. The consistency was smooth, silky, and still a little powdery in the pan like the others, but it blended out nicely and did not lose its intensity unless I wanted it to (and buffed it out). It wore well for eight hours on me before fading.",A-
CIATE,MATCHMAKER,Blush,"a medium-dark pink with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that applied evenly on the skin. The texture was smooth to the touch, firmer and denser but not difficult to use‚Äìthe type of texture that doesn‚Äôt kickup any excess product in the pan but still blends seamlessly on the skin. On me, the blush stayed true for eight and a half hours before fading.",A-
CIATE,DATE NIGHT,Blush,"a muted, medium peachy coral with warm undertones and a frosted sheen. It had buildable color payoff from medium to mostly opaque. The consistency was soft, smooth, and blendable without being powdery or dusty in the pan. It sat well on my skin and did not accentuate the look of my skin‚Äôs texture, though it was certainly a shimmery shade! The color wore well for eight hours before fading on me.",A-
BOBBI BROWN,ANTIGUA,Bronzer,"a muted, medium pink with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had a more ‚Äúneutral‚Äù vibe, as it did not appear strongly yellow and wasn‚Äôt bright like a really cool, more cotton candy-like pink or a richer pinky-coral shade. The color did appear much darker swatched (both on my arm as well as my cheeks) than it appeared in the compact. The consistency was smooth, blendable, and slightly firmer in feel in the pan, but it did not feel dry nor was it stiff to work with. It had mostly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and lasted for eight and a half hours on my skin.",A-
MILANI,GLOWING,Highlighter,"a medium copper with a warm, golden sheen. It had opaque color payoff that applied evenly to bare skin, blended out easily, and had a high-shine finish. I found it accentuated the look of my skin‚Äôs natural texture slightly when worn at nearly full coverage. The powder had a smooth consistency that was soft but not powdery in the pan. The highlighter started to fade on me after eight hours of wear.",A
MILANI,MOON GLOW,Highlighter,"a soft, pinky-peach with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. This shade was more metallic than the others in the line-up, but despite the very reflective finish, it still seemed to provide a smoother overall look to my skin and did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture, even when worn heavily. It was richly pigmented, which was controllable (lighter touch to pickup less product), blendable, and long-wearing with eight hours of wear.",A
BITE BEAUTY,#076,Lipstick,"a slightly muted, medium-dark orange-red with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had rich color payoff that applied smoothly on the lips with a little unevenness (which was easy to blend out by pressing my lips together). The consistency was thin, lightweight, and creamy enough to work as an all over color comfortably. It wore well for seven hours and was slightly drying after six hours of wear. I think it would work best with Amuse Bouche shades: GTA (lighter, brighter), Maple (darker), Cayenne (brighter), Persimmon (lighter, brighter) see comparison swatches.",A
BITE BEAUTY,#080,Lipstick," a deep red with neutral-to-cool undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff in a single pass, which was buildable as a liner but less buildable as an all over color. The pencil had a smooth, almost velvety texture that didn‚Äôt feel waxy but did not skip across the lips either. On me, the color stayed on well for seven hours before starting to fade noticeably, while the formula felt a touch drying after the six-hour mark. I think it would work best with Amuse Bouche shades: Jam (darker, cooler), Beetroot (cooler), Tannin (brighter), Sour Cherry (lighter, cooler)see comparison swatches.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,#084,Lipstick,"a dark burgundy red with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly easily to lips, even when I was filling in my lips with the pencil. The consistency seemed slightly more emollient than other shades in the line-up, but it ‚Äúdried‚Äù shortly after application that it lost a lot of the initial shine. The color stayed on well for seven hours, left a slight stain behind, and was non-drying. I think it would work best with Amuse Bouche shades: Mistletoe (darker), Liquorice (darker), Beetroot (cooler), Tannin (lighter, cooler) see comparison swatches.",A-
BOBBI BROWN,MAUI,Bronzer,"a bright pop of medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and fine, golden shimmer. It had opaque pigmentation that was easily diffused (or used with a lighter hand) for sheerer coverage. The consistency was smooth, firm but not stiff, and easy to pick up with a brush and blend out on the skin. There was a noticeable sheen that did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before fading.",A
DIOR,UNDRESS,Palette,"a new, permanent eyeshadow palette with muted, mid-tone neutrals. One shade was darker, but the other four shades were quite light overall. It has a new formula that‚Äôs supposed to have ‚Äúhighly pigmented‚Äù color with ‚Äúspectacular staying power.‚Äù While several of the other palettes were decent to good in quality, this one missed the mark as more shades were slightly dusty to powdery with sheerer coverage that did not wear as long.",B-
BUXOM,WHITE RUSSIAN ON THE ROCKS,Palette,"six eyeshadows ranging from pale gold to deep plum. I wasn‚Äôt a fan of this palette; it took twice as long to apply due to how long I spent packing and patting colors on to get enough product to stay in place. Many of the eyesahdows were sheerer, dusty/powdery, and prone to fading compared to what I‚Äôve experienced with this formula in the past.",C
NARS,ORGASM,Blush,"a medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and gold shimmer and sparkle. The pigmentation was buildable from semi-sheer to semi-opaque (two to three layers). The consistency was lightweight, thin but not so watery that it sheered out to nothingness, and spread easily across the skin without disturbing base products. For a liquid blush, I found it easy to work with, especially around the edges. The finish was more shimmery swatched than when I applied it to the skin, though there was still subtle shimmer when I tried it on bare skin as a blush. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading.",A
NARS,DOLCE VITA,Blush,"a medium-dark, pinky plum with subtle, warm undertones and a satin shimmer. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly to bare skin as well as over liquid/cream foundation. I liked using a brush more for applying over base products, but for applying on bare skin, fingertips or brushes worked just as well. The consistency was thin without being too runny, and it blended out around the edges with little work. This shade wore well for nine hours on me.",A
CHANEL,MEDIUM,Bronzer,"a light-medium, golden brown with warm, yellow undertones and a satin sheen. It had sehmi-sheer pigmentation in one layer, which was buildable to medium coverage with two to three layers. On my skin tone (about light-medium), the color just barely showed up (more noticeable in person than in photos) with a subtle glow‚Äìnatural and easy-to-wear, so for a true bronzing effect, it seemed like it would suit fair and light skin tones best and be more of a highlighting powder on light-medium and medium skin tones. The texture was soft, silky, and somewhat in the powdery side, so it had a tendency to sheer out a bit on the skin initially. The powder wore well for eight hours on me before fading.",B-
CHANEL,MEMOIRE (224),Eyeliner,"a rich, medium-dark red with cool undertones and fine, ruby red pearl. It had good pigmentation, though it wasn‚Äôt quite opaque, with a smooth, even application that did not settle into my lip lines and actually made my lips appear smoother and plumper. It had a very creamy, balm-like consistency that was quite emollient and glided across the lips effortlessly. The formula was comfortable and hydrating to wear over the five hours the color lasted. There was a faint stain left behind as well.",A
CHANEL,SEPIA (207),Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark plummy brown with warm undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation‚Äìit was one of the least pigmented shades I‚Äôve tried from this range‚Äìthat applied evenly. The lipstick had the same creamy, balm-like feel signature to the formula, but there seemed to be a bit of color that pulled into my lip lines. I think it was more even and smoother than I expected, given the sheerer coverage, but it only lasted for three hours. It was moisturizing while worn, at least!",B-
BOBBI BROWN,SANTA BARBARA,Bronzer,"a medium-dark pink-coral with a strong, golden sheen. It was just shy of being metallic in finish on the skin, but luckily, it did not accentuate my skin‚Äôs natural texture or my pores. It was richly pigmented but had a very forgiving, blendable texture that could be used with a lighter hand (or blended out) for less coverage. I would still recommend it more for someone who wanted greater coverage rather than very sheer coverage. On me, the color stayed on nicely for nine hours before fading noticeably.",A
MILANI,BELLA BELLINI,Blush,"a medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and gold shimmer. It had buildable pigmentation from medium to mostly opaque.",B
MILANI,ROSA ROMANTICA,Blush,"a soft, almost ‚Äúdirty‚Äù peach with warmer undertones and a fine pink and gold sheen. It had sheer pigmentation, which was buildable to medium coverage with three layers. I think it would work better as a highlighter on most skin tones but should work as a very subtle blush on very fair complexions. The consistency was dusty and prone to sheering out, so it was rather messy in the pan, though it did not look chalky or dusty on my cheeks. There was a noticeable sheen and a smidgen of color (more visible in person than in photos) that lasted for seven hours on me.",C+
DIOR,FEEL,Palette,"a new, permanent eyeshadow palette with a deeper set of neutral shades. It has a new formula that‚Äôs supposed to have ‚Äúhighly pigmented‚Äù color with ‚Äúspectacular staying power.‚Äù The formula was better than some of the past iterations from Dior, though it was still more semi-opaque to opaque in coverage but had seven to eight-hour wear. The big difference that I noticed was in the texture; it was firmer (but not stiff) in the pan and had less dustiness than some of the past formulations.",A-
CHANEL,DEEP,Bronzer,"a medium-dark, reddish brown with warm undertones and a fine, golden micro-shimmer. It had medium, buildable pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across the skin. The texture was smooth, silky, and slightly powdery in the pan but applied well to my skin‚Äìeven the drier areas‚Äìand had a subtle sheen. It wore well for just over eight hours on me.",A-
SMASHBOX,ICED OUT,Lipstick,"a rich, deep blue with a hint of purple and fine blue pearl. The consistency was light-medium in thickness, tacky but not goopy, and smooth. It was intensely pigmented and applied with opaque coverage in a single layer with little fuss. There was a bit of color that sat in my lip lines (they seemed darker), the high-shine finish made that less apparent in person. On me, this shade wore well for six hours and was lightly hydrating.",A
BOBBI BROWN,BIKINI,Highlighter,"a light-medium pink with warm undertones and gold and pink pearl. It had sheer coverage with a dewy sheen that did not dry down. The effect is pretty on the skin if you like a really dewy glow, but the lack of dry down made it a fussy product to use as it disturbed any base products, broke foundation/powder down within hours, and on its own, it had moved around noticeably on the skin after four hours. The formula was just too emollient for practical, all-day long wear.",C-
BOBBI BROWN,DESERT SUN,Highlighter,"a soft, medium-dark plum with neutral-to-warm undertones and a natural sheen. It did not seem truly shimmery but possibly had the very slightest bit to give it a stronger shine on the skin. It had sheer coverage and yielded subtle color on my skin tone along with a dewy finish. The stick had an incredibly emollient texture that felt heavy on the skin if built up, so a thin layer was most comfortable and easiest to deal with on the skin. I expected foolproof blending but found that the sheerness made any unevenness more noticeable and the slippery quality made it hard to get an even layer of coverage. The product started to move around and migrate on my face after four hours of wear.",D+
CHANEL,ESQUISSE (227),Lipstick,"a brighter, medium pink-coral with subtle, warm undertones and a smattering of very fine pearl. It had mostly opaque pigmentation with a very smooth, creamy, and slippery consistency that glided on easily and was extremly comfortable to wear. The more slippery consistency showed very slight ‚Äúlines‚Äù when I pressed my lips together, and I noticed a bit of color in my deeper lip lines. The shinier finish distracted from the settling, though. This shade wore well for three and a half hours and was moisturizing.",B+
CHANEL,FICTION (222),Lipstick,"a brighter, medium red with warm, orange undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. It had good pigmentation, though it was not opaque. The color went on evenly and smoothly without pulling into my lip lines or showing ‚Äúlines‚Äù when I pressed my lips together. The texture was smooth, creamy, and quite emollient with a balm-like feel that was comfortable and hydrating. It wore well for four hours and left a very faint stain behind.",B+
ANASTASIA,FRESH PEACH,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark peachy-orange with warm undertones and a soft, pearly shimmer. It had medium, pigmentation, which was buildable to semi-opaque (at best), even with a primer. The texture was dustier and thinner, so it was prone to sheering out. I found this shade most useful for blending out other shades in the crease as a transition shade than for all-over application on the lid. It wore well for seven hours before fading on me.",C-
ANASTASIA,CHINA ROSE,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark copper with warm, reddish undertones and a gold, frosted shimmer. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, soft texture that was also looser in the pan, so there was some excess product kicked up in the pan and a bit of fallout during application. It blended out nicely, though, and lasted for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
ANASTASIA,ORANGE SODA,Eyeshadow,"a medium orange with warm undertones and a matte finish. The color payoff was quite good‚Äìa smidgen shy of full coverage as the texture was so soft that it was a bit powdery and sheered out in practice. On me, the eyeshadow wore well for seven and a half hours before fading noticeably.",B+
ANASTASIA,MOSS,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark olive green with subdued, warm undertones and a soft, golden sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly on bare skin. The texture was soft, smooth, and blendable without being powdery or too stiff in the pan. The color lasted well for eight hours on me.",A-
ANASTASIA,AQUA,Eyeshadow,"a medium, green-leaning aqua with subtle, warm undertones and a satin shimmer. It had semi-opaque pigmentation paired with a soft, slightly powdery consistency that kicked up some excess product in the pan and sheered out noticeably on bare skin. This is a shade that I would recommend using a primer with to maximize its performance. On its own, it started to fade after six and a half hours of wear.",B-
ANASTASIA,IRIDESCENT PURPLE,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark purple with cooler undertones and a pearly sheen. It had good color payoff, though it wasn‚Äôt opaque and took two to three layers to build it up to opaque coverage. The texture was slightly drier and firmer in the pan, but it was still blendable and didn‚Äôt require extra effort to use. I noticed the color appeared faded after seven and a half hours of wear.",B+
ANASTASIA,NOIR,Eyeshadow,"a deep black with neutral undertones and a matte finish. It was intensely pigmented with a smooth, velvety consistency that wasn‚Äôt too thin or too dense in the pan. One of the characteristics I really look for in a color like this is blendability, and this one had it‚Äìwhether I used it in more gradual layers to smoke out another eyeshadow or applied all over the lid for an intense look. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.",A-
MAC,MYTH,Lipgloss,"light-medium, peachy orange with warm, yellow undertones and very fine, gold pearl. It had medium to semi-opaque pigmentation that applied unevenly and was incredibly prone to pulling into my lip lines. The gloss was lighter weight than others in the range, but it still had the tackier feel of Lipglass. This shade wore nicely for four hours on me and was slightly hydrating.",C
MAC,LOVE NECTAR,Lipgloss,"soft, medium orange with warm undertones and pink and gold pearl. It had medium coverage that applied decently, but it could have went on more evenly and stayed out my lip lines. The texture was smooth, light-to-medium in weight, and somewhat tacky. The gloss stayed on well for four and a half hours on me.",B-
MAC,BLISSFUL,Lipgloss,"light-medium orange with warm undertones and fine, gold and white pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that did not apply well, as it was slightly streaky and uneven in coverage while noticeable color slipped into my lip lines. The gloss was thicker but shy of feeling goopy on the lips, though it was still tacky. It lasted for four and a half hours and was slightly hydrating.",C+
MAC,PRRR,Lipgloss,"a soft, peachy coral with warm undertones and fine, gold and pink pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly across the lips. The texture was smooth, light-medium in weight, and comfortable to wear and to spread across the lips. I had just a touch of color that settled into my deepest lip line, but the gloss had a fairly smooth appearance otherwise. The color wore well for five hours and was lightly moisturizing over time.",A-
PRETTY VULGAR,HUSH BLUSH,Blush,"a muted, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had medium coverage, which was buildable to semi-opaque coverage with two to three layers.",C+
BITE BEAUTY,#070,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark coral with warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. It was intensely pigmented with a smooth, velvety consistency that spread well across the lips for all-over color as well as for lining just the edges of the lips. The lip liner was comfortable to use, while the resulting color stayed on well for over six hours. The formula did not seem to be drying until after eight hours of wear. I think it would work best with Amuse Bouche shade(s): Pickled Ginger (slightly lighter) see comparison swatches.",A
BITE BEAUTY,#072,Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange with warm, reddish undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in one layer, which went on evenly and smoothly with little blending required. The texture of the liner was smooth, velvety enough to glide across the lips without tugging uncomfortably. It adhered well for over six hour wear, as it was still mostly intact after that point, and was non-drying. I think it would work best with Amuse Bouche shades: GTA (darker), Cayenne (darker), Persimmon (slightly darker, warmer) see comparison swatches.",A
BITE BEAUTY,#056,Lipstick,"a medium black with subtle,w arm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly to the lips for all-over color. It was easiest to maneuver it along the edges of the lips as a lip liner, but the lack of opaque coverage meant that the edges always looked a little lighter than one might want for a black lip liner. The consistency was smooth, lightly creamy, but it dried down and adhered well without being clingy or uncomfortable. The color lasted for six and a half hours on me and was non-drying. I think it would work best with Amuse Bouche shades: Whiskey (lighter, brown), Black Truffle (purple, cooler) see comparison swatches.",A-
ANASTASIA,WARM TAUPE,Eyeshadow,"a medium taupe brown with neutral-to-warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that appeared slightly lighter swatched than it did in the pan. The consistency was slightly dusty but did not sheer out instantly, so it was workable and would perform best over primer. This shade lasted for seven hours on me before fading.",B-
ANASTASIA,BENGAL,Eyeshadow,"a medium brown with warm, orange undertones and a satin finish. I loved how there was a hint of shimmer strewn through the eyeshadow but it was not overtly shimmery. It had good color payoff, but the dustier consistency made it hard to maintain that level of opacity without a good primer underneath it as the color would sheer out very easily. This shade wore well for seven hours on me before fading.",B-
ANASTASIA,MOROCCO,Eyeshadow,"a slightly muted, medium-dark brown with warm, orange undertones and a matte finish. It had excellent color payoff that applied evenly to bare skin and didn‚Äôt sheer out too readily. The consistency was soft, smooth, and not dusty or powdery but was still blendable on the skin. This shade wore nicely for eight hours.",A
ANASTASIA,SIENNA,Eyeshadow,"a slightly muted, medium-dark brown with warm, orange undertones and a matte finish. It had excellent color payoff that applied evenly to bare skin and didn‚Äôt sheer out too readily. The consistency was soft, smooth, and not dusty or powdery but was still blendable on the skin. This shade wore nicely for eight hours.",A
ANASTASIA,HOT CHOCOLATE,Eyeshadow,"a deep, subtly red-toned brown with neutral-to-warm undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin. The eyeshadow wasn‚Äôt too soft or too firm in the pan, which gave it a smooth, blendable consistency that worked well for darkening other shades or packing it all-over the lid. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.",A-
ANASTASIA,DEEP BROWN,Eyeshadow,"a blackened brown with neutral-to-cool undertones and a matte finish. It had good color payoff that was buildable to opaque coverage (less than two layers). The texture was soft, finely-milled, and just a smidgen dusty in the pan, but luckily, it didn‚Äôt appear powdery on the skin and had very little fallout, even if I forgot to tap off the excess product. The color stayed on well for eight hours before fading on me.",B+
MAC,CANDY BOX,Lipgloss,"a medium pink with strong, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had good color coverage, though not quite full, that applied evenly across the lips. There was slight color that had pulled into my lip lines, but it was hardly noticeable in person. The texture was very smooth, slightly thinner than the average Lipglass but still somewhat tacky. It wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating over time.
The Lipglass formula is supposed to be ‚Äúpigmented, very shiny and can impart subtle or dramatic color‚Äù that can be worn ‚Äúon its own, over lip pencil or lipstick‚Äù and will ‚Äúcondition lips.‚Äù MAC could use an update on the description as some shades are more pigmented than others but several are sheerer and likely intended to be that way. The formula has a very glossy, high-shine finish with a light-medium weight and moderate tackiness. I find that newer Lipglasses (over the last couple of years) are smoother and not quite as tacky as the formula was many years ago. They wear from three to six hours on me and are usually lightly hydrating. MAC recently updated the shade range and packaging for the range (though the formula was said to be unchanged), so worth noting is that with that packaging change came a reduction in quantity to 0.10 fl. oz. (was 0.17 fl. oz.), which may matter for some but not everyone.",A-
MAC,DREAMY,Lipgloss,"a light pink with warm undertones and pink and bronze pearl. It had semi-sheer to medium pigmentation that covered the lips evenly and didn‚Äôt gather in my lip lines. This shade worked well on its own for something sheer but also layered over other lip products nicely. The texture was smooth, lighter weight, and comfortable to wear over the four and a half hours it lasted for.",B
MAC,CULTURED,Lipgloss,"a medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and fine gold and pink pearl. It had nearly opaque pigmentation, which covered the lips evenly and smoothly without emphasizing my lip lines. The gloss was light-to-medium in weight with moderate tackiness but did not feel overly thick or goopy to me. It wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating.",A-
MAC,SOAR,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark plum with warm undertones and fine pink and gold pearl. It had semi-opaque color payoff that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. The consistency was light-medium in weight, not too thick or too thin but still tackier, and easy to spread across the lips. It wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating.",A-
PRETTY VULGAR,GLIMMERS OF BS,Highlighter,"a light-medium, peachy beige with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. The powder highlighter is supposed to be ‚Äúvelvety smooth‚Äù and ‚Äúhighly pigmented‚Äù with a ‚Äúlustrous‚Äù finish. The consistency was smooth, blendable, and easy to work with whether I wanted a barely-there highlight or true-to-pan color, though it was quite pigmented so a moderate touch yielded a very strong highlight on the skin. If one wanted something more diffused or subtle, I would recommend using a lighter hand and a feathery brush.",A
JOUER,GUAVA,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark coral-orange with warm undertones and fine gold and pink pearl. It had more of a ‚Äúmatte‚Äù metallic finish. It was harder to dupe compared from the shades I purchased from Jouer recently, mostly due to the finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that went on decently, but it wasn‚Äôt completely even and needed a second layer for full coverage, though the texture was more emphasizing of the texture of my lips with a second coat (and already accentuated by the initial layer). The color lasted for five hours on me but was non-drying.",B-
JOUER,CAYENNE,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark reddish plum with strong, warm undertones and a metallic finish (that was also matte). The consistency was smooth, spreadable, and thin but not watery. It applied evenly across the lips and had mostly opaque color coverage. There was a bit of color that gathered in my deepest lip line but was hard to notice from a normal viewing distance. This shade stayed on well for six and a half hours and was non-drying.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,#064,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good pigmentation in a single layer/stroke, which applied fairly even to bare skin but was blendable for more even results by pressing my lips together and rubbing gently. The consistency was creamy without being too slippery, and it ‚Äúdried‚Äù and felt lightweight on the lips. There was a bit of color that sat in my lip lines, though. It adhered well and stayed put for over six hours, while the formula felt drying just after the six-hour mark on me. I think it would work best with Amuse Bouche shades: Sangria (brighter, darker, cooler), Sorbet (lighter, warmer) see comparison swatches.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,#088,Lipstick,"a medium purple with warmer, pink undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had good color coverage in one layer, which went on fairly evenly on its own. The consistency was blendable, so I was able to even out the color beautifully just by rubbing my lips together (gently!). The liner was comfortable to use along the edges of my lips and tolerable for all-over color. This shade was still going strong after six hours of wear, and it had just started to feel a touch drying after five and a half hours of wear. I think it would work best with Amuse Bouche shades: Spritzer (lighter, cooler), Gin Fizz (lighter, warmer), Dragonfruit (darker, brighter, warmer) see comparison swatches.",A
BITE BEAUTY,#086,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink with cool, blue undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that went on best along the edges of the lips, but it was workable as an all-over color. I did have to blend and even out the coverage by rubbing my lips together, as it became intolerable to keep maneuvering the pencil as the product ended up bunching up on itself (too much product). The consistency was creamy initially but dried down, and it felt thin but lightweight on the lips. It wore well for five hours on me and was non-drying. I think it would work best with Amuse Bouche shades: Cotton Candy (cooler), Kimchi (darker), Gin Fizz (darker, cooler) see comparison swatches.",B+
MAC,SAUCY LITTLE THING,Lipgloss,"a deep berry with subtle, cool undertones and a jelly-like finish. It had medium to semi-opaque pigmentation that applied without streaking, though there was color that sat in my lip lines. The texture was smooth, thinner than the average Lipglass, and comfortable to wear and to apply, as it spread quite easily across the lips. This shade wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating on me.",B
MAC,DIRTY DARK MARTINI,Lipgloss,"a dark black with neutral undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage, which didn‚Äôt apply with visible streaks, but there was a ton of color that pooled into every lip line I had, which made it unflattering on the lips. The texture was consistent with the formula‚Äìsmooth, moderately tacky, and comfortable‚Äìand lasted for five hours on me.",C+
MAC,PINK LEMONADE,Lipgloss,"a brighter, medium coral with warm undertones and fine pink and white pearl. It had nearly full color payoff that applied smoothly across the lips. The gloss was creamier and had some color that settled into lip lines, though the opacity and mirror-like finish helped minimize that defect in person. This shade stayed on well for five hours and was slightly moisturizing over time.",A-
MAC,RAVISHING,Lipgloss,"a brighter, creamsicle orange with warm undertones and a smattering of fine, gold pearl. It had smei-opaque pigmentation that applied decently, but it could have went on more evenly and stayed out my lip lines better. The texture was smooth, light-to-medium in weight, and noticeably tacky but not too thick. This shade wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",B
PRETTY VULGAR,ARTFUL DECEPTION,Lipstick,"a dark, taupe brown with warmer undertones and multi-colored pearl. It had rich pigmentation that covered the lips with even, opaque color. The liquid lipstick was smooth, just a touch tackiness, and spreadable, though there was a bit of color that sat in my deeper lip lines. However, this wasn‚Äôt as noticeable in person as the glossiness distracted from it. The color wore well for almost six and a half hours with most of the glossiness",A
PRETTY VULGAR,BRILLIANTLY SNEAKY,Lipstick,"a brighter, medium coral-red with warm undertones and lots of fine, gold and pink pearl. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly on the lips. This particular shade seemed more prone to pulling into my lip lines and highlighted the texture of my lips more. The consistency was smooth, not too thin or too thick, and easy to spread across the lips without it sliding around. The glossiness lasted for four hours, while the color lingered for another hour and a half after that.",A-
PRETTY VULGAR,MADE WITH MISCHIEF,Lipstick,"a rich, deep purple with warm, reddish undertones and fine violet and plum pearl. It had good pigmentation, though not quite opaque, that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. The consistency wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin, lightly tacky, and comfortable to wear. There was a smidgen of product that creeped into my lip lines, but the shininess made it less noticeable from a normal viewing distance. This shade wore well for six and a half hours on me (though the shine had worn down by the fourth hour) and was hydrating.",A
SMASHBOX,BALLER,Eyeliner,"a deep, blue-teal with cool undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which was buildable to mostly opaque coverage that was somewhat even. I expected this shade to apply better than it did, and to help the color even out, I used a synthetic smudger brush to smudge and blend out the edges a bit. It was comfortable to apply and never tugged, even on the waterline. It wore well for eleven hours well on my lower lash line and nine hours on my lower waterline; after sixteen hours, there was still visible liner on my lower lash line but seemed like 40% had worn away (give or take!).",C+
SMASHBOX,BUBBLY,Eyeliner,"a light, golden beige with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good pigmentation in a single stroke, but I found it very hard to layer as it would lift some of the color I had initially applied, which resulted in uneven coverage overall. The texture was very creamy and comfortable to apply. This was the shortest wearing shade that I tried, as it only lasted for eight hours on my lower lash line well, and it had almost vanished entirely by sixteen hours. It did not apply well to the waterline.",C-
SMASHBOX,MOODY,Eyeliner,"a muted, dark taupe with warmer undertones and a cooler overtone. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in one layer, which was somewhat buildable to mostly opaque coverage with two to three layers. The pencil was creamy, a little slippery initially, but it dried down and stayed in place for the next nine and a half hours well on my lower lash line (and six hours on my waterline). After sixteen hours of wear, it seemed like there was about two-thirds of the original thickness of the liner left.",C
SMASHBOX,NYMPH,Eyeliner,"a rich, dark purple with warmer, pink undertones and cooler violet and blue pearl. It read ‚Äúcooler‚Äù to me overall. The texture was smooth but not nearly as creamy as the other shades, and it had more of a tendency to look drier along the edges. It was somewhat buildable from medium coverage to mostly opaque coverage with two to three layers. This shade wore well for seven and a half hours on my waterline and ten hours on my lower lash line. After sixteen hours of wear, about half of the liner was still remaining on my lower lash line.",C-
BITE BEAUTY,#058,Lipstick,"a bright white with neutral undertones and a matte finish. Compared to a lot of white-based products, it did not apply the worst, but it would be hard to wear it on its own as it had a tendency to appear drier and clump on itself. It would be best for lining the edges of the lips or underneath another lip product (likely to lighten it). The consistency was lightly creamy but quick to dry down‚Äìit looked drier than it felt, though‚Äìand could not be totally evened out by pressing my lips together, like most of Bite‚Äôs lip liners can be. This shade lasted for four and a half hours on its own, though it seemed to separate more and more around my lip lines over time.",B-
BITE BEAUTY,#060,Lipstick,"a light peach with warm, orange undertones and a matte finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation in a single stroke, but it was difficult to get the same level of coverage on my lips. In practice, it had good coverage, just not full coverage. The lip pencil was velvety and applied decently on its own, but there was separation along my lip lines. The color wore well for five hours on its own and was non-drying.I think it would work best with Amuse Bouche shades: Meringue (darker, pinker), Honeycomb (much darker) see comparison swatches.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,#050,Lipstick,"a muted, grayish mauve with neutral undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation when applied to lips, which was easy to apply along the edges of my lips and manageable for all-over color. After getting most of the color applied to my lips, I gently pressed my lips together to even out the coverage, which worked extremely well. The color lasted for six hours and was non-drying. I think it would work best with Amuse Bouche shades: Sake (lighter), Mauvember (darker), Thistle (grayer) see comparison swatches.",A-
DIOR,EXPOSE,Palette,"a new, permanent eyeshadow palette that features earth-toned neutrals. I spotted in on Selfridges last week and purchased mine there, but it‚Äôs now available through Dior‚Äôs website and some of the accompanying new palettes are at Sephora (but not all). It features a new formula that‚Äôs supposed to have ‚Äúhighly pigmented‚Äù color with ‚Äúspectacular staying power.‚Äù The formula was better than some of the past iterations from Dior, though it was still more semi-opaque to opaque in coverage but had seven to eight-hour wear. The big difference that I noticed was in the texture; it was firmer (but not stiff) in the pan and had less dustiness than some of the past formulations.",A-
GIORGIO ARMANI,NOTORIOUS (408),Lipstick,"a bright, medium red with warm, orange undertones and a cream finish. It had opaque pigmentation that applied well to lips with smooth, even coverage. The texture was velvety, creamy, and flattering on the lips as it masked my lip lines and did not sit in them. The color stayed on well for seven hours and left a slight stain behind, while the formula felt hydrating over time.",A
GIORGIO ARMANI,PAPARAZZI PINK (518),Lipstick,"a light-medium pink with cool, blue undertones and fine, multi-colored pearl. It had medium pigmentation, which was buildable to semi-opaque coverage. The texture was smooth, velvety, and lightweight but it seemed more emollient compared to other shades. It did not apply as evenly as most of the other Lip Maestros I‚Äôve tried. This shade wore well for four and a half hours on me, which was quite short for the formula, though it was hydrating.",C+
GIORGIO ARMANI,SPOTLIGHT (516),Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a creamy finish. The pigmentation was intense‚Äìfull coverage in a single swipe‚Äìthat went on evenly. The lipstick had a smooth, velvety feel that wasn‚Äôt too thin or too thick and had enough substance to it to fill in my lip lines without settling into them, so my lips appeared fuller and smoother overall. This shade wore well for seven hours on me and was moisturizing while worn.",A
MAC,LOVE CHILD,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark plum with warm undertones and copper shimmer. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied beautifully to the lips with smooth, even coverage that didn‚Äôt emphasize my lip lines at all. The texture felt smooth, light-to-medium in weight, and had noticeable tackiness that never felt goopy. This shade stayed on well for five hours and was hydrating over time.",A
MAC,REBEL,Lipgloss,"a rich, plum-berry with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips with very little settling. The texture was smooth, almost gel-like but was still somewhat tacky. It lasted for six hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A-
MAC,PURPLE MOCHA,Lipgloss,"a blackened plum with a hint of purple paired with fine, multi-colored pearl. For as dark as the shade was, it applied more evenly than I anticipated, but it did pull substantially into my lip lines. The shimmer helped distract from that a bit but not entirely. The gloss was lightly hydrating, moderately tacky, and comfortable for the five hours it wore well for.",B
MAC,DESIRE,Lipgloss,"a rich burgundy red with subtle, warm undertones and a jelly-like finish. The consistency felt very smooth, almost gel-like but still moderately tacky like your typical Lipglass. It applied evenly without streaking, which was impressive given it was only semi-opaque in coverage. The issue I had with this shade was that there was noticeable color in my lip lines after application. This shade wore well for five hours and was lightly moisturizing.",B+
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,KATE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, rosy mauve with subtle, cool undertones and satin finish. It was richly pigmented with a creamy, smooth consistency that wasn‚Äôt too slippery nor was it too dry in the tube, so it glided on without tugging and delivered even coverage. The texture sat well on my lips and seemed to smooth out some of the texture on my lips. The lipstick was comfortable to wear and felt non-drying throughout the time it lasted (which was seven hours).",A-
ANASTASIA,VANILLA,Eyeshadow,"a very light beige with a hint of warmth paired with a matte finish. It had good color coverage that applied evenly to bare skin, and it was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The texture was soft, a little dusty, but blendable and did not appear dry or powdery on my lids. It did have a tendency to sheer out a bit, so a primer would help improve opacity if one wanted to wear it as a lid shade. It wore well for seven hours on me before starting to fade.",B
ANASTASIA,FRESH,Eyeshadow,a light beige with neutral-to-warm undertones and a matte finish. The eyeshadow was incredibly silky and smooth‚Äìalmost creamy as there was hardly any powderiness‚Äìthat was very easy to blend out on the skin. It had opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and lasted for seven and a half hours.,A
ANASTASIA,CREAM,Eyeshadow,"a soft, light-medium beige with warm, peach undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation with a soft, finely-milled texture that wasn‚Äôt too soft or too firm in the pan. It could be sheered out as well as packed on, so it was a versatile shade. It wore well for seven and a half hours on bare skin.",A-
ANASTASIA,SOFT PEACH,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium, peachy orange with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that adhered evenly to the lid. The eyeshadow blended out a little too much too quickly without a primer, so to retain true-to-pan intensity and full coverage, I would recommend using a primer underneath it. The texture was soft, smooth, and just a touch dusty in the pan but did not have a lot of fallout in practice. The color started to look faded after seven hours of wear.",B
ANASTASIA,LEGEND,Eyeshadow,"a soft, light-medium golden yellow with warm undertones and a frosted sheen. It had rich pigmentation that applied evenly to bare skin. The consistency was soft without being powdery, and the eyeshadow blended with ease but did not lose its intensity. This shade wore well for just shy of eight hours on me.",A-
ANASTASIA,GOLD BAR,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium gold with subtle, warm undertones and a frosted sheen. It‚Äôs almost like a ‚Äúcool-toned‚Äù gold without being green-tinged. The texture was slightly dry in the pan, so there was a bit of dustiness to the eyeshadow, but it applied with good coverage and didn‚Äôt sheer out too readily, while it still blended out nicely along the edges. It didn‚Äôt start to fade until after seven and a half hours of wear.",B+
MAC,GIRL ABOUT TOWN,Lipgloss,"a rich, medium-dark fuchsia pink with fine violet and white pearl. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in one layer, while the texture covered the lips with even, smooth color with almost no visible settling into my lip lines. The high-shine finish gave the illusion of plumper, fuller, and smoother lips, too. The gloss stayed on well for six hours and was lightly hydrating.",A
MAC,MISBEHAVING,Lipgloss,"a brighter, medium lavender with warmer, pink undertones and a milky, cream finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff that covered evenly without streaking, but there was color that pulled into my lip lines. The gloss was light-to-medium in weight, smooth with some tackiness, and spreadable. It wore well for four and a half hours on me and was lightly moisturizing.",B
MAC,HEROINE,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium-dark magenta purple with warm, pink undertones and fine fuchsia and violet pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which applied decently but was surprisingly hard to apply evenly in places‚ÄìI felt like it just wasn‚Äôt adhering as well to my lips in some areas. The texture was smooth, moderately tacky, and not too thick or too thin. The color wore well for five and a half hours and was slightly moisturizing.",B
MAC,DIVE BAR,Lipgloss,"a medium purple with cool, blue undertones and lighter blue and silver pearl. It was a neat shade and one I haven‚Äôt really seen often, but the gloss just applied so poorly to lips‚Äìstreaky, uneven, and incredibly prone to settling into my lip lines‚Äìthat wasn‚Äôt workable on its own. The coverage was semi-sheer to medium but not buildable beyond that. The texture felt smooth, moderately tacky, and not too thick or too thin, and the gloss still wore longer at five hours.",C-
BITE BEAUTY,#052,Lipstick,"a blackened greenish-teal with cool undertones and a satin finish. There was very, very fine pearl that kept it from appearing totally matte, but it did not have true shine once applied to the lips. It looked blacker and had less noticeable green coloring on my lips compared to swatched on my arm. The consistency was lightly creamy and easy to maneuver along the edges of my lips. It applied decently as an all-over color but was evened out by pressing my lips together. It lasted for over six hours and was non-drying. I think it would work best with Amuse Bouche shade(s): Kale (lighter, greener on) see comparison swatches.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,#054,Lipstick,"a deep, navy blue with cool undertones and a purplish tone. It appeared less blue and more purple when applied to my lips, which was likely the result of it not being totally opaque, so some of the natural pinkness of my lips came through. The consistency was smooth, a touch creamy but not too emollient, and evened out best by rubbing my lips together, but after doing so, it was surprisingly even for such a deep shade. I think it would work best with Amuse Bouche shade(s): Squid Ink (bluer, less purple) see comparison swatches.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,#094,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark fuchsia with cool, blue undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation a single layer, and the formula was lightly creamy and easy to work with on the lips. I was able to line the edges of my lips but could also fill in my lips entirely with this color. I pressed my lips together gently to even out the color at the end, which worked well. This shade lasted for eight hours with minor fading, though it started to feel drying after seven hours of wear. I think it would work best with Amuse Bouche shades: Kimchi (brighter, lighter), Dragonfruit (slightly brighter) see comparison swatches.",A
JOUER,MURE,Lipstick,"brighter, medium pink with subtle, cool, blue undertones and a matte finish. The liquid lipstick was thin but not watery, so the product was spreadable but did not appear streaky or uneven on the lips. It dried down to a matte finish that was a bit softer and not as flat-looking as other shades in the range, though there was color that settled and dried down into a couple of my deeper lip lines. The color stayed on well for just over six hours before fading noticeably, though it was mostly non-drying.",A-
JOUER,CABERNET,Lipstick,"a rich, deep red with cool undertones and a matte finish. The color was absolutely stunning‚Äìso rich but very cool-toned‚Äìbut it did not apply as well as I expected it would. Normally, red lip colors are quite pigmented but this was only semi-opaque. The formula was thin and did not apply evenly, which made the lack of opacity more obvious. Thankfully, the formula did allow for a second layer to be applied without causing any issues with application or wear‚ÄìI just wish this had truly knocked it out of the park! The color wore well for over six hours and left a very slight stain behind. The formula was slightly drying toward the very end of the wear.",B
MAC,PLEASE ME,Lipgloss,"a soft, light-medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly, given the type of color and texture, but there was noticeable color that had settled into my lip lines as milky consistencies often do. The gloss wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing.",B
MAC,ANGEL,Lipgloss,"a brighter, light-medium pink with warm undertones and fine, pink pearl. It had nearly opaque color payoff that applied evenly across the lips. I had a touch of color that was visible in my deeper lip lines, but I did not feel like it was noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The gloss was smooth, noticeably tacky but not goopy, and comfortable to wear. This shade lasted for five hours and was slightly hydrating.",A-
MAC,PINKARAT,Lipgloss,"a light-medium pink with warm undertones and lots of gold pearl. It had semi-sheer to medium pigmentation that went on evenly and smoothly on the lips without emphasizing my lip lines. There was ample shimmer, but the color itself might be different based on your own natural lip color due to the sheerness. MAC did not describe this one as sheer, unfortunately, but I think if you like (or don‚Äôt mind) the sheerness, it‚Äôs a fun shade for layering and everyday wear alone. The texture was smooth, slightly thinner and not quite as tacky as others in the range, and comfortable to wear over the four and a half hours it lasted for.",B
MAC,NYMPHETTE,Lipgloss,"a light-medium pink with warm undertones and lots of gold shimmer. It is actually quite similar to Pinkarat, but Nymphette runs warmer and has larger gold shimmer particles. The consistency was smooth, light-to-medium in weight with some tackiness, and easy to spread across the lips. It had semi-sheer to medium coverage‚Äìmostly in the form of shimmer‚Äìand lasted for four and a half hours. The formula was somewhat moisturizing on me.",B+
MAC,BRONZE HERO,Highlighter,"a rich, deep copper with warm, reddish undertones and a fine, pearl sheen. It had sheer coverage that was buildable to semi-sheer coverage, if desired. There was subtle color and dewiness on my complexion when I used it as a cheek highlighter/bronzer. It also worked well mixed in with body cream for a subtle, warming effect on legs and decolletage. The consistency was thin, definitely watery, and blendable without lifting up base products easily. On its own, the highlighter wore well for eight hours on me.",A-
MAC,SUN RUSH,Highlighter,"a medium gold with warm undertones and fine, gold pearl. It had sheer coverage, as described, which wasn‚Äôt buildable, but the effect was still lightly dewy with a hint of shimmer. It was more noticeable in person, though, and it might be more noticeable on much lighter and deeper skin tones than mine (it just blends in quite a bit with my natural coloring). The texture was thin, watery, and easy to spread across bare skin (or over base products with a gentle touch) as well as to mix with things like moisturizer or foundation. On its own, the highlighter wore well for eight hours before starting to look a bit patchy.",A-
MAC,OH MY BANANA,Palette,"a brighter mix of warm-toned shades from pale gold to coral to plum. This palette has a few repromotes, including two permanent, single shades (Retrospeck and Soft Brown), so you may find your stash already have these, if you‚Äôre a long-time MAC fan. Of the three palettes in the collection, I felt like this was the easiest to use cohesively, and I liked the contrast added by the coral and plum shades. Overall, the palette was good‚Äìeasy to work with, pigmented, blendable, and long-wearing‚Äìand one of MAC‚Äôs better pre-made palettes!",B+
TARTE,CRUISIN',Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark plum with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with just a touch more product layered on top. The lipstick was creamy, lightweight but not too thin, and comfortable to wear. This shade wore well for over six hours and was moisturizing over time.",A
TARTE,POPSICLE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark fuchsia-berry with cool undertones and fine violet and fuchsia pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in a single layer, though the color did apply evenly and smoothly, so it was still wearable on its own but a liner would be necessary for full coverage as it did not build up much. The consistency was smooth, creamy without being heavy, and easy to work with on the lips. It lasted for six and a half hours, left a subtle, pinkish stain behind, and was moisturizing.",A-
TARTE,MIAMI VICE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark red with cool, blue undertones and a natural sheen. It had good pigmentation, though it was not quite opaque, and while I expected it to be buildable, it never seemed to quite get there for me. The texture was slightly more emollient than other shades, which gave it an almost stain-like quality in its finish. It applied evenly and smoothly, and the wear time was impressive at nearly seven hours. There was a stain left behind, and the formula was hydrating to me.",A
MAC,CHA-CHA-CHA,Lipgloss,"a light-medium, pink-coral with warm undertones and a milky, almost jelly-like finish. It had semi-sheer pigmentation that applied fairly evenly, but the milky consistency did result in color gathering in my lip lines. The gloss itself did not look streaky, which is no easy feat for this lighter type of shade. The texture of the gloss was creamy, lightweight, and smooth without being tacky. It wore well for two and a half hours and felt moisturizing.",B
MAC,"SHAKE, SHAKE, SHAKE!",Lipgloss,"a medium, coral-red with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-sheer to medium color coverage that went on fairly evenly, but it had a propensity to pull into lip lines, which was noticeable looking closely but less so from a normal viewing distance. The consistency was smooth, creamy, and non-tacky. It wore well for three hours and was hydrating.",B
MAC,LA SALSA,Lipgloss,"a medium, fuchsia-pink with cool, blue undertones and gold and pink pearl. It had semi-sheer color payoff that applied evenly to my lips. There was a very small amount of gloss that settled into my deeper lip lines, but it was hard to tell from a normal viewing distance. The gloss felt creamy, lightweight, and hydrating over the three hours it lasted for.",B+
MAC,SUMMER SUCCULENCE,Lipgloss,"a light peach with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had a milky quality to the color and texture, so there was a bit of color that pulled into my lip lines, though it did not do so as badly as I expected. The consistency was smooth, lightweight, and comfortable to wear, but the gloss only lasted for two hours on me. The formula felt hydrating while worn.",B-
JOUER,BLUSH,Lipstick,"a soft, medium pink with warmer undertones and a matte finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. The consistency was thin but not watery, and after it dried down, it was slightly ‚Äúcracked‚Äù at my deeper lip lines (center of my bottom lip). The color wore well for six hours before starting to fade down more noticeably. The formula felt a little drying toward the very end.",A-
JOUER,RAYANNE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark mauve with neutral undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which could be made opaque with two layers (but I would recommend waiting for the initial layer to dry down fully before applying the second one). The liquid lipstick was thin going on but spread fairly easily and didn‚Äôt seem watery. This shade wore well for five and a half hours and was non-drying.",B
MAC,FRUIT A LA LA,Palette,"a bold, bright mix of orange and pink with three neutral shades thrown into the mix. Overall, I think eyeshadows applied well to bare skin and wore for most of the day, and as I often find true of MAC‚Äôs eyeshadow (especially more matte shades), they go on better in practice than just swatched. Some of the shades in the palette are repromotes from various palettes released over the years.",B+
MAC,NEW GALAXY,Lipgloss,"a very, very light gray base with multi-colored blue, pink, and purple pearl. The base color was rather sheer, and I didn‚Äôt feel like it added color to my lips but a fair amount of shimmer. The gloss would work well for layering, as the cooler tone of it could alter underlying lip colors nicely. I wish MAC had described this one as sheer, though! The texture was smooth, slightly thinner than the average Lipglass, and comfortable to wear over the four and a half hours it lasted for.",B-
MAC,NORWEGIAN SKY,Lipgloss,"a light-medium sky blue with very fine pink, gold, and lavender pearl. It had medium coverage, which is the type of coverage that rarely works with this type of color in a gloss format: streaky application with lots of noticeable color in my lip lines. The texture was easy enough to spread across the lips, but it was impossible for me to smooth out the color. This shade wore well for four hours and was lightly hydrating.",D+
MAC,NIGHT AND DAZE,Lipgloss,"a rich, cobalt blue with cool, purplish undertones and a cream finish. It was one of those shades that looked incredibly cool in the tube but had such a subpar application that it was not very workable on its own due to unevenness and tons of settled color in my lip lines. It might work over a good lip liner or lightly patted over a very opaque, more matte lip color, but I‚Äôd be wary of using this over anything with moderate slip, as it only made matters worse! The color wore well for five hours on its own and was still moisturizing.",C
MAC,CANDY YUM YUM,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, but there was significant color that had settled into my lip lines‚Äìfar more than most shades in the range. I think this one would be better layered over a lip primer or lip pencil. The consistency was smooth, spreadable, and moderately tacky without being goopy. It wore well for five hours on me and felt hydrating over time.",B+
MAC,LOVE IN THE GLADES,Palette,"like a smoky take on tropical greens and blues. The palette had a mix of cooler undertones and neutral undertones, which made it one of the cooler-toned palettes that I‚Äôve come across. The lightest shade (Grey Stroke) was the biggest miss in the palette, but the other six applied fairly well, had good pigmentation, and lasted for seven to nine hours on me (without primer).",B+
MAC,"OH MY, PASSION!",Blush,"a soft yellow, reddish-brown, pink-coral, and pinky lavender that swirl together and create a subdued pinky-peach with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It could look pinker or more muted depending on how much of the pink/lavender compared to brown was picked up.",A-
TARTE,DAIQUIRI,Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium-dark coral-red with warm undertones and a satin finish. The color payoff was fantastic‚Äìcompletely opaque in one layer‚Äìand applied evenly without any streaking or settling. It felt creamy going on the lips but adhered well (but didn‚Äôt feel clingy) and made my lips appear a little smoother than they were naturally. This shade wore well for almost six hours and was hydrating over time.",A
TARTE,ESCAPE,Lipstick,"a brighter, medium pinky-plum with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly on my lips. The texture was lightweight, creamy but not slippery, and comfortable to wear over the six hours it lasted for. The formula also felt moisturizing while I wore it.",A+
TARTE,VACAY,Lipstick,"a medium-dark plum with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had full coverage in a single layer, while the lipstick was smooth, creamy without being heavy or slippery, and easy to work with. The color glided across the lips without tugging on my lips and yielded even coverage. On me, the color stayed on well for five and a half hours and was hydrating over time.",A+
URBAN DECAY,GOLD GRIOT,Palette,"eight eyeshadows (0.04 oz. each) in more of a neutral palette‚Äìthe twist was that most of the shades are warmer in undertone, but then there was a more neutral, medium gray (BK) and a slightly cool-toned black (Pseudonym) thrown into the mix. (For me, the gray was hard to incorporate with the rest!) The majority of the palette was fairly good, though the gray (BK) and light brown (Levitation) shades could have been more pigmented.",B
URBAN DECAY,GALLERY,Palette,"two blushes, a bronzer, and highlighter. One of the blushes (X-Rated) is available in the permanent range, but the other three are new (and exclusive to the palette). All four shades were consistent in texture and overall quality of the brand‚Äôs Afterglow formula, though the X-Rated in this palette seemed richer and brighter compared to my single, so there was a bit of color discrepancy there. The Afterglow formulas are supposed to be sheer, and none of the four shades in this palette were sheer, which was the big ‚Äúdownside‚Äù to the palette‚Äìbut if you like your products more pigmented, then you‚Äôll probably enjoy the performance of the shades.",B+
URBAN DECAY,TENANT,Palette,"eight eyeshadows (0.04 oz. each) in various colorful hues. This is the type of palette that I think works best as a complementary palette to other eyeshadows one already owns, though there are looks that can be created solely with the shades in the palette‚ÄìI just think it‚Äôll be easier to incorporate some of the pops of color from this palette with transition shades and the like from your stash. There was one eyeshadow (Neo) which was a miss for me, but the other shades were fairly good. If you normally use an eyeshadow primer, I think this palette (with the exception of Neo) would work quite well.",B
MAC,LUST,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark coral with warm, brown undertones and a cream finish. I almost wanted to describe it as a peachy brown, but there was a rosiness to it the color that it truer to a coral to my eye. It had nearly opaque pigmentation, and it applied fairly evenly, though there was a bit of color that had pulled into my lip lines. The consistency was smooth, light-to-medium in weight, and noticeably tacky, though it did not feel overly thick or goopy to me. This shade wore well for four and a half hours and was moisturizing over time.",B+
MAC,SPICE,Lipgloss,"a medium brown with warm, slightly orange undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered with just a touch of streaking along the edges and minimal settling into my lip lines. The texture was very smooth, somewhat tacky, and spreadable. It lasted for just over four and a half hours on me and was lightly hydrating while worn.",B+
MAC,BEAUX,Lipgloss,"a medium brown with warm undertones and gold pearl. It had medium pigmentation that covered the lips fairly evenly with just a touch of color that settled into lip lines, which I did not find noticeable from a normal viewing distance (only in the close-up photos). The gloss had a smoother texture that was comfortable to spread across the lips and to wear. It stayed on well for four and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing.",B+
MAC,OH BABY,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark, caramel brown with warm, reddish undertones and lots of gold shimmer and sparkle. It had medium coverage, but the amount of shimmer gave it the illusion of almost semi-opaque coverage. The gloss was smooth with noticeable tackiness, but it spread comfortably across the lips and didn‚Äôt feel heavy or goopy on me. It wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating.",A-
URBAN DECAY,POST PUNK,Eyeliner,"a bright, light-medium chartreuse green with strong, yellow undertones. It leaned yellower rather than greener, but the green tinge was noticeable. I felt like it could look yellower or greener depending on what else was paired with it. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, but the texture was slightly more emollient compared to the other two shades in the launch, which I felt made it apply a little unevenly so I had to go over the line at least twice to get even coverage. It wore well for six hours on my waterline and eight hours on my lower lash line (the brand doesn‚Äôt comment on these for the waterline, so the rating for longevity is only based on the lower lash line wear time).",B+
URBAN DECAY,ANATOMY,Eyeliner,"a rich, medium-dark, reddish copper with warm undertones and a matte finish. It was richly pigmented and fully opaque with a single pass. The consistency was creamy, smooth, and velvety without feeling waxy‚Äìit seemed less wax-based compared to most of the brand‚Äôs 24/7 range‚Äìand glided on without tugging. It wore well for nine hours on my lower lash line and seven hours on my lower waterline. Of the three shades launched, this one was harder to dupe.",A
URBAN DECAY,VIVID,Eyeliner,"a bright, cyan blue with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had good color coverage in one stroke, which was buildable to full opacity in two layers. The pencil was creamy, soft, and smooth‚Äìit felt less waxy compared to a lot of the brand‚Äôs 24/7 liners‚Äìand never tugged or dragged on my lash line. It wore well for eight and a half hours on my lower lash line and seven hours on my waterline.",A
URBAN DECAY,ABSTRACT,Eyeliner,"a light-medium brown with subtle, warm undertones and a lightly glossy, cream finish. It had good color coverage‚Äìnearly opaque‚Äìthat applied evenly across the lips and never tugged. The texture was lightweight, creamy with moderate slip, and comfortable to wear. There was some color that pulled into lip lines, though the coverage and shininess made it less apparent from a normal viewing distance. This shade wore well for four and a half hours and was hydrating.",B+
URBAN DECAY,EXHIBITION,Eyeliner,"a medium-dark, coppery brown with warm, red undertones and a cream finish. It was richly pigmented and covered the lips with smooth, even color in a single layer. The consistency was lightweight, creamy, and lightly tacky‚Äìit adhered exceptionally well to the lips without emphasizing my lip lines while wearing for hours. The formula was lightly hydrating over the six hours it lasted for (and it was still fairly intact after a meal!).",A
TARTE,BEACH WAVES,Lipstick,"a muted, dark plummy brown with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. The consistency was smooth, creamy without being too slippery, and seemed to be thinner than other shades in the range, as it emphasized my lip texture a little bit. It was richly pigmented, and the color applied evenly and never tugged on the lips. This shade wore well for five and a half hours and was slightly hydrating.",A-
TARTE,BOARDWALK,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark brown with warm, caramel undertones and a cream finish. It had very nearly opaque pigmentation that applied well on the lips with smooth, even coverage. The lipstick was soft, moderately emollient, and glided easily across the lips. This particular shade seemed to have more slip than others, which gave it a glossier finish and made it a bit harder to apply along the center of my lips compared to other shades. It lasted for five hours and was hydrating over time.",A-
TARTE,SHADES,Lipstick,"a deep burgundy with neutral-to-warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which applied decently but had some unevenness with some color that pulled into my lip lines. The texture of the lipstick was more slippery than most in the range, and with this deep type of a color, it struggled to go on nicely without a lip primer or lip liner underneath it. The color wore well for five hours, left a very slight stain behind, and was moisturizing.",B+
DIOR,#003,Highlighter,"a muted, medium golden copper with warm undertones and faint pink and gold pearl. It was very sheer on its own, and when blended, I could barely detect any shimmer or sheen on my skin. It blended out decently but still had a tendency to lift and turn patchy if applied over any foundation (bare skin was fine, as there was nothing to disturb or lift)! When I tried to mix it in with my foundation, it seemed to cause it to separate more and break down faster (by about two hours) but had such barely-there effect that I would reach for so many other products in lieu of it or else use a dewier foundation. On its own, it seemed to last around six hours.",C-
DIOR,#004,Highlighter,"a medium-dark, gold-shimmered copper-brown with warm, orange undertones and a barely-there pearl finish. The texture was really thin and watery, and while I often find the liquid highlighters on the market to be fairly easy to pat onto the skin, this one looked patchy very easily. It was better over bare skin, but by the time I blended out the patchiness, it looked like I was wearing nothing at all‚Äìno real sheen, dewiness, or luminosity. It was easiest to work with by mixing in with my foundation or moisturizer but often made my liquid foundation have more slip and break down faster than it normally would and did not have much impact. From what I could tell when I wore it on its own (it was so, so subtle!), it lasted for six hours before turning patchy.",C-
KAT VON D,LOVECRAFT,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, rosy mauve with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. The consistency was thin without being watery, and it spread easily over the lips for even coverage. It dried down to a flat, matte finish that didn‚Äôt appear ‚Äúcracked‚Äù when I smiled. This shade wore well for seven and a half hours and was lightly drying after six hours of wear.",A
KAT VON D,MALICE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark orange with warm, red undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation, but it wasn‚Äôt fully opaque in one layer, which was surprising given the type of shade (like reds, oranges are often quite pigmented). The texture was slightly thicker than average for the brand but spread evenly across the lips. It seemed to take longer to dry down, and it was a little tacky for longer, so I had a bit of color lift unexpectedly. This particular shade highlighted the lines on my lips after drying down, and it appeared ‚Äúcracked‚Äù when I smiled. It wore well for seven hours and was non-drying but faded more strongly from the center first.",B+
KAT VON D,MISS ARGENTINA,Lipstick,"a rich, deep berry with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage, but you could see my lip freckle peeking through with just one layer applied. If you like a lighter look, the translucency might work for you as the color still applied evenly across the lips, but if you wanted full coverage, a second layer would be necessary. The liquid lipstick was thin, a smidgen more fluid than I would prefer as it took more patience to get precise edges. This shade lasted for eight hours and left a stain behind, while the formula felt a bit drying after six hours of wear.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,PARADISO,Blush,"a bright pop of peony pink with subtle, warm undertones and fine, gold pearl. It had medium, buildable coverage (up to semi-opaque) that looked a lot like a cheek stain once blended out on my skin.",A-
LAURA GELLER,DIAMOND DUST,Highlighter,"a grayish-white base with strong shift to pink-violet paired with a luminous sheen. It had rich color payoff, which was easily blended and diffused for sheerer coverage, if desired. The consistency was smooth, blendable but not so soft that it was powdery in the pan. The brand actually described the formula as a ‚Äútranslucent wash of luminous color,‚Äù and while with a very, very light touch and barely-there application, that effect was achievable, the reality was this was a pigmented highlighter‚Äìwhich may not be a deal-breaker for many. On my warmer skin tone, the cooler base made it easier for me to wear layered on top of blush, but the shift was noticeable on its own or layered. This shade wore well for nine hours on me.",B+
LAURA GELLER,DIAMOND DUST,Highlighter,"a light, peachy pink that shifts from warmer pink to more golden peach‚Äìbut at times it almost looks translucent with just a dewy finish. The coverage was medium when applied directly to the skin using the stick, but once I started to blend out the highlighter, it was hard to keep it at anything greater than sheer coverage. It was hard to really build it back up without the product becoming too emollient. When it was blended out (and sheer), it dried down, but if I just applied a swipe from the stick and left it there, unblended, it did not dry down (over an hour when I was just testing to see).",B
MAC,SPITE,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium taupe brown with rosy undertones and fine pearl. It had nearly opaque color coverage that applied evnely with just a smidgen of color that was visible in my deeper lip lines. The consistency was almost so smooth that it was creamy, but it was slightly thicker than your average gloss and moderately tacky. It wore well for five and a half hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",A
MAC,STEEL KISS,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark taupe brown with warmer undertones and multi-colored pearl. It had semi-opaque coverage with a lot of shimmer, which helped give the gloss a smoother, more even application that was easy to wear on its own or layer over another lip color. The texture was light-medium in weight, tacky but not goopy, and smooth going on. The gloss stayed on well for five hours and was lightly moisturizing.",A-
MAC,BITTERSWEET ME,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark brown with warm, red undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which was somewhat buildable to opaque coverage, but it was hard to get the color to apply evenly in places. The texture was smooth, almost gel-like, and looked very plush and glossy on the lips. This shade wore well for four and a half hours on me and was lightly moisturizing over time.",B+
MAC,CHESTNUT,Lipgloss,"a deep, plummy brown with neutral-to-cool undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which covered the lips somewhat evenly with only a bit of color that gathered in my lip lines (fairly impressive given how dark the shade was). The consistency was slightly thinner than the average Lipglass, moderately tacky, and smooth. The gloss wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating.",B+
JOUER,ROSE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark pink-plum with neutral-to-warm undertones and a metallic shimmer. It had semi-opaque color payoff that could be built up to full coverage with two layers (I recommend waiting for the initial layer to dry). The liquid lipstick was thin without being watery, and it was still spreadable, so I had no trouble applying it to the lips. It wore well for six and a half hours and was just a touch drying after five hours of wear.",A-
JOUER,ROSE GOLD,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, reddish copper with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that applied evenly on the lips. The consistency was thin but not watery or difficult to spread across the lips. It dried to a matte, transfer-proof finish with slight ‚Äúcracking‚Äù at my deeper lip lines. The metallic finish helped camouflage the cracking, so it really wasn‚Äôt noticeable except if I looked up close. This shade wore well for six hours and was lightly drying.",B+
KAT VON D,SKULLY,Lipstick,"a deep black with neutral undertones and a smattering of silver micro-sparkle over a matte finish. It had good color coverage in one pass, though it took two layers for full opacity. The texture was drier initially but became creamier as I used more of the product. It did not apply evenly, though it wasn‚Äôt the worst that I have tried in the range. The color stayed on for five and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating while worn.",D-
KAT VON D,LEMMY,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark forest green with neutral-to-warm undertones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque coverage in a single layer, which was was somewhat buildable. The texture was slightly drier, and I had bits of the lip pencil crumble off as I was attempting to apply it all-over my lips. It applied decently, but I wasn‚Äôt able to fully even it out, despite trying to gently rub my lips together to blend out the color after I did the best I could with the liner itself. This shade started to fade heavily from the center after five and a half hours of wear and was non-drying.",F
TARTE,SKINNY DIP,Lipstick,"a light-medium, peachy brown with warm undertones and a cream finish. There was a noticeable shine to the finish, but it didn‚Äôt feel too slippery applied, so I didn‚Äôt have issues with streaking. I did, however, get color that pulled into my lip lines initially, which worsened over time. There was enough creaminess that I was able to smooth some of the color out while I wore it, but it was hard to prevent without a lip primer or lip liner. It had nearly opaque coverage that still ended up applying better than expected, given the lightness of the color in this type of a finish. This shade wore well for four and a half hours on me and was hydrating over time.",B+
TARTE,PINK LEMONADE,Lipstick,"a light-medium peach with warm undertones and a cream finish. This particular shade seemed to have more slip compared to most of the range, and I had trouble keeping the color in place‚Äìthere were some visible streaks along the edges when I initially applied, and anytime my lips touched, there were ‚Äúlines‚Äù left. The color slipped into my lip lines over time as well. It had semi-opaque coverage that lasted for four hours on me.",B-
TARTE,BEACH BABE,Lipstick,"a slightly muted, light-medium peachy-pink with warm undertones and a cream finish. It seemed slightly pinker applied to my lips compared o how it appeared in the tube or swatched on my arm. The consistency was lightweight, creamy without being too slippery, and never dragged on my lips. It had opaque color coverage in a single layer, which went on evenly without streaking. I had a touch of color that sunk into my deeper lip lines initially, and this worsened slightly over time but not too noticeably overall. The lipstick lasted nicely for five hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",A
BECCA COSMETICS,CAPRI COAST,Bronzer,"a medium brown with warm undertones and a golden sheen. It had semi-opaque and buildable to full coverage with two layers of product, if desired. The powder was smooth, soft without being dusty, and easy to work with on the cheeks and face as the powder blended out nicely. There was noticeable shimmer in the powder, but it produced a luminous sheen when blended out on the skin that did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. This shade wore well for eight hours on me.",A-
BECCA COSMETICS,IPANEMA SUN,Bronzer,"a medium-dark brown with warm, reddish undertones and a natural sheen. It was richly pigmented, but the soft, blendable texture made it easy to apply less (using a lighter hand or more feather brush) to the skin and build the color up. The powder diffused well on the skin and never looked uneven or streaky. The finish was natural‚Äìlike skin but not truly shimmery‚Äìand made it stand out in a sea of bronzers to me. The bronzer stayed on well for eight hours before fading.",A
BECCA COSMETICS,MAUI NIGHTS,Bronzer,"a medium-dark, coppery red with warm undertones and a soft sheen. It had very nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which was definitely buildable to full coverage by just tapping on a smidgen more product. The bronzer had a soft, finely-milled consistency that applied evenly to skin and required very little blending. For as deep and as pigmented as the product was, it was impressive just how easy it was to work with it. The finish was very flattering on the skin, as it didn‚Äôt look flat but wasn‚Äôt so shimmery that it emphasized my skin‚Äôs natural texture either. It could also be worn with a highlighter, too, for a more shimmery effect‚Äìand that made it more versatile. It started to fade on me after eight hours of wear.",A
ESTEE LAUDER,SAFFRON SUN,Bronzer,"light-medium, golden brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that was easy to work with.",A
GIVENCHY,CORAL GYPSOPHILA,Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium-dark coral-orange with warm undertones and a shiny, cream finish. It was richly pigmented with nearly opaque pigmentation in one layer, which applied evenly and smoothly across the lips.",A
KAT VON D,SWANLY,Lipstick,"a very light, peachy-beige with warm undertones and a matte finish. It was richly pigmented in a single stroke, though it ended up being more challenging to get the same, full coverage results when applied all over the lips. When I tried lining just the edges, it went better but the edges looked rougher, almost ragged. The consistency was lightly creamy and smooth, and the liner only tugged somewhat on the lips (more due to how skinny the liner was, I‚Äôd say). It did not go on evenly, but I was able to lightly press my lips together to blend the color out, which worked quite well for evening out the majority of the product. The color pulled away at some of my lip lines and appeared ‚Äúcracked.‚Äù It wore well for five and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating by that point.",D+
KAT VON D,OG LOLITA,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, rosy plum with warmer undertones and a matte finish. It had full color coverage in a single stroke, and it actually applied that way when I filled in my lips with the color entirely. The lip liner felt a lot smoother and creamier than other shades that I‚Äôve tried in the formula, and it seemed like it ‚Äúdried down‚Äù a bit more, as it was still matte. Like Swanly, it did not go on perfectly even on its own, but after I pressed my lips together and gently rubbed to blend, the color evened out beautifully. The color lasted well for six hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",C
MAC,OBVIOUSLY BARE,Lipgloss,"a muted, light-medium brown with warm undertones and fine, white pearl. It appeared lighter applied than swatched for me, and it had a milkier quality to the look of it so that some of the color gathered into my lip lines as milky glosses often do. It was very smooth in feel, and it spread easily across the lips, but it just lacked the evenness that would make it standout. This sahde wore well for four and a half hours on me.",B-
MAC,CHAI,Lipgloss,"a light-medium brown with warm, yellow undertones and fine, pale gold pearl. It had semi-opaque color coverage that applied decently to lips, but it could have went on more evenly and settled less into my lip lines. The gloss was smooth, moderately tacky, and lightly hydrating over the four and a half hours it lasted for.",B-
MAC,ROULETTE,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark taupe with a warm, mauvy tone to it paired with a cream finish. It had semi-opaque, milkier coverage, which resulted in less even application and noticeable color that had pooled into my lip lines. Since it wasn‚Äôt full coverage, my natural lip color made it appear pinker and less brown when applied. The consistency was smooth, light-medium in weight, tacky but not goopy, and fairly comfortable to wear. It wore well for four and a half hours on me.",B-
MAC,EXPLICIT,Lipgloss,"a dirty, medium taup brown with warm undertones and fine, multi-colored pearl. It had medium coverage, which mostly translated into lots of pearly shimmer on my lips. I‚Äôve always been a fan of this shade on its own or for layering, as the base color blends well with natural lip colors so the lack of coverage never looks uneven, but it‚Äôs not listed specifically as a sheerer shade by MAC. The texture was smooth, light-to-medium in weight, and easy to spread across the lips as it wasn‚Äôt too thick, though it was noticeably sticky. This shade wore well for five hours on me.",B+
TARTE,SET SAIL,Lipstick,"a muted, medium, rosy plum with warm undertones and a satin finish. The texture seemed slightly thinner and not quite as emollient as other shades, so I felt like it emphasized the texture of my lips a bit, though it was still comfortable to wear and felt lightly hydrating over time. It had full color coverage in a single swipe, and the lipstick applied evenly across the lips. On me, this lipstick wore well for five and a half hours.",A
TARTE,SURF'S UP,Lipstick,"a medium, reddish plum with warm undertones and a cream finish. It was almost like a darker, muted coral at some angles. The lipstick had a creamy consistency that was emollient enough to glide effortlessly across the lips but didn‚Äôt slide around after it applied. I felt like it ‚Äúset‚Äù in a way, where some of the initial slip dissipated within a few minutes of application (to be clear, it did not actually set‚Äìthere was no true dry down and it never became transfer-proof!). It was richly pigmented and lasted for six hours on me.",A
TARTE,ISLAND LIFE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, reddish plum with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips without dragging or tugging. The consistency was creamy, lighter weight but substantial enough that the color adhered well to the lips and lasted for nearly five and a half hours. It was moderately moisturizing while worn.",A+
HOURGLASS,NUDE BRONZE LIGHT,Bronzer,"a soft, medium brown with warm, yellowish undertones and a matte finish. The brand said this shade was mixed with ‚ÄúNude Light,‚Äù which doesn‚Äôt actually exist in the Ambient Lighting Powder range, but I couldn‚Äôt detect any shimmer or sparkle‚Äìeverything swirled together for a natural, matte finish (matte without being flat). The consistency was smooth, finely-milled, and silky to the touch without being powdery or dusty in the pan. It had semi-opaque color payoff, which was buildable to full coverage in two layers, though it was soft enough in the pan that I could use a lighter hand and get sheerer coverage, if desired. This shade wore well for eight hours on me before fading.",B+
HOURGLASS,DIFFUSED BRONZE LIGHT,Bronzer,"a muted, medium, rosy brown with neutral-to-warm undertones and a soft sheen. One of the downsides of the original two shades in the Ambient Lighting Bronzer range was how warm-toned they were, so I think this particular shade is a fantastic addition to the range (they could still use more shades, particularly some deeper and more red-toned options). The powder was incredibly silky and smooth with very little dustiness in the pan. It had mostly opaque pigmentation, which could be built up to opaque coverage, but the softer texture made it pretty easy to just use a lighter hand to pick up less product for sheerer coverage. This shade started to fade on me after eight hours of wear.",A
KAT VON D,DREAMER,Lipstick,"a bright, light-medium cyan blue with cooler undertones and a matte finish. It seemed to have a whiter base, which gave it a chalkier finish after it had dried down. It had good pigmentation, but it was not opaque in a single layer, so this was another shade that would benefit from a second layer of product (not normally something I find necessary with this formula!). For the type of color, it applied better than most, but there was visible streaking and ‚Äúcracked‚Äù color when I smiled. This shade wore well for six and a half hours and was non-drying.",B
KAT VON D,ROXY,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark purple with cooler undertones and a matte finish. I had higher hopes that the formula would be improved compared to the release of it in last holiday‚Äôs set, but it was still underwhelming. It had medium, buildable pigmentation‚Äìtwo to three layers would work best‚Äìwith a thinner texture that was slightly streaky. It did not build up as well when it was still drying, so I would recommend applying a second layer after the first layer had time to dry down. It did seem to last for nearly eight hours.",B-
TARTE,RUM PUNCH,Lipstick,"a medium, rosy beige with warmer undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque color payoff that applied evenly across the lips. The formula felt creamy enough to glide on without tugging but wasn‚Äôt too thick nor did it slide around on the lips while worn. There was a smidgen of color that pulled into my deeper lip lines, but it wasn‚Äôt something I could notice at a normal viewing distance (only in the close-up photos). The lipstick stayed on well for four and a half hours and was moderately moisturizing.",A-
TARTE,SALT LYFE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium pinky mauve with neutral undertones and a satin finish. It wasn‚Äôt quite as shiny compared to other shades in the range, though it was definitely not matte! The texture was lightweight, creamy without being heavy or too slippery, and was comfortable to apply and to wear. It had great pigmentation that went on evenly and smoothly, which lasted for five hours and felt hydrating over time.",A
TARTE,SUNKISSED,Lipstick,"a light-medium, peachy coral with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly across the lips. The consistency was lightweight, creamy without being too wet (so it didn‚Äôt slide around), and wore down to a more satin-like finish after two hours of wear. There was a touch of color that gathered in my deeper lip lines, though it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance. This shade wore well for four and a half hours on me and was moderately hydrating.",A-
MAC,RUSSIAN RED,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium red with cool undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly and had minimal settling (I couldn‚Äôt tell at all that there was any in person, partially as the color was so bright and the finish so glossy). The gloss had a smooth feel going on, plush but not heavy, and somewhat tacky. It wore well for almost six hours and was lightly hydrating.",A-
MAC,RUBY WOO,Lipgloss,"a rich, medium-dark red with cool undertones and a cream finish. The major differences between this and Russian Red are that it appears darker and more muted. It had good pigmentation, though it wasn‚Äôt opaque, that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. It felt somewhat tacky on, but it sat well and felt smooth going on. This shade lasted for five and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",A-
MAC,BABY'S A VAMP,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark, burgundy red with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. There seemed to be barely-there pearl, but I wouldn‚Äôt describe it as shimmery at all. It had semi-opaque color coverage that went on evenly and didn‚Äôt appear streaky. There was a touch of color that had pulled into lip lines, but I couldn‚Äôt tell at a regular viewing distance. The gloss wore nicely for six hours on me and felt moisturizing.",B+
MAC,YELLOW JACKET,Lipgloss,"a bright, chartreuse green with warm, yellow undertones and fine, lime green-hued pearl. It tinted my lips a greenish-yellow and lightened them up a bit from the base color while adding a medium amount of pearl. For as light as the gloss was, it applied better than anticipated, though it could have been smoother on the lips. I was able to wear this one for almost five hours, and it was hydrating over time.",B-
NARS,NAVAGIO BEACH,Highlighter,"a medium gold with warm undertones and a subtle, pearl sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation with a smooth, lightly emollient texture that glided across bare skin exceptionally well.",B
KAT VON D,DAGGER,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark grayish blue with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation and would benefit from a second layer of product to ensure smooth, even, and opaque coverage. The texture was thin, very fluid, and spreadable but some color slipped into my lip lines‚Äìit just did not seem to apply as evenly or as flatteringly as a lot of the Everlasting Liquid Lipsticks have for me. The color wore well for six and a half hours and was lightly drying after five hours of wear.",B
KAT VON D,WOOLF,Lipstick,"a muted, dark grayish blue with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had good color coverage‚Äìnearly opaque‚Äìwith a fairly fluid, spreadable consistency that ran thinner. It applied evenly for the most part, but there were a few areas where a second layer would be necessary for truly opaque, even coverage. This shade wore well for seven hours and was slightly drying after six hours of wear.",A-
MAC,FAUX SURE,Blush," a medium-dark, rusty copper with warm, red undertones and fine, gold and pink pearl. It appeared redder in the pan as well as applied on my cheeks, especially as I blended and diffused the powder, whereas when swatched, it appeared browner. The consistency was smooth, just a smidgen dry, but it remained blendable and easy to work with as a blush. It had opaque coverage that wore well for nine hours before fading.",A
MAC,TELLING GLOW,Blush,"a bright, medium orange-coral with warm, red undertones and gold shimmer. It had good pigmentation that was buildable to opaque coverage in two layers. It appeared incredibly orange in the pan, but it was much pinker/redder in practice‚Äìboth swatched on my arm as well as blended out on my cheeks. The powder felt incredibly smooth on its surface, but it wasn‚Äôt so soft that it became dusty or powdery in the pan. There was just a fantastic balance between soft and blendable, pigmented and versatile. This shade wore well for nine and a half hours on me.",A
NARS,COTE BASQUE,Highlighter,"a medium, pink-coral with fine, golden pearl. The consistency was smooth, more emollient than the traditional Multiple formula (which has a more velvety, silicone-like feel to me), so I felt like it yielded a more stained-like look applied to the cheeks.",B
KAT VON D,SATELLITE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium blue with subtle, cool undertones and a pearly sheen. It had good color coverage in a single pass, though it was harder to get really even, opaque coverage when I tried to fill in both my upper and lower lips with the pencil. I noticed that while it had felt creamy on the very first use, the outer edge dried out a bit for the next use (even though I put the cap back on!) so I had to get through that layer before it felt creamy again. There isn‚Äôt a lot of product in the tube (most twist-up liners have similar amounts of product), so wasting any is less than ideal! The color applied with moderate unevenness, but I was able to press my lips together and minimize some of it. It started to break down after seven and a half hours of wear, and as soon as I ate, over half of it came off (not a particularly greasy meal). The upside was that the formula was lightweight and non-drying.",D+
KAT VON D,POE,Lipstick,"a deep, navy blue with strong, cool undertones and barely-there blue pearl. It had good pigmentation in a single stroke, and it was lightly creamy, though it tugged slightly on the lips. The color applied fairly even across the lips, including when I tried to wear it as a standalone shade, but I had to press and gently rub my lips together to even out the overall color. It lasted for about seven hours‚Äìas soon as I ate, it had completely worn away from the center of my lips and faded noticeably everywhere else. It was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",C
MAC,HARD TO GET,Blush,"a deep brown with warm, reddish undertones and a pink sheen. I was nervous about this shade, as darker brown blushes are often difficult to apply and blend out, but this blended out quite nicely. It wasn‚Äôt quite as effortless as other shades in the range (but those have been particularly blendable!), but it was still a very easy blush to work with. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that had a luminous finish that did not accentuate my skin‚Äôs texture. The color wore well for ten hours on me.",A
MAC,HUSHED TONE,Blush,"a slightly muted, medium-dark reddish copper with warm undertones and soft pink and gold pearl. This was one of the less shimmery shades within the new permanent range of colors, but it still had a lovely, luminous glow. It had fantastic pigmentation, while the powder was soft, smooth, and blendable without being dusty or powdery. Despite being very pigmented, I had no trouble using a lighter hand for less coverage or diffusing and sheering out the color more once on the cheeks. The blush started to fade after eight and a half hours of wear.",A
CLE DE PEAU,106 BALANCE,Palette,"medium-dark, sparkling gray and a lighter, bluish gray. The two shades created a soft, faded smoky eye, which may be a good option for someone who finds other smoky eye palettes too contrasting or deep.",C+
NARS,COURS DU SOIR,Eyeliner,"a dark, mossy green with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in one stroke, which was buildable to opaque coverage with two to three passes. The consistency was smooth, creamy without being too wet, and comfortable to use on the lower lash line and waterline.",A-
NARS,ALICE,Blush,"a medium, coral-red with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-sheer, buildable color coverage (up to semi-opaque) that had a slightly wet finish and looked more like a cheek stain.",B+
NARS,OLD CHURCH STREET,Palette,"a new, limited edition duo (and formula) that launches April 15th online. The compact is the same size as other NARS‚Äô eyeshadow duos, but the actual quantity is slightly less at 0.10 oz. (compared to 0.14 oz.). The formula felt less powdery and thin compared to most of NARS‚Äô eyeshadows, which I found to be an upgrade overall. This particular duo featured a light, golden copper and blackened teal. The darker shade could have been better, though it was workable.",B+
MAC,ROSY CHEEKS,Blush,"a bright, medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool, fuchsia pearl. It had nearly opaque pigmentation, which was buildable to full coverage, if desired. The texture was soft, smooth, and just a smidgen dusty in the pan (but not applied); I felt like the softness made it easier to control and to grab less product, if desired, so it could be used as sheerer coverage levels without a lot of work. What was even more surprising was how blendable the color was on the cheeks‚Äìit melted and diffused as I applied it and I barely had to blend the edges after laying down the initial color. The finish was luminous but not emphasizing of my pores. The color stayed on well for ten hours before fading.",A
MAC,SWEETS FOR MY SWEET,Blush,"a muted, medium pink with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. The blush had good color payoff that was buildable to truly opaque coverage in two layers. The consistency felt smooth and soft to the touch without being dusty or dry in the pan, but it still blended with ease on my cheeks. It applied evenly, diffused perfectly, and stayed in place for nine hours on my skin.",A
ANASTASIA,ALLISON,Lipstick,"a medium-dark plum with warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. The consistency was smooth, thin but not watery, and spread well across the lips, but the dry down emphasized the texture of my lips and appeared slightly ‚Äúcracked‚Äù along some of my lip lines. It had opaque pigmentation that covered evenly, though, and it lasted for six and a half hours. I noticed some of the color started to flake off after six hours of wear, and it was somewhat drying.",B+
ANASTASIA,DUSTY ROSE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium pinky mauve with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that spread across the lips evenly and smoothly. The texture was thin without being watery, so it was easy to work across the lips but did not sheer out or appear streaky. The dry down resulted in a flat, matte finish that had one or two visible ‚Äúcracks‚Äù at my lip lines but was fairly smooth. This shade wore well for seven hours and felt drying after five hours of wear.",A
ANASTASIA,MADISON,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark magenta purple with warm, pink undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly full color coverage that applied evenly lips. The texture was slightly thinner and had less substance to it compared to most of the Anastasia range, though it did not sheer out or have any issues with streaking. I felt like it was more prone to emphasizing the texture and lines on my lips than normal, but the color didn‚Äôt flake off over time, so the wear was nearly eight hours. It started to feel drying after five hours of wear.",A-
STELLAR BEAUTY,DARK MATTER 02,Lipstick,"a deep, reddish plum with copper and gold pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which was buildable to full coverage with two to three layers. The consistency felt stiffer in the tube, but it applied fairly evenly, though I did use more pressure. The lipstick lasted well for five and a half hours, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a formula I‚Äôd say has all-day wear, just better-than-average wear (though this type of color often wears five to six hours as it is deeper).",B-
STELLAR BEAUTY,DARK MATTER 03,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark plummy brown with a satin finish. It had good color payoff, though not quite opaque, that went on evenly and smoothly, despite tugging on the lips due to the firmer consistency. It was comfortable to wear over the five hours it lasted and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B-
STELLAR BEAUTY,DARK MATTER 04,Lipstick,"a muted, mmedium-dark reddish plum with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that covered the lips evenly. The texture felt firmer, denser, and a little dry initially, but it softened up slightly and didn‚Äôt appear ragged or uneven applied. The formula was lightweight, non-drying, and lasted for five and a half hours on me.",B
NARS,BLINDFOLD,Lipstick,"a dark, berry red with cooler undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage that applied evenly on the lips. The pencil felt smooth, velvety, and thin, which gave it a lightweight feel but made it ‚Äúcling‚Äù a little compared to the typical lipstick. The color was still going strong after six hours of wear, though it started to feel a bit drying after five hours of wear. This shade also left a stain behind.",A-
NARS,LONDON CLINIC,Lipstick,"a muted, medium pink with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied evenly on the lips. The texture was smooth, velvety, and thin, so it never dragged on the lips but felt lightweight on. This particular shade seemed slightly chalky on the lips and ‚Äúcracked‚Äù faintly along my deeper lip lines. It wore well for five and a half hours and was slightly drying after four hours of wear.",B+
MAC,SUPERB,Highlighter,"a muted, medium-dark rosy brown with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. The color seemed to be slightly rosier than the last version of this I had (from a limited edition release). It had excellent color coverage that applied evenly to bare skin. The texture was smooth to the touch without being dry or dusty in the pan. It was easy to apply at full coverage and then diffuse the color or to use a lighter touch for less intense shine. The finish, while nearly metallic, did not accentuate the texture of my skin. This shade wore well for nine hours on me.",A
MAC,"OH, DARLING!",Highlighter,"a light-medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good color payoff paired with a smooth, blendable consistency‚Äìsoft enough to be effortless to use on the skin but not so soft that it became dusty or powdery in the pan. The texture was what made it versatile: I could pick-up less product with a lighter hand for a sheerer coverage, or I could use a normal amount of product and get more intense sheen and color payoff. There was a strong sheen, but it did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs texture. The highlighter wore well for eight and a half hours on me.",A
CLE DE PEAU,105 SERENITY,Palette,"a deep, navy blue paired with a soft platinum. I loved the color combination, but the navy blue could have performed better‚Äìit was a little drier and more prone to sheering out, which could be somewhat uneven in appearance without a good primer underneath it.",B
MAKEUP GEEK,DO-SI-DO,Lipstick,"a light-medium beige with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that covered fairly evenly, but it was slightly tacky and lifted away if I pressed my lips together within the first hour of wear. It looked a lot darker swatched than on my lips, though. The texture was thin, watery, and after it had dried down, it was extremely clingy and made my lips feel tight. The color lasteed for three and a half hours before there were serious pieces totally missing as it flaked off over time. The formula felt fairly drying.",D+
MAKEUP GEEK,CURTSEY,Lipstick,"a light-medium, peachy orange with warm undertones and a matte finish. This was another shade that appeared lighter and more white-based on my lips than swatched‚Äìit appeared almost chalk-like, as it had such a dry, texture-emphasizing dry down. It had semi-opaque color coverage that went on unevenly and looked patchy. The texture was thin, watery, and dried down to a very clingy, uncomfortable feel. The color lasted for three to four hours, but there were big chunks missing as the color flaked off. It was also drying.",D
MAKEUP GEEK,SALSA,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark orange with warm, reddish undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly, though color sunk into my lip lines and there was some streaking along the edges of my lips as I fought to get the color even as it dried down so, so quickly. The texture was uncomfortable to wear, drying, and very clingy, so it appeared ‚Äúcracked‚Äù when I smiled. Some color flaked away over time (it seemed to be the bits between my lip lines), and the formula felt drying over the four hours I wore it for.",C-
NARS,√ÂPH√©LIDE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark plum with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It‚Äôs a new, limited edition formula described as a ‚Äúnatural hint of color with extremely comfortable wear.‚Äù It medium pigmentation that applied fairly evenly across the lips. The product had a thinner, wetter texture going on that immediately developed into a smooth, non-tacky, and gel-like consistency on the lips. It wore well for four and a half hours and was hydrating. There was no discernible scent or taste to the formula.",A-
NARS,DOUBLE DECKER,Lipstick,"a soft, medium red with warm undertones and a jelly-like finish. It had semi-sheer color coverage that went on evenly and made my lips look stained and glossy. The consistency was smooth, non-tacky, and not too thick or too thin, so it didn‚Äôt move around a lot but still felt comfortable to wear. It actually felt more like balm than a gloss, despite having quite a bit of shininess. This shade lasted for four hours on me and was moisturizing.",A-
NARS,PROMISE,Lipstick,"a dark berry with cool undertones and a jelly-like finish. It had medium pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips and didn‚Äôt settle into my lip lines. The consistency felt thin and creamy as I initially applied it, but as soon as I spread the gloss across my lips, it felt smoother, more gel-like, and rather plush. This shade stayed on well for five hours and was hydrating over time.",A-
NARS,RUE ALLENT,Palette,"a new, limited edition duo (and formula) that launches April 15th online. The compact is the same size as other NARS‚Äô eyeshadow duos, but the actual quantity is slightly less at 0.10 oz. (compared to 0.14 oz.). The formula felt less powdery and thin compared to most of NARS‚Äô eyeshadows, which I found to be an upgrade overall. This particular duo featured a soft, warm white and a smoldering, smoky green-tinged brown.",B+
MAC,CHEEKY BITS,Blush,"a bright, medium pink-coral with golden shimmer. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that applied evenly to the cheeks. The powder was smooth, soft, and blendable but never powdery or dusty in the pan (and this type of formula often has a slightly ‚Äúdrier‚Äù feel). I was impressed by just how effortless diffusing this richer shade was! The color stayed on well for nine hours before fading slightly on me.",A
MAC,FAIRLY PRECIOUS,Blush,"a medium, peachy orange with warm undertones and an iridescent pink sheen. This shade was previously released as a Skinfinish, and it seemed to be the same shade as my Skinfinish. It had good color payoff with a strong sheen that did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. It had a soft, smooth, and blendable texture that was easy to work with, and I felt like the finish became more reflective and smoother as I buffed and blended the powder on my cheeks. The blush lasted for nine hours on me before fading slightly.",A
STELLAR BEAUTY,DISCO MOON 04,Lipstick,"a medium, yellow gold with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. It had medium coverage, which did not build well as it seemed to just shift and move the initial layer around and yielded a patchier, more uneven result that didn‚Äôt offer much more coverage. This one might work better for layering than on its own. The texture was rougher compared to most shades in the line-up‚Äìit seemed to have more shimmer and have some larger, glittery particles, too. It lasted for four hours but settled into lip lines and moved around a lot.",C
MAC,LUSTREWHITE,Lipgloss,"a clear gloss with fine white pearl and larger, white sparkle. (Thankfully, MAC listed this one as ‚Äúclear-glazed with white sparkle,‚Äù so the sheerness was as expected.) It had a slightly thinner consistency compared to most of the Lipglasses, though it was still noticeably tackky on the lips. It had semi-sheer coverage with respect to the amount of shimmer in the product. The gloss wore well for three and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",B+
MAC,GAL FRIDAY,Lipgloss,"a pale, grayish white base with iridescent pink shimmer that gave the gloss a subtle shift from fiery coral to cool pink. MAC described this one as ‚Äúpink iridescent clear,‚Äù though it was sheer‚Äìthere was a definite lightening of my natural lip color from the base of the gloss, plus noticeable shimmer. Some of the milkier base color pulled into my lip lines, though it wasn‚Äôt as bad as I would have expected given the lightness of the color. The gloss wore well for three hours and was lightly hydrating.",B-
MAC,GOLDFINCH,Lipgloss,"a sheer, light yellow base paired with a moderate amount of light-medium, yellow gold shimmer. The gloss lightened my natural lip color, and between the base and the shimmer, it had medium coverage (my lip freckle wasn‚Äôt that noticeable!). The texture was smooth‚Äìcouldn‚Äôt feel the shimmer at all‚Äìand moderately tacky. This shade wore well for four hours and was lightly hydrating.",B
MAC,C-THRU,Lipgloss,"a light peach with warm, orange undertones and fine gold pearl. It had semi-opaque color payoff that applied without too much streaking, but a lot of the color pulled into my lip lines and stayed there. The texture was smooth, moderately tacky, and comfortable to wear over the four and a half hours it lasted. It seemed slightly less opaque than the original formula (but mine was from a few years ago).",B-
ANASTASIA,AURORA,Palette,"six, sparkling highlighters that are supposed to have a ‚Äúmetallic‚Äù finish for ‚Äúintense luminosity‚Äù that can be used on ‚Äúeyes, face, and body.‚Äù I noticed shifts in Eclipse, Spectra, Helia, and Lyra, but Luna and Orion were more static, even with contorting my arm to view the swatches at different angles. I found incredibly difficult to capture the shifts noticeably on camera, but the ones I listed previously were visible in person as I turned my head. The shifts were more amplified when layered over blush colors. The formula was soft, smooth, dense but not too firm in the pan, and I felt like they were easy to apply and blend out. The majority of shades were quite pigmented, though a lighter hand or more feathery brush could be used for medium coverage. For me, the wear varied from eight to eight and a half hours across all six shades.",A-
STILA,BALLET BABY,Eyeshadow,"a soft, light pink with subtle, warm undertones and cooler, silver and pink glitter/shimmer. It had semi-sheer to medium coverage that went on fairly evenly. The lighter color made it a little easier to buff and blend out to wear as a wash of shimmer on the lid (on its own), but I think it tended to look its best patted on the inner corner (no swiping maximizes the payoff) or patted over a more opaque eyeshadow or base. Once it dried down, it lasted fairly well for eight hours with minimal fallout.",B-
STILA,BRONZED BELL,Eyeshadow,"a rich, coppery bronze with flecks of gold, silver, and bronze sparkle. It was very pigmented, but it seemed slightly thicker and took longer to dry, so it gathered in the lines on my lid if I wasn‚Äôt careful. I had the best results by applying in a single swiping motion, letting it dry partially, and then dabbing with a clean, synthetic brush to blend any color that had settled, and then letting it finish drying. After it had dried down, the color stayed in place for almost nine hours with slight fallout.",B+
KAT VON D,ROCK CANDY,Palette,"six, miniature-sized lipsticks in the brand‚Äôs Studded Kiss formula. Each lipstick is 0.035 oz., and a full-sized Studded Kiss Lipstick is 0.10 oz. The set contains $44.10 worth of lipstick, so it‚Äôs not a value-packed set in terms of the amount of product, but for those who do not typically finish a lipstick, it is like getting six shades for a little more than the cost of two full-sized lipsticks. The formula on these felt creamier than usual for the Studded Kiss range, which made them easier to apply and more comfortable, but the slightly thicker texture seemed to make them prone to sinking into my lip lines as well.",B+
BURBERRY,FIRST LOVE,Highlighter,"a light-medium pink with warm undertones and a soft, satin sheen. It‚Äôs a limited edition product that I‚Äôve seen pop-up at a few retailers, though not yet at all retailers that typically carry Burberry (at least, not to my knowledge), but it seems to have sold through quickly. The formula is supposed to be ‚Äúeasy to blend and build‚Äù with a ‚Äúluminous‚Äù finish.",B+
STILA,INTO THE BLUE,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark purpled blue with iridescent shimmer and micro-glitter that shifts from cooler blue to brighter violet. The particles used in this shade seemed finer than the average shade in the formula, though it was quite sparkly and reflective. It had a more watery consistency that made it harder to build up, so it tended to have medium coverage at best. The shift was more visible when the product was layered over something more opaque. It wore well for eight hours with minimal fallout.",B
STILA,SEA SIREN,Eyeshadow,"a medium, pink lavender with flecks of greenish-gold, icy lavender, and pink pearl and glitter. It had medium, buildable pigmentation‚Äìto about semi-opaque coverage‚Äìthat applied fairly evenly. When I used a very small, flat brush, I was able to get nearly semi-opaque coverage in one press, but I had to be careful not to blend it out as the texture was a little thin and watery so it sheered out too quickly. This shade shifted to a greenish-gold finish. Once it dried down, the color stayed in place well for eight hours and had slight fallout.",B
STILA,SUNSET COVE,Eyeshadow,"a brighter, medium pinky lavender with warmer pink undertones and a mix of cooler pink, lavender, and violet pearl. It had a more metallic sheen than overtly glittery finish, but it was quite reflective. It had medium, buildable coverage (to semi-opaque coverage) that applied fairly evenly. There was a shift from brighter pink to a cooler lavender that was more prominent when layered over another product. The color lasted for eight and a half hours with slight fallout over time.",B
STELLAR BEAUTY,DISCO MOON 01,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, reddish copper with warm undertones and a fine, metallic sheen. it had nearly opaque color coverage that applied evenly to the lips and didn‚Äôt settle into my lip lines. The consistency was fairly smooth with just a hint of the feel of all the shimmer in it, but it did not feel gritty or rough on the lips. It wore well for five hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
STELLAR BEAUTY,DISCO MOON 02,Lipstick,"a rich, vibrant coral-red with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good pigmentation‚Äìthere was a hint of my lip freckle that came through‚Äìthat applied evenly and smoothly despite having a firmer texture in the tube (firm but not stiff or rough). This shade wore well for six hours and was non-drying, as described.",A
STELLAR BEAUTY,DISCO MOON 03,Lipstick,"a medium, fuchsia pink with cool undertones and lighter pink and lavender shimmer. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which was buildable to opaque coverage with two layers. The consistency was firmer and denser in the tube, but it applied as a thin, even layer (with good coverage) that felt lightweight on. This shade stayed on well for five and a half hours, left a stain behind, and was non-drying.",A-
CLE DE PEAU,104 PURITY,Palette,"a muted, medium-dark mauvey purple paired with a very light pink. The two worked well together for a soft eye look, and there was enough contrast between the two that they could be used as a standalone look. I",B
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,TAN-TASTIC,Bronzer,"a muted, medium-dark brown with neutral-to-warm, red undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had good pigmentation, which was buildable to full coverage with less than two layers. The consistency was smooth, denser in the pan but not so firm that it was a challenge to get product to transfer onto a brush. It certainly would work with the coordinating, limited edition Bronze brush, but it worked just as fine with other blush and bronzer brushes I have. The bronzer wore well for eight and a half hours on me.",A-
MAC,JUSTINE SKYE,Highlighter,"a muted, medium-dark plummy purple with subtle, warm undertones and flecks of lavender sparkle and fine pearl shimmer. The Iridescent Powder is supposed to give a ‚Äúhint of soft purple for cheeks with a shimmering pink pearl sheen‚Äù that has ‚Äúbuildable coverage‚Äù and is ‚Äúlong-wearing.‚Äù The consistency was incredibly dense‚Äìfirmly packed and required a denser brush or slight jabbing motions to get enough product onto the brush. The denser texture made it harder to blend out on the skin as the product tended to go on unevenly, so it took more work to diffuse the color evenly across the cheeks. It had semi-sheer, buildable coverage (up to semi-opaque) that lasted for seven and a half hours on me.",B-
MAC,DUA LIPA,Lipgloss,"a clear gloss with flecks of iridescent sparkle. MAC actually described it as a ‚Äúclear gloss with multi-pearl,‚Äù so it was as described. The sparkle was rather sparse, so they did not distribute that evenly across the lips and had little impact on (layered or alone). The formula was smooth, creamy without being heavy, and non-sticky. It wore well for two hours and was hydrating.",B
MAC,FIRST WAVES,Blush,"a light-medium pink with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. The finish became slightly more luminous once blended out on the skin but did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. The powder had a silvery white, coral-red, and fuchsia pink, while a lot of the shimmer comes off with the first use, as it was an overspray.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,FOXTROT,Lipstick,"a medium, peachy pink with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage that didn‚Äôt look too patchy, but it was noticeably streaky, even after it had fully dried down. The consistency was thin, watery, and dried down very quickly, so it was hard to correct any mistakes. It lasted for four hours on me and was slightly drying.",C+
MAKEUP GEEK,JITTERBUG,Lipstick,"a bright, medium coral-orange with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied unevenly and had noticeable streakiness. After it dried down, it looked ‚Äúcracked‚Äù when I smiled, and this one flaked off within an hour of wear. There were just large chunks of product that came away, and I hadn‚Äôt had anything to eat or drink, so it was unexpected. It wore for two and a half hours before it had just looked horrendous, and it was extremely drying and tight to wear.",F
MAKEUP GEEK,TANGO,Lipstick,"Makeup Geek Tango Showstopper Creme Stain ($12.00 for 0.19 fl. oz.) is a bright, medium coral-red with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage that applied decently, though there was a bit of streaking and some unevenness‚Äìthe brightness of the color helped distract from those things, though. The texture was thinner, very quick to dry, and clingy on the lips. This shade lasted for five hours and was drying over time.",C+
MAC,FORTUNE RED,Lipgloss,"a medium red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a jelly-like finish. It had medium to semi-opaque, buildable color coverage that went on evenly and didn‚Äôt gather in my lip lines. The consistency was thinner than the average Lipglass, which I expect was partially due to the packaging have a tighter opening that made it so less product was on the doe-foot applicator. It was still moderately tacky as the Lipglass formula typically is. The gloss lasted for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A-
MAC,PEACH BLOSSOM PINK,Lipgloss,"a medium, fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly, but there was noticeable color that had welled in my lip lines. The high-shine finish made that less noticeable from a normal viewing distance, though. The consistency was slightly thin compared to most Lipglass shades I‚Äôve tried, but it spread well and was still moderately tacky, so the wear was longer at nearly five hours. The formula was lightly hydrating on me.",B+
MAC,GLOW WITH IT,Highlighter,"a muted, rosy brown with fine, golden shimmer. There was an almost plummy tone to it when blended out, but it seemed more brown than plum overall. For a Skinfinish, it actually had less shimmer‚Äìand finer shimmer at that‚Äìcompared to the majority of Skinfinishes I‚Äôve tried. It absolutely still gave a glow to the skin, but it was easier to be heavy-handed and not worry about emphasizing my skin‚Äôs natural texture. It had great color payoff with a very smooth, soft, and blendable texture; it felt like the perfect balance between soft and firm where it was easy to grab product with a brush but not at all dusty in the pan. The color wore well for eight and a half hours on me.",A
MAC,FORTUNE,Palette,"a light pewter and a matte medium pink housed in a slim compact. It‚Äôs a more unique color combination, but it was harder to work with the two shades alone as the matte was thinner and the pewter was more sparkly and had less base color.",B
COLOUR POP,BELLE OF THE BALL,Palette,"a pink-themed set of shades with two warmer, pinky-coral shades and then a deep, cooler pink and a light, frosty pink. The four shades worked well together‚Äìeven the more shimmery shade layered well with the more matte shades in the palette‚Äìand performed nicely.",A-
ANASTASIA,DAZED,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark red with warm, brown undertones and a matte finish. It was intensely pigmented and yielded opaque coverage in a single layer. The consistency was smooth, thin but not watery, and easy to spread across the lips for even application. It dried down to a totally matte, transfer-proof finish quickly but not so quickly that you had to work fast to apply it. The liquid lipstick wore nicely for almost eight hours and started to feel drying after five hours of wear.",A
ANASTASIA,CURRANT,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark red with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied beautifully to the lips with even, smooth coverage. The liquid lipstick felt smooth, thin enough not to feel heavy or pool on the lips, but thick enough that it spread without sheering out or becoming streaky. The formula felt drying after six hours of wear, though the color was still going strong after eight hours of wear.",A
MAC,DYNASTY RED,Lipstick,"a bright, medium red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage that covered the lips evenly. The texture was denser but velvety, so the lipstick glided across the lips with ease and never dragged despite having a more matte finish. The color was still going strong after six hours of wear, and it only started to feel a bit drying after five hours of wear.",A
MAC,PEACH BLOSSOM PINK,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. It had very nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. The consistency was lightweight, creamy enough not to drag, but it stayed in place throughout the day. This shade wore well for five hours and left a slight stain behind, though it was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
MAC,ALL YEAR RED,Blush,"a vibrant, medium poppy red with warm, orange undertones and a natural finish. It had rich, opaque color coverage‚Äìa little went a long way‚Äìwith a smooth, moderately emollient consistency that was thin, lightly tacky, and had a natural finish. I found that this particular shade seemed to dry down a bit more than most Cream Colour Bases after a few minutes, so it had more of a ‚Äúnatural matte‚Äù finish on my cheeks. Though the formula is supposed to be buildable, this particular shade is very pigmented, and I‚Äôd say that to get sheerer coverage takes an incredibly light hand and a fair amount of blending. Medium coverage was easier to obtain with using a light hand and just blending and diffusing the edges with a stippling brush or fingertips. It wore well for nine hours on me before fading noticeably.",A-
COLOuR POP,BLOW ME AWAY,Palette,"a mix of warm peaches, corals, and oranges. Two of the four shades (Centerfold, Slim Fit) are not actually eyeshadows, they are ‚ÄúPressed Pigments,‚Äù which are listed as ‚Äúnot intended for use in the immediate eye area‚Äù (in the same way that we have seen for some Make Up For Ever Artist Shadows, Urban Decay‚Äôs Electric Palette, and so forth). I did not make that connection when I initially used and tested the palette, which is why you‚Äôll find some shades are applied to my eye.",A-
CLE DE PEAU,103 HARMONY,Palette,"a darker green and a lighter, warmer green. I think the selection of shades is more versatile in this duo than some of the others, as there is a good level of contrast between the two shades as well as a difference in shimmer.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,GOLD DUST,Bronzer,"a muted, medium-dark brown with warm, red undertones and a satin finish. It had medium, buildable pigmentation that was opaque after two layers. The consistency was smooth, dense in the pan, but remained blendable on the skin and never felt like a stiff or dry powder. The more I blended out the bronzer, the more luminous the finish became‚Äìglowing but not shimmery. The bronzer wore well for nine hours before fading slightly on me.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,TERRA,Bronzer,"a muted, medium brown with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. This shade had the most matte finish of the three, though there was still a natural finish to it that kept it from looking dry or flat on the skin. It had semi-opaque, buildable color payoff that applied evenly and smoothly to the skin. The powder was denser but very blendable, which made it easy to sheer out or build-up for greater coverage. It wore well for nine and a half hours on me.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,BRONZE AGE,Bronzer,"a medium, golden brown with warm undertones and a satin sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that blended out easily on bare skin. The powder was denser, very smooth to the touch, where most bronzer brushes I tried grabbed medium to semi-opaque coverage with a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù pressure, so if you prefer sheerer coverage, use a blush brush or a lighter hand. There was no powderiness or excess product kicked up in the pan due to the powder‚Äôs density, but it wasn‚Äôt stiff to work with, which is where these denser formulations excel. It lasted for ten hours on me before fading.",A
COLOUR POP,THE KNOCKOUT,Palette,"two large face powders‚Äìa blush and highlighter‚Äìhoused in a cardboard palette with an interior mirror. The blush formula is supposed to have ‚Äúlong-wear‚Äù with a ‚Äúsoft‚Äù and ‚Äúsilky‚Äù feel that ‚Äúcan be layered for your desired intensity.‚Äù The highlighter formula is supposed to have ‚Äúhigh-shine‚Äù with a ‚Äúbuttery-soft‚Äù feel that has ‚Äúhigh colour intensity.‚Äù The two shades coordinated well with each other, and despite the difference in textures, actually layered nicely.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,BUNNY HOP,Lipstick,"bright, medium-dark pink with cooler undertones and a matte finish. It had medium coverage, which was hard to build up as the first layer pulled up and became very patchy and uneven when I tried to put on a second layer. The consistency was smooth, thin, but it spread decetnly across the lips and only had some streaking. It lasted for four and a half hours before fading strongly from the center first, and the formula was slightly drying.",C+
MAKEUP GEEK,MOONWALK,Lipstick,"a medium, cotton candy pink with cooler undertones and a matte finish. It had medium color payoff that applied unevenly to the lips, and it was not buildable as the color did not layer well and often would lift parts of the first layer off (which made it look even worse). The consistency ran thinner, almost watery, and it was difficult to spread the product far on the lips as there was so little product on the applicator. On me, the color lasted for four and a half hours and was slightly drying.",D
MAKEUP GEEK,CHA CHA,Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. This was one of the more pigmented shades in the range‚Äìalmost opaque!‚Äìand applied evenly with some streaking along the edges (even after it had dried down). The consistency was thin, dried down very quickly, and emphasized the natural texture of my lips. It wore well for four and a half hours and was somewhat drying.",B-
CLE DE PEAU,102 CALM,Palette,"a medium, warm-toned pink and a light, pinky-peach. The two created a rather soft look, so I‚Äôm not sure if it will create a perfect one-and-done look for everyone, but if you like your pinks and are normally a fan of the softness of the Cle de Peau formula, you may enjoy it.",B
COLOUR POP,DONE DEAL,Palette,"two large face powders‚Äìa blush and highlighter‚Äìhoused in a cardboard palette with an interior mirror. The blush formula is supposed to have ‚Äúlong-wear‚Äù with a ‚Äúsoft‚Äù and ‚Äúsilky‚Äù feel that ‚Äúcan be layered for your desired intensity.‚Äù The highlighter formula is supposed to have ‚Äúhigh-shine‚Äù with a ‚Äúbuttery-soft‚Äù feel that has ‚Äúhigh colour intensity.‚Äù The blush had sheerer coverage that was buildable, but the texture was very dusty and prone to making a mess inside the palette, while the highlighter worked better on the skin than anticipated.",B+
TOO FACED,NATURAL LOVE,Palette,"30 eyeshadows in varying shades of pinks, golds, and various neutral tones with some mattes and many shimmers. It‚Äôs housed in a large, cardboard palette and includes several shades from past neutral palettes they‚Äôve released along with ‚Äúbrand new‚Äù shades.",B-
COLOUR POP,LIKELY,Lipstick,"a muted, light-medium peachy, brown with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had good color payoff that applied decently, but this was one of the streakier shades that was released recently. The formula seemed to run thinner and had less substance to it, which may have been why it looked streaky. It lasted for five and a half hours, but it was slightly drying after four hours of wear and started to pull into my lip lines at the same time.",B-
COLOUR POP,EXAGGERATED,Lipstick,"a muted, peachy orange with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had a smooth consistency that was thin without being watery, so it spread easily across the lips and laid down nearly opaque, even coverage. After an hour of wear, the lipstick felt a little chalky on me, though it did not appear dry. This shade wore well for over six hours and was non-drying.",A-
COLOUR POP,JACQUARD,Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange-coral with strong, warm undertones and a lightly glossy finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied fairly well, though there was a touch of streaking and very small areas where the color did not seem to go as opaquely as most of my lips. The formula felt smooth going on, thin but not watery, and comfortable to wear for the first four hours. The lipstick was still going strong after six hours but had started to feel drying.",A-
COLOUR POP,HEAVY HITTER,Palette,"a more muted, warm-toned, neutral set of shades. All four shades performed well and were fairly easy to use, had good pigmentation, and lasted seven to eight hours on me.",B+
COLOUR POP,FRESH CUT,Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with neutral undertones and a matte finish. It was richly pigmented and spread evenly across the lips. I had no trouble getting crisper lines with little effort, but as it dried down, the final finish emphasized the natural texture of my lips and appeared slightly ‚Äúcracked‚Äù when I smiled. I expected it to be rather drying, but after seven hours of wear, it looked mostly intact and wasn‚Äôt drying at all!",A-
COLOUR POP,LOVE MUFFIN,Lipstick,"a medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable color coverage that did not apply as evenly as the majority of shades have in this formula. I also felt like the texture itself was chalky as it settled on the lips, even though the initial consistency was thin, liquid, and spreadable. The color started to pull apart and emphasize my lip lines after an hour and a half of wear. It lasted for closer to five hours overall, and it was slightly drying.",B-
COLOUR POP,CHANDELIER,Lipstick,"a medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had good color coverage, though it wasn‚Äôt quite opaque in a single layer, that went on evenly. I had a small amount of product that settled into my lip lines, which was more noticeable when I smiled (almost like when a matte, liquid lipstick ‚Äúcracks‚Äù). The texture was thin but not watery, a little runny in a way, but it spread well and wasn‚Äôt hard to control in practice. This shade stayed on well for six and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
COLOUR POP,EGO,Eyeshadow,"a light brown with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good color coverage, which went on evenly, but the texture ran a little dry and dusty, so I had a bit of fallout during application and felt like some of the shimmer pulled away as I blended it out. It started to fade on me after seven and a half hours of wear.",B
COLOUR POP,CONUNDRUM,Eyeshadow,"a soft, medium brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation‚Äìjust a bit shy of full coverage‚Äìthat applied to bare skin evenly and was easy to blend and diffuse. The consistency was soft, a touch dusty in the pan, but it did not appear dry on the skin nor did it sheer out too easily. It wore nicely for eight hours before fading on me.",A-
COLOUR POP,BOXER,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, bronzy brown with a frosted sheen. It had rich, opaque color payoff with a soft, smooth consistency that wasn‚Äôt too dense or too soft in the pan, so it was easy to pick up with any brush but didn‚Äôt have any excess product kicked up in the pan. This shade applied evenly and lasted for eight hours on me.",A-
COLOUR POP,PEBBLES,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium-dark pinky coral with strong, warm undertones and a soft, frosted sheen. It had excellent pigmentation that applied decently to the lid, but the texture of this seemed a little stiffer in practice, though I did not notice it just by touching the eyeshadow! I had to work at it to get it to go on evenly and maintain its vibrancy. It wore well for seven hours before fading on me.",B-
COLOUR POP,LABYRINTH,Eyeshadow,"a soft, medium rosy pink with strong, warm undertones and a matte finish. The texture was slightly dusty in the pan, but it applied fairly well to bare skin‚Äìgood coverage, even application, and still blendable without losing its intensity. I did, however, find that it appeared lighter swatched/applied than it did in the pan. On me, it wore well for seven and a half hours.",B+
COLOUR POP,POODLE,Eyeshadow,"a medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had medium coverage, which was buildable to semi-opaque pigmentation over bare skin. With a primer, it could be built up to opaque coverage. The consistency was more powdery and prone to sheering out, which is why primer was such a help with this partiucular shade. The color started to fade after seven hours of wear.",C
COLOUR POP,CUT OUTS,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium coral-orange with warm undertones and a matte finish. The eyeshadow had a very smooth, silky texture‚Äìsoft enough that there was some excess powder that kicked up in the pan when I used it‚Äìthat applied evenly on bare skin. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that lasted for eight hours.",A-
ANASTASIA,CLOVER,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, grayish purple with cool undertones and a flat, matte finish. It did seem to lighten on my lips compared to swatched, and it looked quite different swatched/applied compared to how it appeared in the tube! It makes me think that it will look a little different across skin tones and undertones. The liquid lipstick was richly pigmented with full coverage in a single layer, and the color spread evenly across the lips without streaking. It dried down with enough time to spread the product but not have to sit around waiting for it dry over an hour. This shade wore well for seven hours and was slightly drying after five hours of wear.",A
COLOUR POP,DOUBLE PLAY,Palette,"two large face powders‚Äìa blush and highlighter‚Äìhoused in a cardboard palette with an interior mirror. The blush formula is supposed to have ‚Äúlong-wear‚Äù with a ‚Äúsoft‚Äù and ‚Äúsilky‚Äù feel that ‚Äúcan be layered for your desired intensity.‚Äù The highlighter formula is supposed to have ‚Äúhigh-shine‚Äù with a ‚Äúbuttery-soft‚Äù feel that has ‚Äúhigh colour intensity.‚Äù If you prefer your blushes buildable, then you might like the blush in this palette, but if you want true-to-pan color and coverage in one layer, I‚Äôd skip the duo. The highlighter had a more metallic finish with some sparkle but a lighter touch can get more subdued results.",B
MAKEUP GEEK,ARABESQUE,Lipstick,"light-medium, pinky lavender with warm undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was thin, almost watery, but this one actually spread better across the lips compared to many shades. It had more even, semi-opaque coverage, though it dried down with some streakiness and looked ‚Äúcracked‚Äù when I smiled as the color separated at my lip lines. This shade lasted for four hours and was slightly drying.",B-
MAKEUP GEEK,GRAPEVINE,Lipstick,"a brighter, medium purple with warm, pink undertones and a matte finish. It had medium pigmentation that took four pulls of product to get a single layer of product for my lips, as there appeared to be very little product that stayed on the applicator at a given moment. The consistency was prone to sheering out and went on very unevenly with color that gathered in my lip lines and appeared ‚Äúcracked‚Äù when I smiled. This shade lasted for four and a half hours before there was significant fading at the center of the mouth, and it was slightly drying.",D+
MAKEUP GEEK,CHARLESTON,Lipstick,"a medium-dark purple with warm, pink undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-sheer to medium coverage, which did not build well, as it caused the initial layer to pull up and resulted in more uneven coverage than with just one layer applied. The texture was thin, almost watery, and it was difficult to spread out before it started to dry down. The formula lasted for four and a half hours and was slightly drying.",D
COLOUR POP,STRIP,Lipstick,"a muted, medium peachy brown with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly across the lips. The consistency was thin but with substance, so there was plenty of coverage while it was still spreadable. The formula on this shade seemed to be a little drier than most Ultra Satins, which became more noticeable after three hours of wear as the color itself started to look more matte and more like a traditional liquid lipstick. The lipstick lasted for nearly six and a half hours but was drying over time. The scent of this also seemed to be much waxier than I recall as well, though I did not notice any scent once I applied it to my lips.",A-
COLOUR POP,STRUT,Lipstick,"a medium-dark taupe brown with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had a smooth, thin texture that spread well across the lips but had enough density that it yielded full color coverage in a single layer. The formula was comfortable to wear over the six and a half hours it lasted and only felt slightly drying in the last hour of wear. I did have a bit of color that had pulled into my lip lines noticeably after four hours of wear, but I could smooth the color out by rubbing my lips together (one of the perks of the Ultra Satin formula!).",A
WET 'N' WILD,PRECIOUS PETALS,Highlighter,"a medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. It was a stronger, more obvious highlighter, so it would be best suited for someone who prefers intense highlighting over subtle highlighting. There was slight emphasis of my skin‚Äôs natural texture when worn at medium or higher coverage.",A
WET 'N' WILD,CROWN OF MY CANOPY,Highlighter,"a muted, medium-dark copper with warm, golden undertones and flecks of pink and gold micro-glitter and shimmer. This shade had more visible glitter on the skin compared to Precious Petals. The consistency was also less smooth, drier, and more prone to sheering out. What I found was that I could buff and blend out the color so that it appeared smooth on my cheekbones, and when I did that, there were very few glitters left. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading.",C+
COLOUR POP,BIRDY,Lipstick,"a light-medium pink with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly well to lips, though there was very slight streaking at times (especially if I pressed my lips together, then I could see a faint ‚Äúline‚Äù). The consistency was creamy, smooth, and comfortable to apply and to wear as it never tugged on the lips. The color wore well for three hours and was lightly moisturizing.",B
COLOUR POP,OVERSIZED,Lipstick,"a slightly muted, medium orange with a hint of pink and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly across the lips, though there was just a touch of streaking along the edges. It had a creamy, glide-on texture that was thick enough that it kept the more emollient formula from immediately settling into my lip lines. I did, however, have some color that pulled into my lip lines after two and a half hours of wear. The lipstick stayed on well for almost four hours and was hydrating.",B+
COLOUR POP,FADED,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark rosy plum with strong, warm undertones and a creamy, lightly glossy finish. It had rich, opaque color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. The consistency was slightly thicker (but not really thick), creamy, and felt like it melted as I glided the lipstick across my lips. This shade wore well for five hours with slight settling over time, though the formula was lightly hydrating.",A
TARTE,FAIRYTALE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark blue-leaning aqua with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which was buildable to opaque with two to three layers. The consistency was thin and spreadable, but it applied streakily and had a tendency to pull into lip lines as it was drying down.",C
TARTE,FESTIVAL,Lipstick,"a muted, medium rosy mauve with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. The consistency was thin but not watery, and it spread well and did not look streaky at any point. It dried down to a flat, matte finish that lasted for almost six hours. The formula was slightly drying over time.",A
MAC,COLD FRONT,Lipstick,"a muted, grayish lavender with cool undertones and fine pearl. It had medium pigmentation, which was somewhat buildable, but it did not apply as evenly as it should have, so it was harder to wear it on its own but would perform better layered on top of something to add shine and coolness. The consistency was slightly more shimmery in feel, though I would not have described it was rough. This shade wore well for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",C+
MAC,ROYAL HOUR,Lipstick,"a slightly muted, medium-dark purple with warmer, pink udnertones and cooler blue and violet pearl. It also had slightly larger violet sparkle, which gave the lipstick a more noticeable texture when applied directly from the tube (though it wasn‚Äôt painful or uncomfortable to use). It had semi-opaque color coverage, which applied fairly evenly, but some of the larger particles bunched up and made areas look ‚Äúchunky‚Äù to a small degree. It wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing.",B
MAC,METAL HEAD,Lipstick,"a muted, medium black with neutral-to-warm undertones and multi-colored, fine pearl. As it was semi-sheer in coverage, it tinted and darkened my lips but did not look like black as it did in the swatch‚Äìthe end result for me was more like a muted burgundy with a hint of purple. The lipstick had moderate slip and was slightly thinner, and I wasn‚Äôt able to apply it as evenly as I would have liked. The color stayed on well for four hours with some settling into my lip lines over time. The formula felt slightly hydrating.",C
TARTE,REVEL,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark red with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had good color coverage‚Äìjust shy of opaque‚Äìthat applied evenly and smoothly on the lid. The texture was soft, a smidgen loose so there was some excess product kicked up in the pan, but it was easy to work with as it was blendable and adhered well to bare skin. It lasted for eight hours on me before fading.",A-
TARTE,POP ROCK,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium, pink-leaning coral with a strong, golden sheen. It had good pigmentation, though it wasn‚Äôt as opaque as other shades in the range, and the texture had chunkier shimmer so it wasn‚Äôt as smooth as other shades. It was still quite soft, blendable, and did not feel gritty/chunky in the pan, but it definitely seemed different than past iterations in this formula. On me, the color wore well for seven and a half hours before fading.",B+
TARTE,CLUELESS,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, coppery brown with warm undertones and a sparkling, frosted finish. It was less metallic and more frosted as the shimmer particles were larger and more noticeable. The consistency was fairly smooth, soft without being too dusty or powdery in the pan, and blendable on the skin. It had great color payoff that lasted for eight hours on me.",A-
TARTE,VINTAGE,Eyeshadow,"a molten, golden copper with warm undertones and a metallic finish. It was incredibly pigmented with a very soft texture; so soft that it was looser and was best applied using less product than normal and patting/pressing into the skin, which helped the product meld against the skin. There was some fallout during application, but it really blended and worked well into the skin and retained its vibrancy. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading.",A-
TARTE,JADED,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, olive green with strong, warm undertones and a golden sheen. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, lightly dense texture that was almost cream-like as it was silky and easy to work with. The eyeshadow applied beautifully to bare skin and lasted for eight hours.",A
URBAN DECAY,FEVER,Lipgloss,"a light-medium, coral-orange with warm undertones (a mix of red and orange) paired with pink and silver sparkle. The consistency was thin, not watery but could have easier to spread across the lips (may have been unnecessary hindered by the terrible choice in applicator, though). Of the shades in the line-up, I actually felt like this one looked pretty good alone, as there was enough overall sheen to make it look even while still adding plenty of sparkle. I tried layering it over a Vice Lipstick, and it did not go on as well; it seemed to dry down and ‚Äúcrack‚Äù the underlying lipstick and create a tackiness that lifted color after I pressed my lips together (barely!). On its own, Fever wore well for four hours but was somewhat drying. Go figure that one that worked well on its own would have trouble layering, right?",B
URBAN DECAY,RITUAL,Lipgloss,"a muted, blackened navy blue with silver and blue sparkle. It was terrible over bare lips, as it was clear just how patchy and uneven the application was. This shade would work best over deeper, vampier shades, where the base color would help camouflage the patchiness. The consistency was thin, watery, and cooling (and tingling) when applied to bare lips with less noticeable tingling when applied over another lip product. On its own, the product lasted for three hours on me but was slightly drying. When I tried layering it over a berry-hued shade, it created ‚Äúcracks‚Äù when I smiled and made the finished result lightly tacky. The color absorbed a lot of the unevenness, but I think the texture was too thick to showcase the shimmer/sparkle effect.",D+
URBAN DECAY,CIRCUIT,Lipgloss,"a blackened green with subtle, warmer undertones and flecks of cooler and warmer green glitter and shimmer. It had incredibly sheer coverage, which wasn‚Äôt quite as patchy as other deeper shades, but it still looked awful on its own as color pulled into lip lines, and it looked a little like I had pressed my lips into potting soil. From far away, enough light reflected that it looked almost cool. I had thought this one might work well with Urban Decay‚Äôs Studded lipstick to make it even more oil-slick like, but it was another failed pairing as it just made the overall finish patchy and uneven, though the color/effect was interesting (so perhaps with a lip liner underneath). On its own, it lasted for two and a half hours and was non-drying.",D
LIPSTICK QUEEN,MORNIN' SUNSHINE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with subtle, warm undertones and a natural finish. It had semi-sheer color that looked more like a lip stain than a lipstick applied.",A-
MAC,SPANK ME SANTA,Lipstick,"a medium, rosy plum with warmer undertones and a satin finish. It had rich color coverage in a single layer, which applied evenly and didn‚Äôt tug or drag on my lips during application. The texture was lightweight, firmer in the tube but had enough creaminess to be comfortable to apply. The color stayed on well for five hours and was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",A
MAC,PEACHY PETER,Lipstick,"a light peach with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque color payoff that applied fairly evenly, though the product seemed to gather a bit in my lip lines. It wasn‚Äôt too noticeable from a normal viewing distance, luckily. The texture was lightweight, a bit drier and firmer in the tube that gave it a chalkier feel as it tugged a bit while I applied it. It wore well for four hours but settled further into my lip lines over time and was non-drying.",C+
MAC,SLAY RIDE,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark red with strong, cool blue undertones and a satin finish. It had excellent pigmentation with opaque coverage delivered in a single stroke. The lipstick glided easily across my lips but never felt too slippery, which helped keep it in place as I experienced no feathering or bleeding over time. The consistency was lightweight, thin without being clingy, and had enough creaminess to apply comfortably. This shade was still going strong after six hours of wear and was lightly hydrating over time.",A
MAC,OMIGAUD IT'S GOLD,Eyeshadow,"a dirty, deep gold with warm, brownish undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. It had medium, buildable coverage when used dry, and if opacity was wanted, I‚Äôd recommend using it with a dampened brush. The consistency was loose, finely-milled, and fairly easy to work with as the powder pressed onto bare skin well with just a touch of fallout. I was able to build and blend out the loose product on my lid without a fuss. It lasted well for eight hours regardless of whether I applied it dry or wet.",A-
MAC,PATRICKSTARRR,Eyeshadow,"a medium copper with warm, rusty undertones and a sparkling sheen. It had medium, buildable coverage when applied dry, which applied evenly and blended out nicely along the edges. When I used it with a dampened brush, it had richer, more opaque coverage in a single layer and had a more pearly finish with flecks of larger micro-sparkle apparent. The texture was finely-milled and sat well on my skin with minimal fallout during application. It wore well for eight hours both wet and dry.",A-
MAC,TWINKLING LIGHTS,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium copper with strong, warm gold shimmer and a sparkling, metallic finish. It had a slightly drier, chunkier consistency that made it harder to use dry, as it had a tendency to sheer out and have fallout during application. When I used it with a dampened brush (just with water), the powder became more unified and yielded opaque coverage with a smoother sheen, which made it a lot easier to work with. The edges were blendable both wet and dry, though. It stayed on well for six hours dry and eight hours when applied with a dampened brush.",C+
MAC,HOT COCO BISH,Lipgloss,"a light-medium, golden brown with warm undertones and flecks of gold sparkle. It had more of a smattering of sparkle than what I‚Äôd expect for the Dazzleglass formula, which is, as the name might suggest, supposed to be rather dazzling. The consistency was light-medium in thickness with moderate tackiness, though it was spreadable and hydrating while worn. It had semi-sheer coverage, which is fairly in line with how it‚Äôs marketed. The gloss lasted for four hours on me.",B
MAC,RIDE MY SLEIGH,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium red with warm undertones and flecks of red and gold sparkle. It had medium coverage, as expected based on the formula‚Äôs description, that covered somewhat unevenly, though it didn‚Äôt seem to gather in my lip lines noticeably. The consistency was thicker, so I didn‚Äôt feel the texture from the sparkles in it. While MAC claims it‚Äôs non-sticky, I find Dazzleglass to be one of the tackier formulas on the market. On me, it wore well for five hours and was hydrating over time.",B+
MAC,SANTA GOT MONEYYY,Lipgloss,"a gold-tinted base with flecks of medium-dark sparkle. It had the most sparkle of the glosses in the launch‚Äìmore medium in ‚Äúcoverage‚Äù with a translucent base. The texture was light-medium in thickness with a tacky feel on my lips, which I found spreadable and smooth, so it wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable for me and kept the sparkles suspended in the gloss base (rather than me feeling the texture of them). The gloss stayed on nicely for five hours and was moisturizing while worn.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,108 BURGUNDY,Eyeshadow,"a reddish-copper base with blue-to-tea shifting sparkle/pearl. There was a noticeable shift at times, though I found it had the most noticeable shift as a cheek color and less of a shift as an eyeshadow (but very sparkling!). The texture felt like a mix of loose powder eyeshadow and glitter, so it didn‚Äôt feel finely-milled or silky as there was quite a bit of larger sparkles in it that gave it a more textured, drier feel. It had more semi-sheer, buildable pigmentation I used it dry and more medium to opaque coverage when I used it with a wet brush (depending on how much product I picked up). It worked best applied with a dampened brush or over a tacky base, like liquid foundation to use it as a cheek color or setting spray as an eye color. When I wore it alone as an eyeshadow, most of the color was intact after eight hours but there was some fallout. When I wore it with an adhesive spray, it lasted for eight hours with minimal fallout.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,PHOTOSYNTHESEX,Palette,"a new, permanent set of shades featuring a shimmery gold, shifting teal, muted plum, and matte teal. The color concept is very cool and interesting to see, particularly for a permanent product. I highly recommend giving the color combo a try with shades you may already own. The quality of the quad was a little too up and down for me, and at this price point, I would expect more consistency in quality.",B+
COVER FX,LIGHT-MEDIUM,Palette,"two powder highlighters and two cream highlighters housed in a cardboard palette. The cream formula is supposed to have a ‚Äúdewy, radiant glow,‚Äù while the powder highlighters have a ‚Äúsilky, luminous finish.‚Äù Overall, the four shades included have more of a subtle to light sheen, so the palette would be best for someone who liked lighter, golden hues and subtle highlighters.",B+
MAC,ZEROCOOL,Lipstick,"a medium, springy green with warm, yellow undertones and fine emerald green and gold pearl. I had such hopes for this shade, but it had a lot of slip, which gave it a glossier finish and made it harder to apply, as it was slightly streaky and applied unevenly. There was also color that slipped into my lip lines, which worsened over time. It had medium coverage, which did not build up well due to the amount of slip (just seemed to make the end result look streakier). The lipstick wore well for three and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing.",D+
MAC,ANYTHING ONCE,Lipstick,"a muted, blackened navy blue with fine blue and violet pearl. The texture was thinner but had a fair amount of slip, which led to a patchy, uneven application that made it hard to wear on its own. Like other shades in the range, this would be most suitable for layering over another shade rather than using it on its own. It had semi-sheer coverage, which was not buildable, and it lasted for three hours. The formula felt very slightly hydrating overall.",D-
MAC,NIGHTLY RITUAL,Lipstick,"a purplish black with fine teal, silver, and green pearl. It had semi-sheer color coverage, so the end result darkened my natural lip color substantially but may look cooler or warmer depending on what your natural lip color looks like. The texture had moderate slip, which may have been why the lipstick did not apply as evenly as it could have. I struggled to get the product to adhere as well to the inner areas of my lips (more so than average). It wore well for four hours but had issues where the color pulled into lip lines over time. It was lightly hydrating, though! This is definitely one that would work better layered over something else.",D+
MAC,JUPITER,Lipstick,"a medium-dark brown with warm, reddish undertones and a fine, golden sheen. It had semi-sheer pigmentation that was buildable to medium coverage. The lipstick felt smooth with some slip, so it was comfortable to apply and did not drag. The distribution of shimmer could have been slightly better, though, and I think that some of the unevenness is camouflaged by the mid-tone nature of the shade (blended in more with my natural lip color). It wore well for three and a half hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B-
MAC,MODERN MIDAS,Lipstick,"a medium brown with warm, golden undertones and pink and gold pearl. It had sheer color coverage that applied fairly evenly, though I wish it had been a bit more buildable as the shimmer was quite fine that it could easily get lost layered over anything that had more slip than a matte (or was thicker/denser in texture). The lipstick was thinner and felt more like Lustre to me. It lasted for just over two and a half hours and was non-drying.",C-
MAC,ACT SO COOL,Lipstick,"deep, reddish brown with fine gold, copper, and almost greenish-gold pearl. It had semi-opaque color payoff, which was somewhat buildable beyond that. The texture had moderate slip, and with the deeper color, there was slight patchiness that was visible and some lines where I could see the color had deepened there. This shade wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",B
TARTE,MAKE BELIEVE IN YOURSELF,Palette,"ten eyeshadows and one highlighter. housed in a circular compact with a large mirror inside. The formula is supposed to have a ‚Äúsilky-soft‚Äù texture and a ‚Äúlong-lasting finish without any fallout or chalkiness.‚Äù Across the board, the formula featured a denser powder texture, where there was no excess product kicked up in the pan and often using a patting/pushing motion with brushes was better than gently sweeping for picking up product onto a brush. There were a few that I think would work best with flat, synthetic brushes rather than anything fluffy (like Wings and Marvel).",B
ESTEE LAUDER,CANDY,Lipstick,"a medium pink with cooler undertones and a lot of white frosted shimmer. It had semi-opaque color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. It had a thinner, clingier feel on the lips, though it was never uncomfortable nor was it drying (it was lightly hydrating, actually!). The color wore well for just over four and a half hours on me.",B+
ESTEE LAUDER,BLUSH TEASE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in one layer, so not what I‚Äôd call buildable, but the color went on fairly evenly. The texture seemed more emollient and slightly heavier/thicker in feel compared to others in the range‚Äìmore like a cross between the Hi-Lustre and original Pure Color Envy Sculpting ranges. It wore well for four and a half hours and was moisturizing while worn.",B
ESTEE LAUDER,CALI CORAL,Lipstick,"a medium, coral-orange with warm, gold pearl paired with a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable color payoff that went distributed color evenly, though there was a touch of streaking along the edges due to the more emollient consistency. It had enough slip that it was easy to apply and comfortable to wear, but I could feel the color move a little more for the first two hours of wear. This lipstick stayed on well for five hours and was moisturizing.",B+
TARTE,DOWNTOWN,Eyeshadow,"muted, dark brown base with lighter silvery teal flecks of sparkle and shimmer. The texture was looser in the pan and almost felt dry, though it did not sheer out like you might think a drier eyeshadow would. It did have more fallout than other shades during application, as some of the sparkles just did not bind well with the base color. It had great color payoff, though, and lasted for seven hours on me.",B
TARTE,GENIE,Eyeshadow,"a muted, grayish teal with cool undertones and a sparkling, frosted finish. The texture was looser and felt drier with larger sparkles that did not bind as well with the base color, so there was some fallout when I worked with it (even after tapping off excess on my brush). It had good color payoff and was fairly blendable on the skin. The eyeshadow wore nicely for seven hours on me.",B-
TARTE,DARK SEAS,Eyeshadow,"a deep, navy blue with cool undertones and a metallic sheen. It was intensely pigmented with a smooth, almost cream-like texture that was slightly denser in the pan but still very blendable and easy to work with. This shade wore well for eight hours before fading on me.",A-
TARTE,AMETHYST,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark purple with warm, pink undertones and a frosted finish. It had great color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin. The consistency was soft, blendable, and a smidgen dusty so there was a bit of fallout during application. It wore well for eight hours before fading on me.",B+
TARTE,FLASK,Eyeshadow,"a bright silver with a metallic finish. There seemed to be slight bits of sparkle to the finish as well, though it was still more metallic than it was glittery. It had a smooth, blendable consistency that yielded rich, opaque color payoff. The color started to fade after seven and a half hours of wear.",B+
TARTE,GROMMET,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark black with neutral-to-warm undertones and flecks of silver sparkle over a satin finish. This was the least metallic shade in the new releases, and it had much larger, more visible sparkle instead. The texture was smoother, denser, and easier to work with, so while not all of the sparkles translated visibly on the lid, there wasn‚Äôt real fallout like with Genie or Dark Seas. This shade stayed on well for eight hours.",B+
SMASHBOX,SPACE CASE,Lipstick," a medium-dark gray with cool undertones and a very fine, gray pearl. It had good color payoff, but this shade was harder to apply evenly; I had some issues getting the edges to look even and there was some serious settling in my deeper lip lines. The texture was moderately tacky, not as spreadable as others in the line, and light-medium in weight. The natural lip color came through slightly, which had an impact on the overall tone of the end result, I think. On me, the product wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating.",B-
SMASHBOX,PETAL METAL,Lipstick,"a light, peachy bronze with warmer undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good color coverage that went on without streaking. This shade had the least glossy finish compared to other shades in the range. The consistency was smooth, lighter in weight than others in the formula, and spread without tugging on my lips. It was more prone to making my lips appear much heavier in texture with more distinct lines (it didn‚Äôt seem to fill them so much as emphasize them). It lasted for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",B
SMASHBOX,HATERADE,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark copper with warm undertones and gold, copper, and pink metallic shimmer. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single coat, which went on evenly without streaking. There was some product that pulled into my lip lines, but it was not noticeable at a normal viewing distance (only in the close-up photo). The texture was moderately tacky, smooth and spreadable, and comfortable to wear over the five hours it lasted.",A-
SMASHBOX,MOSCOW MULED,Lipstick,"a deep, reddish copper with warm undertones and gold, copper, and copper pearl. It had mostly opaque color coverage that went on evenly. The texture was smooth, light-medium in weight, moderately tacky, and easy to work with on the lips. The color wore well for almost six hours, had some color that settled in my lip lines (but the high-shine finish helped fake the appearance of smoothness), and was lightly hydrating over time.",A-
URBAN DECAY,COPYCAT,Lipgloss,"medium-dark, reddish copper with warm undertones and flecks of multi-colored glitter. It had a slightly metallic finish that was visible when applied alone, and the glitter was actally less visible than I expected. It had semi-sheer coverage that applied unevenly to the lips, and after it dried down, it did make lips look slightly drier. It lasted for four hours on its own. When I layered it over a creamier Vice Lipstick, it had a tendency to separate the underlying lipstick, so it seemed to take more trial and error to find the right layering combinations.",C
URBAN DECAY,BRUJA,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark red with warm undertones and flecks of copper, red, and pink pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied decently, though there were some areas where the color didn‚Äôt seem to adhere as well as other areas. The consistency was thin and watery, and it was difficult to spread with the included applicator. On its own, it lasted for three hours. When I tried it layered, the effect on the finish was slightly mattifying with a slight sheen.",C+
STELLAR BEAUTY,BEAM,Blush,"a medium pink with warm undertones and a satin sheen. The consistency was very soft but incredibly powdery, so there was a lot of excess powder that came away from the surface, even with a light touch, which made it messier to work with. (I‚Äôd also be slightly concerned for anyone who has much drier skin than I, in case it exacerbates flakiness.) It had semi-sheer, buildable coverage (up to semi-opaque) that applied evenly and blended out easily. It wore well for six and a half hours on me before fading.",B-
STELLAR BEAUTY,FLARE,Blush,"a medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a fair amount of gold shimmer. It had medium coverage, which was buildable to semi-opaque coverage, if desired. The powder felt silky to the touch‚Äìvery finely-milled‚Äìbut was much looser in the pan and ended up somewhat powdery. When I applied to my cheeks, it blended out nicely and ended up looking luminous but not dry or dusty. This shade wore well for seven hours before fading on me.",B-
STELLAR BEAUTY,ECLIPSE,Blush,"a muted, coppery brown with warm undertones and fine shimmer. The shimmer translated into a more luminous sheen rather than obvious shimmer particles once blended on the skin. It seemed as if the powder ‚Äúmelted‚Äù on the skin as it did not appear as dusty on my cheeks as it did swatched initially.",B-
MAC,PALE ROSE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark rosy copper with warm, brownish undertones and a pearly sheen. It had medium, buildable coverage, up to semi-opaque coverage, that applied evenly on the lips. The consistency had moderate slip, and it felt more like a hybrid between Lustre and Metallic with respect to the finish, as it had more slip than some of the other Metallic shades. It was comfortable to wear, lasted for four hours, and was lightly hydrating.",B+
MAC,DEVOTIONAL,Lipstick,"a muted, rosy brown with subtle, warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had medium, buildable pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. It wasn‚Äôt gritty, as the shimmer was rather fine, which gave it a stronger, more reflective sheen than a frosted, shimmery finish. The texture had moderate slip, which made it comfortable to wear, but it only lasted for three and a half hours. The formula felt lightly hydrating over time.",B
MAC,DIGGING FOR GOLD,Lipstick,"a medium copper with strong, warm orange undertones and finer, deeper copper pearl. It had semi-opaque color coverage that applied evenly. I appreciated how nicely the shimmer distributed, which I think might be one of the more important aspects of more metallic lipstick, as it yields a more continuous, reflective sheen. The texture was smooth, slightly creamy without being too slippery, and easy to apply and spread across the lips. The lipstick felt lightly hydrating over the four hours it lasted on me.",A-
MAC,PEARLY ONE,Lipstick,"a pale, silvery white with a glittery, metallic sheen. This shade had larger chunks of sparkle/glitter in it, which bunched up sometimes and gave lips a more textured look, but it had more medium, buildable coverage as a result. The shimmer distributed well across the lips, so it looked ‚Äúeven‚Äù despite being sheerer. I could feel the sparkle in the tube as I applied. The color wore well for three hours, though some shimmer lingered for much longer. The formula was neither drying nor hydrating overall.",B-
MAC,SILVER SPOON,Lipstick,"a muted, medium gray with silver, green, and pink pearl. It had sheer coverage that applied without tugging on the lips and had fairly even shimmer distribution. The color was workable on its own to give your natural lip color a cooler, more muted look with noticeable shimmer and sheen, but it could also work layered on other lip products. It wore well for three hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",C+
MAC,IN LUST,Lipstick,"a muted, medium orange with a hint of warm, brown undertones paired with a fine, metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied smoothly and evenly across the lips without tugging. This was one of the more pigmented shades, so it was easy to wear on its own but could still be patted on top of another lip color to add shimmer and shine. The color wore well for four hours and was lightly hydrating.",B+
OCC,PLUSH,Lipstick," a muted, medium-dark plum with warmer undertones and a cream finish. It had full color coverage in a single stroke, which applied evenly and smoothly. The texture was slightly thicker, and I think one could easily get away with less product than what is on the doe-foot applicator initially. The color wore well for over six hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
OCC,BON BON,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, rosy plum with subtle cooler undertones and warmer, gold pearl. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that covered the lips with smooth, even color. The texture was light-medium in weight, more emollient but sat well on the lips and didn‚Äôt slide around while I wore it. The color stayed on well for over six hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
OCC,SCRUB,Lipstick,"a bright, light-medium aqua with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation, and for the type of color, it applied rather well‚Äìbut it could have been a bit more even and there was slight settling into my lip lines. The consistency was light-medium in weight, moderately slippery, and spread easily across the lips. It wore well for five hours on me and was slightly drying.",B+
OCC,SYBIL,Lipstick,"a deep, dark brown with subtle, cool red undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly to the lips. The texture was thinner than other Lip Tars but still spreadable and rich in opacity. This shade was still going strong after six hours of wear and was non-drying.",A
TARTE,STUNNER,Highlighter,"a champagne gold with subtle, warm undertones and a sparkling sheen. The coverage was buildable from semi-sheer to opaque, but for totally opaque results, I would recommend applying a semi-sheer layer, allow it to set, and then go back with a little more but would just pat it over the areas you want to intensify the most and do minimal blending to avoid lifting any base products.",A-
CHANEL,FRAGOLA,Lipgloss,"muted, medium coral-red with warm undertones and a jelly-like finish. It had semi-sheer to medium coverage that went on decently, but it could have been a touch more even. The gloss felt very smooth, gel-like, and plush on the lips. This shade lasted for three hours and was hydrating over time.",B+
CHANEL,CONFUSION,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark plum with cool undertones and a jelly-like finish. It had semi-sheer coverage that went on evenly with minimal settling (just my deepest lip lines) that was not noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The consistency was smooth, gel-like, and comfortable to wear over the three hours it lasted, as it was moisturizing.",B+
CHANEL,CARACTERE,Lipgloss,"a deep berry with cool undertones and a jelly-like finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, but the color just emphasized every lip line I had as the color pooled in them and made them appear darker. The gloss itself felt smooth going on, and the color looked fairly even to my eye. This shade wore well for four and a half hours and was moisturizing.",B
URBAN DECAY,MONARCHY,Lipgloss,"a cool-toned, sparkling purple with blue and purple glitter. It had larger and finer particles, so the result was slightly metallic with visible sparkle. Alone, it looked a little rough, as the formula clung to lips as it dried down and made them appear slightly shriveled. It had semi-sheer coverage that deepened my lip color while adding shine and sparkle. This was a shade that applied best over richer, brighter, or darker shades (like fuchsia, raspberry pink, purple, black). It lasted three hours on its own and was moderately drying.",B-
URBAN DECAY,REVERB,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark, neutral-to-cool purple with silver and purple flecks of shimmer and sparkle. I found this shade harder to apply on its own, as there was enough finer shimmer to create more of medium-coverage, metallic sheen, but it did not go on evenly due to the terrible applicator‚Äìbut it dried so quickly that it was hard to apply it evenly with fingertips or a brush as well. It worked best patted over a lipstick, and this one taught me not to layer the topcoats with anything with slight to moderate slip (Urban Decay did suggest layering over a Metallized shade, which I did, and it was a total fail). It was better over something darker and more satin-to-matte in finish. On its own, it lasted for two and a half hours but was drying.",C-
URBAN DECAY,SEETHER,Lipgloss,"a rich, medium-dark coppery red with warm undertones and fine copper shimmer and flecks of gold sparkle. It had semi-opaque color coverage, but it applied unevenly and had a tendency to make my lips appear much drier (and shriveled-up) than they actually were. The color lasted for two and a half hours on its own before color lifted significantly enough that it looked quite different compared to the initial application and felt slightly drying. This one worked well over deeper lipsticks, especially ones that had more of satin finish, as it seemed to blend and smooth out better over them.",B-
MAKEUP GEEK,MAMBO,Lipstick,"a rich, raspberry pink with cooler undertones and a matte finish. It was one of the more pigmented and easier-to-apply shades with minimal streaking, just ‚Äúcracking‚Äù when I smiled where it was clear the color was pulling away at my lip lines. It had semi-opaque coverage, though it required three pulls of product just to get enough product on the lips for one layer. The consistency was thin, quick-drying, and lightly tacky after it dried down. It lasted for four hours before there was noticeable fading along the center of the lips, and it was drying after three hours of wear. (Surprisingly, it did not leave behind stain.)",C
MAKEUP GEEK,ELECTRIC SLIDE,Lipstick,"a deep, cool-toned violet purple with a matte finish. It had medium coverage, which I was not able to build well at all; every attempt led to parts of the initial layer lifting and moving. Sometimes it seemed to just erase what I had done in the first place‚Äìand I did wait for it to dry down fully! The consistency was thin, almost emollient like there was more oil in it, but it dried pretty quickly on my lips. I felt like it had already started to dry down before I could spread the product across my bottom lip more than half-way. I had to get three pulls of product to complete a single layer of coverage (not trying to build it up at all, just to lay down some color everywhere), as there seemed to be so little product on the wand. The result was patchy, uneven color that pulled into lip lines, looked ‚Äúcracked‚Äù when I smiled, and lasted four hours before there was significant fading from the center of the mouth. I tried to eat with this shade on, and I had almost no product left by the end of the meal. It was slightly drying while worn.",F
SMASHBOX,TWERK,Lipstick,"a deep, forest green with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-sheer coverage in one layer, and it was buildable to a patchy, streaky mess of ‚Äúmedium‚Äù coverage (in places). The consistency was thin and was difficult to spread across the lips, as parts of it started to dry down almost immediately and I could only cover half of my bottom lip with all the product on the wand, so I had to get three pulls of product just to do about one layer on my lips. It emphasized the texture of my lips and looked ‚Äúcracked‚Äù when I smiled, despite being thinner. It was transfer-resistant but was slightly tacky throughout the wear. This shade started to wear away from the center with three hours and was somewhat drying after four hours of wear.",F
SMASHBOX,"GIRL, PLEASE",Lipstick,"medium-dark brown with strong, warm undertones and very fine peach pearl. It had opaque color coverage in one coat, as described, and the color spread evenly across the lips without streaking. There was noticeable color in my lip lines when I looked up-close, though it was less apparent at a full view as the finish was quite shiny. This shade wore well for five and a half hours on me and was somewhat hydrating.",A
SMASHBOX,BRICK TRICK,Lipstick,"a dark, reddish burgundy with warmer undertones and a glossy finish. This shade was one of the less pigmented in the vinyl finish; it also had more slip, which made it harder to maneuver along the edges without it feathering slightly. The texture was smooth, light-medium in weight, moderately tacky, and spread without tugging. The color went on rather evenly with minimal settling, despite it seeming to have more slip. The color wore well for over six hours, but I had some feathering after a few hours (which is unusual for me).",B
SMASHBOX,BAD APPLE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. The consistency was moderately tacky, spreadable but did not slide around, and not too thick or too thin. I had some color pull into my lip lines, but the high-shine finish made it impossible to tell at a normal viewing distance. It had good pigmentation‚Äìjust shy of full coverage‚Äìin one pass. This shade wore well for six hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",A-
SMASHBOX,CRUSH IT,Lipstick,"a deep plum with subtle, cool undertones and a glossy, creamyt finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. The texture was light-medium in weight, thicker but not heavy, and felt moderately tacky to me. The product lasted for six hours on me and was lightly moisturizing.",A
NARS,LAGUNA,Bronzer,"a light-medium brown with warm, golden undertones and a matte finish. It had sheer color payoff that was buildable up to medium coverage (two to three layers). The powder was firmer in the pan, and as a result, a dense brush and a heavier touch were necessary to get enough product to transfer onto the brush to apply to my skin. While some firmer powders can be difficult to blend, I had no trouble applying and diffusing the bronzer. This shade just barely shows on me (I think it was slightly more noticeable in person), so I expect this would be ideal for those fairer than I. The bronzer started to fade after seven and a half hours of wear.",B+
STILA,SMOLDERING SATIN,Eyeshadow,"a rich bronze with warm, reddish undertones and larger, silver and brown flecks of glitter. The base color was nearly opaque, and there was a moderate amount of glitter that sat on top, so it was dazzling and wearable on its own (or as a lid color) with very slight unevenness. It dried down fast enough that I didn‚Äôt stress about keeping my eyelid taut to avoid creasing. This shade had minimal fallout over an eight-hour period.",B
STILA,SMOKY STORM,Eyeshadow,"a dark, taupe brown with strong, gold glitter and a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, so while it could be used on its own, it had the most even appearance with a little something underneath it. The consistency was thin and liquidy, but it didn‚Äôt seem too watery or prone to creasing as it dried down. It applied evenly on its own, and it had very little fallout over the eight hours it lasted.",B
STILA,VIOLET VIXEN,Eyeshadow,"a medium purple with warm, pink undertones and finer pink and purple sparkle and glitter. This shade seemed to have more depth and nuance compared to others, as there were more distinct particle sizes. It was also easier to work with, as it was smoother and had more semi-opaque to opaque coverage when applied directly to the lid using the applicator. This shade had very little fallout over an eight-hour period.",B+
STILA,MOLTEN MIDNIGHT,Eyeshadow," a medium-dark black with cooler undertones and a lot of silver and gold glitter. It had good color coverage, but it was more watery, so it sheered out somewhat and looked uneven applied on its own. I liked this one better over another product, which helped camouflage the unevenness. This one also took longer to dry down, so I had to keep my lid taut to avoid creasing as it dried down. Once it set, the glitter eyeshadow lasted for eight hours with minimal fallout.",B
NARS,FALAISES,Bronzer,"a medium-dark, reddish brown with warmer undertones and a matte finish. It had sheer, buildable coverage where three or four layers built up to mostly opaque coverage. The consistency was rather firm in the pan, so while it felt smooth swirling a fingertip against it, getting product onto a brush took more pressure and a denser brush. The powder itself was nicely blendable on the skin, and the finish was exactly in line with the brand‚Äôs promise‚Äìnatural-looking bronzer that wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúflat matte‚Äù but not shimmery either. The bronzer wore well for eight hours before fading on me.",B+
ESTEE LAUDER,INTENSE EMOTION,Lipstick,"a deep, pinky red with cool, blue undertones and a barely-there ruby red pearl. It had nearly opaque coverage‚Äìdefinitely greater than medium coverage‚Äìin a single layer, so for sheerer coverage, I‚Äôd recommend applying to the bottom lip and then pressing to blend the color onto the top lip. The consistency was smooth, creamy with just enough slip to be comfortable to apply and to wear. This shade lasted for over six hours on me, left a stain behind, and was hydrating.",A
ESTEE LAUDER,PRETTY LUCKY,Lipstick,"a bold, bright medium-dark coral-red with warm undertones and fine shimmer. It had a glossier finish compared to other shades in the range, and it was also nearly opaque in one pass. The consistency had more slip, so there were faint ‚Äúlines‚Äù visible if I pressed my lips together, though the brighter color and glossier finish made this hard to notice at a normal viewing distance. It lasted for six hours on me and was moisturizing.",B+
ESTEE LAUDER,SWEET SINNER,Lipstick,"a medium pink with warm undertones and a fine, white shimmer. It seemed to pull cooler (or pinker) when applied to the lips, though the color in the tube and swatched was definitely yellow-based. The texture was lightweight, thin without being clingy, and had enough slip not to tug but not slide around. It had semi-opaque, buildable coverage that lasted for four hours on me.",B+
NARS,SEASIDE,Bronzer,"a medium brown with warm, reddish undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was firm and dense in the pan, and I was worried it would be difficult to blend, but it was rather easy to diffuse and even out on the cheeks. I‚Äôd recommend using a denser brush with the powder, though, for even semi-sheer application. The powder had semi-sheer coverage that was buildable to medium coverage. It wore well for seven and a half hours on me before fading.",B+
NARS,LOADED,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette that features twelve eyeshadows in varying shades of warmer neutral tones. The palette will launch March 22nd at NARS and March 28th at other retailers. Some shades were nice, some shades were less impressive, but the majority of them would benefit greatly from an eyeshadow primer‚Äìboth for longer wear as well as greater color payoff.",B
CLE DE PEAU,PERSIMMON,Blush,"medium coral-orange with warm undertones and a satin finish. I felt like it looked more coral the more I blended out, whereas initially it appeared more orange-toned. It had sheer to medium, buildable coverage that applied evenly to the skin. The texture was smooth, thin, lightweight, and just a bit emollient initially but felt more like a powder once it hit my skin. The color wore well for eight hours on me.",A-
CLE DE PEAU,PERFECT PEACH,Blush,"a muted, medium rosy brown with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had sheer pigmentation that was buildable to medium coverage with two to three layers. The blush felt creamy in the pot, but it immediately turned into more of a powder-like product on the skin. It was easy to blend out along the edges, and it wore nicely for seven hours on me.",B+
CHANEL,MELTED HONEY,Lipgloss,"a light gold with light gold and medium gold pearl. The base color of the gloss had semi-sheer coverage that lightened and warmed up my natural lip color. For such a light shade, it actually applied rather evenly and had just a smidgen of settling on my lower lip. The texture was smooth, comfortable to wear, and hydrating with just a touch of tackiness. It lasted for three hours on me.",B+
CHANEL,NOCE MOSCATA,Lipgloss,"a medium, very warm-toned pink with fine beige and gold pearl. It had medium coverage that went on evenly and had minimal color that settled into lip lines. It seemed particularly hard to notice from a normal viewing distance as the color was closer to my natural lip color. The consistency felt smooth, just a touch sticky but not heavy or thick. This shade wore well for three hours and was moisturizing.",B+
CHANEL,CARESSE,Lipgloss,"a medium brown with warm, yellowish undertones and a cream finish. This was one of the few shades I tried that had no shimmer. The consistency was smoother but less gel-like‚Äìit didn‚Äôt have quite the same cushion-like feel of other shades. It had nearly opaque coverage, but there was noticeable color that had gathered in my lip lines. The gloss wore nicely for four hours and was hydrating.",B+
STILA,DIAMOND DUST,Eyeshadow,"a platinum silver with lots and lots of silver and gold glitter. This one had less of a base ‚Äúcolor‚Äù and was just chocked full of glitter with a more watery base. I liked this one best patted over another eyeshadow or over/under eyeliner, as it added sparkle but could look more uneven without something under it. The more watery consistency made it take slightly longer to dry down, and so I had to be careful to keep my eyelid shut to avoid creasing. Once it dried down, it lasted well for eight hours with slight fallout but impressively little for a glitter eyeshadow.",B
STILA,GOLD GODDESS,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium gold with warm, yellow undertones with a clear base and lots of gold glitter. This one had a tendency to apply more medium to semi-opaque, depending on what was on the applicator (it was different every time I used it). It took a bit longer to dry, so it would seep into the fine lines underneath my eyes (if I used it as a liner) or crease it was drying down if I didn‚Äôt keep my eyelid taut during the drying time (about 30 seconds). The effect of it, once dry, is sparkling, and there was minimal fallout/migration when worn.",B-
STILA,KITTEN KARMA,Eyeshadow,"a medium, rosy gold metallic base with lighter flecks of silver and copper glitter. This one had a real base to it, so it had more coverage that didn‚Äôt get diluted when it was applied to the lid like the first two in this review. It had more semi-opaque coverage, along with plenty of glitter, and it applied fairly evenly and well on its own, though I still preferred to use it over another eyeshadow. It wasn‚Äôt too watery, and it dried down fast enough where I didn‚Äôt feel like I had to worry about creasing. It wore well for eight hours with minimal fallout.",B
STILA,ROSE GOLD RETRO,Eyeshadow,"a rich, medium-dark copper with warm, reddish undertones and a glittering, metallic sheen. This was one of the best performing shades in the formula that I‚Äôve tried, as it was richly pigmented with opaque coverage and noticeable glitter. It wasn‚Äôt quite as glittery or as sparkly as other shades, but the balance of base and glitter seemed to make it more impactful on its own and easier to use. It lasted for eight hours with very minimal fallout.",A-
LANCOME,GOLD LIGHTS,Highlighter,"light-medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a pearly sheen. It had sheer to semi-sheer coverage that applied without issue to the skin, though I felt like it was easiest and fastest to work with fingertips for blending over a brush. The consistency was thin, a little mousse-y, and dried down so the wear was longer (seven and a half hours) but gave me enough time to work with it first.",B+
LANCOME,ROSEGOLD LIGHTS,Highlighter,"a medium-dark, golden copper with warm, reddish undertones and a luminous sheen. It had semi-sheer to medium, buildable color payoff that applied evenly and smoothly to the skin. I had no trouble blending this shade out, and I felt that brushes and fingertips worked equally well here. The texture was lightweight, thin but had some substance, and distributed well across the skin. It lasted for eight hours on me before fading.",A-
CLE DE PEAU,CRANBERRY,Blush,"a medium-dark, rosy plum with warm undertones and a satin finish. The more blended out the color, the less shimmery it appeared on the skin‚Äìmore like a natural sheen than overtly shimmery. The consistency was thin with enough slip to blend easily but it dried down quickly and set in place for a solid eight hours on me. It had semi-sheer coverage that was buildable to semi-opaque coverage.",A-
CLE DE PEAU,PALE FIG,Blush,"a medium-dark pink with warmer undertones and a satin finish. It had sheer coverage that was buildable to semi-opaque coverage, if desired. The consistency felt smooth, blendable, and thinner with just enough slip that it still felt like a cream product, but it was never greasy, slick, or wet on the skin‚Äìit immediately started to look and feel like a powder blush upon contact with my skin. The color wore well for almost nine hours on me before fading.",A
SMASHBOX,CRIMSON CHROME,Lipstick,"a bright, medium ruby red with fine, red pearl. The pearl was similar in tone compared to the base color, which gave it a stronger metallic sheen‚Äìit looked more foil-like than other shades. The consistency was smooth, not too thick or heavy but more substantial on the lips than your average gloss, with some tackiness. It was intensely pigmented with a bit of color that sat in my lip lines, though I did not notice that at a normal viewing distance. The color stayed on well for over six hours and was slightly hydrating.",A
SMASHBOX,BRAINS 'N' BRONZE,Lipstick,"a rich, reddish brown with warm undertones and copper and gold pearl that give it a more metallic finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in one layer with a smooth, light-medium weight texture. There was moderate tackiness that developed further tackiness over the five and a half hours it lasted. The formula of this shade had more slip than others, so it appeared both wet and glossy applied and had more color that settled in my lip lines. It was lightly hydrating.",B+
SMASHBOX,MAUVE SQUAD,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark rose gold with warm, brown undertones and fine, pink and gold pearl. It had medium coverage in one layer, which was somewhat buildable, but the formula has a thicker feel on the lips that applying much more did seem like overdoing it and made it more prone to sliding around/feeling heavy. The color applied evenly, though there was a bit of color that sat in my lip lines (which, again, wasn‚Äôt quite as noticeable at a normal viewing distance as the finish was so shiny). This was one of the shorter wearing shades at four and a half hours.",B
SMASHBOX,FOILED BRAT,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark berry with subtle, cool undertones and plum, violet, and red pearl. It had almost opaque coverage in a single layer with even application. The texture was smooth with moderate tackiness, and there was some color that welled in my lip lines from the start, though it did not worsen and wasn‚Äôt apparent at a normal viewing distance with the high-shine finish. It lasted for six hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",A-
CLE DE PEAU,101 GROUNDED,Palette,"a medium-dark brown and golden peach. The formula is supposed to have a ‚Äúsilky‚Äù feel, be moisturizing on the lids (though it is a powder formula), long-wearing, and have true-to-pan color. I like the effect of Cle de Peau‚Äôs eyeshadows on the lid; I think that ‚Äúmoisturizing‚Äù aspect of them makes them sit well on the lid as time passes, where they meld well to bare skin. I find that they can be semi-opaque to opaque, more buildable and very easy to wear as a wash of color, if desired. The eyeshadows are rose-scented, though I only just noticed the scent with the compact open but not applied.",A-
CHANEL,BOURGEOISIE,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark, rosy mauve with neutral-to-cool undertones and a moderate amount of light pink sparkle. It had semi-sheer pigmentation that went on somewhat unevenly. I felt like it was easy to get ‚Äúlines‚Äù any time I pressed my lips together as the gloss had a creamier, more slippery feel on the lips compared to some shades. I could feel some of the shimmer/sparkle on the lips but only occasionally. The color lasted for three and a half hours and was hydrating on me.",B
CHANEL,BURNT SUGAR,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark, reddish plum with warm undertones and fine, gold and copper pearl. It had medium, somewhat buildable coverage that spread easily across the lips, but it did not appear as even as I would have liked. The shine was great, and the feel of the gloss was comfortable and hydrating as long as I wore it. This shade wore well for four hours on me.",B+
CHANEL,ROSE PULPE,Lipgloss,"a light-medium pink with cooler undertones and a smattering of lighter pink sparkle. It had semi-sheer coverage‚Äìit muted my lip freckle and turned my lips much pinker. The consistency was smooth, gel-like, and comfortable to wear as it had little tackiness and was hydrating. There was a smidgen of color that gathered in my lip lines, but the mirror-like shine made it less apparent from a normal viewing distance. This shade lasted for two and a half hours on me.",B
SMASHBOX,GOLD,Palette,"three powder highlighters that are golden in tone/hue. Smashbox describes the palette as having three finishes‚Äìsubtle glow, moderate, and super sparkle‚Äìand that the texture is ‚Äúultra-blendable, velvety smooth.‚Äù The first two shades are better in quality, while the last shade had a firmer, drier texture and was more sparkle than powder. Whether one prefers or steers clear of sparkle is one matter, but this type of sparkle did not apply well to the skin, as it was looser and did not spread evenly.",C+
CHANEL,JARDINS ECLATANTS,Palette,"a warm-toned, neutral palette that featured a pink-peach, peach, warm brown, and deep, coppery brown. It‚Äôs a new, limited edition palette for spring/summer that uses Chanel‚Äôs ‚Äúvibrant, pigment-rich formula‚Äù that is ‚Äúlong-lasting‚Äù and has a ‚Äúsoft, smooth texture.‚Äù The colors are definitely dupable, so I see this working best for someone who prefers Chanel‚Äôs formula, is looking for an all-in-one quad, or uses these types of shades often. The palette had semi-opaque to opaque pigmentation, seven to eight hour wear, and was very easy to apply and blend out.",A-
NARS,BAIT,Lipgloss,"a bright, cotton candy pink with cool, blue undertones and a glossy, cream finish. It had mostly opaque pigmentation that went on fairly evenly. There were very slight ‚Äúlines‚Äù that were visible if my lips pressed together as well as from when I moved the applicator along the edges of my lips. The consistency was smooth, gel-like but not too dense, and comfortable to wear. It lasted for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",B+
NARS,DISRUPTOR,Lipgloss,"a bright, meidum red with neutral-to-cool undertones and a glossy, cream finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage that went on evenly, though there was enough slip in the formula that a bit of color gathered in my lip lines. The brightness and shininess of the product made that less apparent, so I didn‚Äôt notice it at a normal viewing distance. The formula was comfortable to wear, lightly hydratnig, and lasted for six hours.",A
NARS,IMPOSSIBLE RED,Lipgloss,"a vibrant, coral-red with subtle, warm undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied evenly across the lips. The consistency was smooth, almost gel-like (a little ‚Äúwet‚Äù in feel but thicker) and was easy to spread and maneuver along my lips. It wore well for almost six hours, though it looked more like a satin finish after three and a half hours. The formula was lightly hydrating.",A
NARS,SUCK,Lipgloss,"a light-medium, peachy coral with warm undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. It had great pigmentation that went on evenly, though there was a bit of color that gathered in my lip lines (which became more noticeable after an hour of wear)‚Äìnot at all bad given the type of formula and shade, though. The texture was smooth with moderate slip, which tempered to a more satin-like finish and feel after two hours of wear. This shade lasted for four and a half hours and was hydrating.",B+
TOO FACED,BLINDED BY THE LIGHT,Highlighter,"a very light beige with warm undertones and a sparkling, pearly finish. I could just barely detect a subtle sheen on the skin when I applied this, as it was quite sheer and did not build as I tried to layer it‚Äìit just seemed to add bits of sparkle that did not stay well on the skin (lots of migration over time). The texture was smooth, firm but did not seem like it was going to be problematic, and it definitely didn‚Äôt emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture! What I could see of the highlighter seemed to last for seven hours no me.",D-
TOO FACED,RAY OF LIGHT,Highlighter,"a light-medium peach with warm, orange undertones and a soft, sparkling sheen. This shade had medium, somewhat buildable coverage, but the shimmer did not bind as well with the base powder, so I felt like the more I blended out the product on my cheeks, the less apparent the sheen was. The powder felt smooth across the surface, but it was firmer and denser overall; I preferred using a blush brush (greater density, on average) compared to a tapered highlighting brush for application. It wore well for seven and a half hours on me.",B-
TOO FACED,YOU LIGHT UP MY LIFE,Highlighter,"a medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a soft, pearly sheen. This shade was the most pigmented and had the strongest sheen out of three released. The texture seemed softer and while still dense, more forgiving and easier to get product onto my brush. It was easy to blend out on the skin, though it seemed to have more shimmer than sheen, and more shimmer than real color to it, so it ended up being less intense in practice than it appeared in the pan. It started to fade after seven and a half hours of wear.",B+
COVER FX,ROSE GOLD,Highlighter,"medium-dark golden copper with warm, reddish undertones and a metallic sheen. The finish was more metallic on this shade compared to the other two recently added shades but more in line with the original, core set of shades.",A+
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,DEW YOU,Highlighter,"a medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a pearly sheen. The shimmer was fine enough that it didn‚Äôt read metallic when sheered out, but it was buildable enough that it could be nearly metallic when layered on the skin. Overall, the pigmentation was semi-sheer to semi-opaque, depending on application method, but to get higher coverage, it would be best to apply one layer, allow that to dry, and then pat on additional product.",A+
URBAN DECAY,LUMINOUS,Highlighter,"a translucent, pearly white with fine white and pale gold pearl. The brand considers this to be a more ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù shade, but the translucent base seemed to make it one of the most subtle shades in the range as well. This one literally seemed to be ‚Äúmy skin but better,‚Äù assuming that one associates a natural ‚Äúdewiness‚Äù to the skin as being better. When I layered it over a blush or bronzer, it had more noticeable luminosity. The consistency was thin, fluid and a little watery, and it blended out nicely over bare skin. It had sheer to semi-sheer coverage that lasted for eight hours on me.",A-
URBAN DECAY,SIN,Highlighter,"a light-medium gold with very fine gold pearl. On lighter and cooler complexions, this might also add some warmth, but on my skin tone, it was mostly a subtle, golden sheen as the base was quite sheer. I felt like this shade had more distinctive shimmer‚Äìit wasn‚Äôt quite as fine or as subtle applied‚Äìcompared to the rest of the shades, though it was nowhere near intense, so it still seemed true to the description of the formula. The highlighter had a thin, smooth, and blendable texture that sat well on the skin and distributed evenly when I patted it onto my cheek bones. It wore well for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
MAKEUP REVOLUTION,EVER GLOW LIGHTS,Highlighter,"a soft white with subtle, warm undertones and a soft sheen. This was one of the more subtle shades with respect to finish, and this was much more in line with the concept of ‚Äúnatural illumination.‚Äù The texture was soft, a little dusty but did not appear dry on the cheeks, and was blendable. It had good pigmentation‚Äìless buildable than just pigmented‚Äìbut that dustiness made it sheer out a bit on the skin, so it was easy to control and sheer out the coverage, if desired. It wore well for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
MAKEUP REVOLUTION,HOLOGRAPHIC LIGHTS,Highlighter,"a bright white with a gold-to-green shifting frost. The finish was much more metallic (not at all ‚Äúnatural‚Äù), though it was just shy of emphasizing my skin‚Äôs natural texture to my eye. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation paired with a blendable, somewhat drier texture (it seemed dusty in the pan but not on the skin). The shift was noticeable as I turned my head, and it also worked well to change up various blushes/bronzers layered underneath. The highlighter started to fade after seven and a half hours of wear.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,GOLD,Lipgloss,"a bright, true gold with warm, yellow undertones and flecks of gold shimmer and sparkle. This was actually one of the less pigmented shades in the range, and this was also the exact same in texture and color as the holiday release (the box was even gold-hued like the holiday edition). It had semi-opaque pigmentation, but the gloss didn‚Äôt apply evenly so there were some areas that had less visible shimmer. This particular shade also seemed to be chocked full of shimmer/sparkle rather than a more pigmented base (the others seemed to actually tint/provide coverage beyond the shimmer). It wore well for five hours on me and was hydrating.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,CHAMPAGNE PEARL,Lipgloss,"a light-medium golden copper with warm, orange undertones and multi-colored pearl, which was dominated by gold, rose gold, and copper pearl. The gloss applied evenly and smoothly across the lips, and I felt like the shimmer spread well, too. It had good color coverage, though not quite opaque, that sat well on my lips. It was hydrating and lasted for four and a half hours on me.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,PINK PEARL,Lipgloss,"a light-medium pink with a warmer undertone but cooler pink sparkle and shimmer. This was the sheerest of the seven shades in the line-up with semi-sheer coverage, though it applied fairly evenly so it was still wearable on its own. I think it also had the least impact when layered over other shades, as it did not have nearly as much shimmer or coverage to begin with. It wore well for four hours and was lightly hydrating.",C+
BITE BEAUTY,ROSE PEARL,Lipgloss,"a dark plum with strong, warm brown undertones and flecks of plum, copper, and dark pink pearl. It had medium, somewhat buildable coverage (up to semi-opaque) with a smooth, lightly tacky texture that was comfortable to wear. It applied evenly across the lips and lasted for four and a half hours on me.",B+
MAKEUP REVOLUTION,MOON GLOW LIGHTS,Highlighter,"a soft, pale pink with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. Of the four shades available in the range, this shade had the most natural of finishes. It could easily be used on its own, layered with any blush or bronzer, or even used to tamp down an over-the-top highlighter without dulling it. The consistency was soft, somewhat dusty and dry to the touch, but it applied well to bare skin and did not look dry on. It had medium, buildable coverage, as described, and lasted for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
MAKEUP REVOLUTION,GOLD ADDICT,Highlighter,"a muted, medium-dark gold with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. This shade did not seem as shimmery initially, but the more I blended and buffed the powder onto my skin, the more metallic and glowing the finish looked. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was builable to opaque coverage with two to three layers. The powder felt a little looser and dustier in the pan, but it blended out nicely and sat well on the skin. It wore for just over seven hours on me before fading noticeably.",B
NYX,STATE OF FLUX,Highlighter,"an icy, light pink with cool undertones and a sparkling sheen. The finish had larger sparkles in it and less fine ones compared to most shades in the range, so if you aren‚Äôt a fan of sparkle, this might be one to skip. It had sheer to medium coverage (hard to get it to be opaque without piling on four to five layers of product, at which point, the product is too thick and flakes off). The consistency was blendable, lightweight, and thin with a more watery, cooler feel on the skin. It dried down and lasted for seven hours on me.",B
NARS,BANC DE SABLE,Highlighter,"three highlighters that go from light to light-medium to medium in depth with all three being warmer in tone and fairly shimmery. They‚Äôre not listed as part of the Dual Intensity formula, though they felt a lot like it (firmer but not stiff, a little dry to the touch but very blendable and don‚Äôt appear dry or dusty on the skin), and the description of the formula was similar‚Äìuse dry for ‚Äúshimmering veil of second-skin color‚Äù or wet for a ‚Äúhigh-impact glow.‚Äù All three shades were quite shimmery applied dry, and they were metallic when applied with a damp brush. I‚Äôd disagree with these being ‚Äúsheer shimmer‚Äù or ‚Äúsecond-skin color‚Äù in any way dry‚Äìall three were mostly opaque to opaque dry, which is where the palette fell ‚Äúshort.‚Äù",B+
COLOUR POP,CANNOLI,Highlighter,"ColourPop Cannoli Highlighter Trio ($22.00 for 0.45 oz.) includes three highlighters‚Äìtwo are totally new, one is a repromote‚Äìhoused in a paper sleeve but each is individually packaged (just like any of the standalone highlighters). You can also purchase any of the included shades individually for $8 a pop. I‚Äôm a big fan of ColourPop‚Äôs highlighters, as they are particularly long-wearing and very blendable on the skin. If you‚Äôre a fan of warmer golds, you‚Äôll probably enjoy this set of highlighters.",A
NARS,BETTINA,Lipstick,"soft, medium-dark rosy mauve with subtle, warm undertones and a pearl ‚Äúmatte‚Äù finish. It had the flat, shine-free look of a true matte finish but definitely had shimmer. It had medium coverage, which was somewhat buildable, that applied without tugging or dragging on the lips. The texture felt thinner and a bit clingy on my lips, and I found the formula somewhat drying over the four hours it lasted.",B
NARS,INTRIGUING,Lipstick,"a dark pink with warm undertones and a satin finish. There was very fine pearl that was almost undetectable at a normal viewing distance. It had semi-opaque color payoff that applied evenly and went on smoothly without tugging on my lips as the texture was velvety. It did feel clingier and was a thinner formula, which helped it wear longer‚Äìfive hours‚Äìbut was just a touch drying overall.",A-
NARS,WALKYRIE,Lipstick,"a dark, reddish plum with strong, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. The pencil felt smooth, velvety, and did not drag on the lips as it went on, even though it had a shine-free finish. It wore well for almost six hours on me and was non-drying.",A
MAKEUP GEEK,TELEPATHIC,Eyeshadow,"a light white gold with warmer undertones and a metallic sheen. The finish became more reflective and less frosted when I used it damp, but the coverage level was the same‚Äìopaque‚Äìregardless of dry or damp application. The texture was smooth, finely-milled but not dusty, and it applied evenly on the lid without primer. The color started to crease after eight hours of wear.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,GARGOYLE,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark olive green with warm, brownish undertones and a frosted finish. It was richly pigmented whether I used it dry or with a damp brush, though it had a stronger sheen when applied damp overall. The texture was easy to work with‚Äìsoft but not so finely-milled that it was dusty or prone to fallout‚Äìand applied evenly on the skin. It stayed on for eight hours before creasing.",A
MAKEUP GEEK,ILLUSION,Eyeshadow,"a light pink with cooler undertones paired with warmer, golden shimmer. It looked cooler and warmer on me depending on what I paired with it; the icier base came through alongside other, cooler, icier colors. It had a soft, blendable texture, though it was a little ‚Äúchunkier‚Äù compared to other pigments in the range, so I had better luck patting and pressing it against the lid or using it with a dampened brush for the easiest application. I noticed creasing after eight hours of wear.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,FIREFLY,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, golden copper with warm, reddish undertones and a metallic sheen. It had medium, buildable color payoff applied dry, and it was intensely shiny and opaque when applied with a damp brush. The consistency was soft, finely-milled without being dusty or powdery, and it was easy to blend out on the lid. It wore well for eight hours on me.",B+
BENEFIT,DANDELION TWINKLE,Highlighter,"a light peach with warm, orange undertones and a luminous sheen. The shimmer used in the powder was rather fine, so it did not look shimmery nor did the powder emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture when blended out.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,ACOUSTIC,Lipgloss,"a dark burgundy with warm undertones and red and magenta pearl. It had good pigmentation‚Äìnot quite opaque‚Äìin a single layer. The texture was slightly thinner than most shades in the range, but still more substantial than most modern gloss formulas these days. It had more slip and appeared glossier but had less noticeable pearl, so it almost seemed to have less shine when compared to some of the other shades as well. The evenness of the application helped to camouflage some of the color that settled into my lip lines. It wore well for six hours and felt hydrating.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,REPLAY,Lipgloss,"a bright, pinky-red with subtle, cool undertones and very fine red pearl. This was the least ‚ÄúFoiled‚Äù of the range‚Äìit was more of a subdued sheen compared to the high-shine finish on other shades. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, and the gloss felt a little thinner overall. This shade wore well for six hours and was lightly hydrating.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,VINYL,Lipgloss,"a deep taupe with warm, brownish undertones and green and gold pearl (and seemingly other colors, too, but predominantly green and gold). The consistency was light-medium in weight, moderately tacky, and comfortable to wear. The color could have went on more evenly, and I did have a bit of gloss show up in my lip lines. It had semi-opaque, buildable color payoff that lasted for five and a half hours on me.",B
NYX,LIQUID PRISM,Highlighter,"a pale, whitish beige with iridescent pink to violet pearl. This shade was more like a duochrome, though the shift was subtle. The texture was lightweight, watery and thin but spreadable across the skin. It had sheer to medium coverage, which was buildable by applying a second layer after the first one had dried. Another way to build up coverage was to pat the color on, wait until almost dry, and then blend out the edges to maintain that initial opacity. It wore well for seven and a half hours on me.",B
MAKEUP GEEK,VIP,Lipgloss,"a dark peach with warm undertones and fine gold pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which distributed fairly evenly, though this shade settled more noticeably into lip lines compared to other shades (it was also the lightest shade in the range). The consistency was smooth, spreadable, and comfortable to wear. It wore well for five hours on me and felt lightly moisturizing.",B
MAKEUP GEEK,HEADLINER,Lipgloss,"a rich, deep bronze with warm, copper undertones and gold, red, and copper pearl. It had mostly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which will work for someone who likes more pigmented glosses, but it was hard to get a ‚Äútranslucent pop of color‚Äù with this shade. The texture was smooth, moderately tacky, and thick enough that held on and covered well but was not goopy. The color wore well for six hours on me and felt lightly hydrating.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,SET LIST,Lipgloss,"a rich, medium-dark plum with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good color payoff that applied evenly across the lips. The gloss felt thick but not goopy, had moderate tackiness, and spread evenly across the lips. There was a smidgen of gloss that sat in my deepest lip line but wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance due to high-shine finish. On me, the gloss wore well for six hours and seemed slightly moisturizing.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,#026,Lipstick,"a brighter, medium-dark rosy plum with cooler undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage that applied with minimal tugging. The pencil felt soft enough to line with lips comfortably, but it took a little more work to blend and even out the color once applied (it was easiest to do so by pressing and gently rubbing my lips together). This shade stayed on well for almost six hours and was a touch drying after four hours.
Bite Beauty recommends wearing this particular shade with Fig; I think it would work well with Cotton Candy (brighter, cooler), Kimchi (darker, brighter), or Gin Fizz (cooler) ‚Äî see comparison swatches.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,#028,Lipstick,"a medium-dark plum with warm undertones and a satin finish. The consistency was a touch creamy, so it applied easily along the edges of the lips and only dragged minimally when filling in my lips entirely. It had semi-opaque color payoff that went on fairly evenly on its own, though I had to spread and even out the color with my lips afterward. The color lasted well for five and a half hours on me and was non-drying. Bite Beauty recommends wearing this particular shade with Verbena or Honeycomb; I think it would work well with Chai (warmer), Verbena (warmer), Rhubarb (cooler), or Pepper (more muted) ‚Äî see comparison swatches.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,#030,Lipstick,"a soft, medium rosy plum with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly and smoothly to the lips. The consistency was soft, thin, and a little tacky but non-drying over the five hours it lasted. It applied evenly for the most part on its own. Bite Beauty recommends wearing this particular shade with Verbena or Pepper; I think it would work well with Rhubarb (darker), Pepper (warmer), Fig (lighter), or Sorbet (lighter) ‚Äî see comparison swatches.",B+
COLOUR POP,WAFFLE,Highlighter,"three highlighters‚Äìtwo are totally new, one is a repromote‚Äìhoused in a paper sleeve but each is individually packaged (just like any of the standalone highlighters). You can also purchase any of the included shades individually for $8 a pop. I‚Äôm a big fan of ColourPop‚Äôs highlighters, as they are particularly long-wearing and very blendable on the skin.",A
MAC,IN THE FLESH,Palette,"fifteen eyeshadows in a variety of finishes with a neutral-themed color combination. The first row seemed warmer, while the middle row was more pink-based, and the bottom row was smoky. A lot of the pre-made 15-pan palettes have been better (on average) compared to MAC‚Äôs quads, but this one was more of a miss.",C+
NARS,413 BLKR,Lipstick,"bright, medium fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a fine, lavender pearl. It had mostly opaque color coverage that applied evenly across the lips. The lip pencil felt smooth, velvety, and glided on without dragging on the lips. This shade wore well for six hours and was lightly drying after five hours of wear. There was a faint fuchsia stain left behind.",A
NARS,LET'S GO CRAZY,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark fuchsia pink with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had good color coverage, though it took a second layer to get full coverage. The texture was thin, lightweight, but velvety and smooth, so it did not feel clingy or uncomfortable to wear. This shade wore well for six hours and was neither drying nor hydrating, and it also left a subtle stain behind.",A
NARS,RED SQUARE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange with warm, red undertones and a matte finish. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, velvety consistency that was almost creamy compared to most shades, though I would not say it felt wet or emollient. The lip color glided on and did not tug or drag on my lips. The color stayed on nicely for over six hours and was slightly drying toward the end.",A
NYX,GOLD RUSH,Highlighter,"a muted, medium-dark coppery bronze with warm undertones and flecks of gold pearl and sparkle. This shade was one of the most shimmery (and deepest in visible color) within the range. It worked more as a highlighting bronzer on my skin tone, and I suspect it would be a beautiful highlighter on medium and darker complexions. It had semi-sheer to opaque, buildable pigmentation. The texture was thin, watery, and cool to the touch, but it spread evenly across the skin and blended well. It dried down and yielded a soft, glowing finish with a few bits of sparkle. It wore nicely for eight hours on me.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,MIXTAPE,Lipgloss,"a dark burgundy-brown with warm undertones and multi-colored pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in one layer, which would be opaque in two layers. The consistency was thicker but not heavy, and a second layer did not feel goopy or turn the color into a high-maintenance texture. It wore well for six hours on me and was lightly hydrating. There was a touch of color that sat in my lip lines, though.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,DRUMROLL,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark magenta purple with cooler, violet and fuchsia pearl. It had medium, buildable color coverage that went on fairly evenly and did not appear streaky. The texture was comfortable to wear, though it was a little thicker and had noticeable tackiness, and there was a touch of gloss that sat in my deeper lip lines. This shade lasted for seven hours on me.",A-
MAC,BI-CEPTUAL,Lipstick,"a light-medium peachy beige with warm undertones and a natural finish. It had semi-sheer color coverage that went on evenly and, despite its lightness in color, did not pull into my lip lines much! It was a Lustre finish, so the coverage level was expected to be sheerer. The texture was lightweight, thin but not clingy, and had enough slip not to drag when I applied it from the tube. It wore well for two hours and was non-drying.",B
MAC,MASCU-LINITY,Lipstick,"a muted, medium beige-brown with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque, buildable color coverage that went on evenly but had a tendency to sit in my lip lines a bit. It had a Lustre finish, so the coverage level was expected to be sheerer. The consistency was thin but not clingy, and while it wasn‚Äôt hydrating, it didn‚Äôt dry my lips out either. This shade stayed on for about two hours.",B-
MAC,TESTOSTERONE,Lipstick,"a medium pink-coral with a touch of fine, gold pearl. It had semi-sheer, buildable color coverage (to about semi-opaque) with a thin, lightly emollient consistency that went on evenly and did not drag on the lips. It had a Lustre finish, so the coverage level was expected to be sheerer.. The wear time was almost three hours, which was longer than the standard Lustre for me, and it was non-drying.",B
MAC,FLEX APPEAL,Lipgloss,"a muted, berry-tinted translucent base with barely-there pearl. It gave my lips a slightly darker, pinker look but did not add a lot of color or coverage. It had sheer coverage, which wasn‚Äôt buildable, that lasted for two hours. The consistency was smooth, jelly-like, and comfortable to wear. The formula was hydrating over time.",C+
MAC,LOVE YOUR BODY,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium pinky-coral tinted translucent base with a touch of pearl. It made my lips appear warmer, brighter, and glossier without dramatically altering the color. It looked more like a tinted gloss than something with actual coverage. The consistency was jelly-like, comfortable to wear, and had a lot of shine while being hydrating. This shade lasted for two and a half hours on me.",C+
MAC,NICE CHEEKS,Lipgloss,"a brownish-tinted translucent base with no pearl. It seemed to add some warmth and deepen my natural lip color just slightly, but it was one of the sheerer and least impactful shades in the launch. The consistency was jelly-like and easy to spread across the lips. It was hydrating over the two hours it lasted.",C
MAC,OH MY LUNGE,Lipgloss,"a very light pink with warm undertones. It had sheer coverage‚Äìand this shade was actually listed as sheer by the brand‚Äìthat bordered on transparent as there was so little visible tint. I felt like the only difference was my lips look wet and as a result, a little ‚Äúdarker‚Äù compared to being totally bare. The texture was comfortable to wear, jelly-like but not too thick, and non-sticky. This shade lasted two and a half hours and was moisturizing.",B
MAC,RIPPED,Lipgloss,"a raspberry pink with cool undertones and barely-there pearl. This was one of the more ‚Äúpigmented‚Äù shades in the range, though it still looked like tinted gloss rather than regular gloss or lipstick. It deepened and drew out the pink in my lip color while hydrating my lips. It had a smooth, balm-like feel that had a high-shine finish. This shade wore well for three hours on me.",B-
MAC,SIXXX PACK,Lipgloss,"a bright, light-medium pink with cool, blue undertones and barely-there pearl. It had very sheer coverage that brought out the natural pink tones in my lips but did not really add coverage or color. It looked more like a glossy stain, but it didn‚Äôt actually stain as it only lasted for two hours on me. The gloss was non-sticky, jelly-like but not thick, and hydrating while worn.",C
MAKEUP GEEK,ABRACADABRA,Eyeshadow,"a light, springy green with soft, warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had more medium, buildable coverage than rich coverage right away, but the product seemed denser, even though it still felt soft and finely-milled by touch. It applied with slightly more coverage and had a more metallic sheen when I used a dampened brush compared to dry application. This shade wore well for eight hours on me before creasing.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,TIN MAN,Eyeshadow,"a silvery gray with a purplish sheen‚ÄìI felt like there was a lot of nuance to this shade. The texture was soft, blendable, and easy to work with both dry and damp. It had more semi-opaque, buildable coverage when I used it dry compared to its opaque coverage when I used a dampened brush. It started to crease after eight hours on me.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,ATLANTIS,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium sky blue with cool undertones and a metallic sheen. This was one of the more Foiled shades in the range‚Äìvery reflective and high-shine. The consistency seemed a little chunkier in the pot, but it applied quite smoothly to bare skin, though I found that using a dampened brush was key with this particular shade, as it produced opaque, even coverage. The dry application was almost grayer and less blue with medium coverage. The eyeshadow started to crease after eight hours of wear.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,VOODOO,Eyeshadow,"a rich, bright grass green with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic finish. It was intensely pigmented, but it was trickier to work with as the texture was chunkier, almost gritty, and really had to buffed and pressed into the skin. I recommend taking a little bit of the pigment on a clean palette or the interior of the lid with a wet brush (not just damp) to mix and bind everything together and then applying to the lid. The color stayed on well for eight hours.",B
MAC,SOLAR GLOW TIMES NINE,Palette,"nine, dime-sized eyeshadows. I‚Äôd characterize this palette by its finish‚Äìglittery‚Äìand as a result, it is difficult to use on its own (I‚Äôd recommend a glitter adhesive as a base), sheerer (which is by design when it comes to the Lustre finish but not so much for the other finishes), and short-wearing.",C-
NARS,TRAIN BLEU,Lipstick,"deep, purpled berry with cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage that went on fairly evenly and smoothly. The consistency was velvety, smooth without being emollient, and glided on easily. The lip color could have sat a bit better on lips, but it lasted for six hours and was just a touch drying overall.",A-
NARS,UNSPOKEN,Lipstick,"a muted, purplish navy blue with cool undertones and a satin finish. It was a more unusual shade for NARS, but unfortunately, it did not apply as evenly as I would have liked. I think this shade would work better with a liner underneath or it perhaps a lip primer. The texture felt smooth going on and felt fairly comfortable to wear (it was a bit drying after a few hours). It wore well for five hours on me.",B+
COLOUR POP,GAME CHANGER,Eyeshadow,"a light, golden green with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. It had intense color payoff with a smooth, blendable texture that was a little looser in the pan, and it was easy to get too much product on the brush, so I‚Äôd recommend using a lighter touch and going easy initially! The color wore for just over eight hours on me.",A-
COLOUR POP,CHECKMATE,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium, springy green with warm, yellowish undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had medium, buildable color coverage (to semi-opaque without a primer) paired with a slightly dusty, thinner texture that was prone to sheering out (hence the inability to build it to opaque coverage on its own). This shade lasted for six and a half hours on me before fading.",C
COLOUR POP,UP AND UP,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium green with cooler undertones and a warmer, golden sheen. It was like a mint green and a grass green were layered together for something that seemed warmer than cooler, but it had a lot of depth. The color payoff was opaque, while the eyeshadow felt smooth and soft to the touch. It blended out well and wore for eight hours before fading.",A-
COLOUR POP,SIDELINE,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark olive green with warm, brown undertones and a pearly sheen. It had excellent pigmentation that applied smoothly and evenly on the skin. The powder felt soft, smooth, and almost cream-like‚Äìa great balance of density and firmness without making it a difficult product to blend out on the skin. It wore well for eight hours on me.",A
COLOUR POP,TEAM CAPTAIN,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark olive green with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good color coverage paired with a smooth, finely-milled consistency that was a touch dusty in the pan but did not appear dry or chalky on the lid. The color wore for just over eight hours before fading.",B+
ESTEE LAUDER,HEAT WAVE,Highlighter,"a bright, medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. It appeared more metallic when I swatched it than when I applied to my cheek bones, though when I applied it more heavily or with a damp brush, it started to take on a more noticeable sheen. I did not feel like it emphasized my skin‚Äôs natural texture, though, even when applied heavily.",A
MAC,TROPIC COOL TIMES NINE,Palette,"nine, dime-sized eyeshadows in an assortment of yellow, green, and blue. It‚Äôs a bolder, brighter set of shades, but it also had a very smoldering edge with the deeper blue and bluish-gray inclusions. As you might expect, the yellowy shades need a primer to look as they do in the pan, but I also had some trouble with two of the darker blues.",B
BITE BEAUTY,#014,Lipstick,"a brighter, medium-dark plum with cooler undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered the lips with even color. The consistency was slightly soft, firm without being painful, and was forgiving enough that I was able to fill in most of my lips. It wore well for five and a half hours, and it was a touch drying toward the end. Bite Beauty recommends wearing this particular shade with Sake; I think it would work well with
Gin Fizz (brighter, lighter, cooler), Dragonfruit (brighter, deeper), Eggplant (darker), or Mauvember (darker) ‚Äî see comparison swatches.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,#016,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark plum with strong, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable color payoff with a soft, velvety texture that glided on with only a bit of tugging when I went to fill in my lips. It was more comfortable to apply along the edges of the lips, though. The lip pencil lasted for six hours on its own, and it was just a touch drying at the end. Bite Beauty recommends wearing this particular shade with Pepper, Chai, or Rhubarb; I think it would work well with Rhubarb (brighter) or Pepper (warmer) ‚Äî see comparison swatches.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,#018,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark plummy brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly. The consistency was thin, clingy but not actually drying or uncomfortable to wear, and soft enough that it spread fairly easily without tugging on the lips for full-color application. This shade stayed on for six hours on its own, and it was neither drying nor hydrating over time. Bite Beauty recommends wearing this particular shade with Honeycomb; I think it would work well with Pepper (slightly cooler), Chai (brighter), Verbena (brighter), Sweet Cream (lighter, brighter), or Rhubarb (cooler) ‚Äî see comparison swatches.",A
NYX,DAYTIME HALO,Highlighter,"a pop of gold with warm, yellow undertones and a fine, pearly sheen. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that applied evenly to the skin. The texture was thin, watery but not difficult to apply or blend out. The yellowness of the color seemed to get lost on me when I tried it, but it may be more prominent on cooler and/or lighter complexions. The highlighter stayed on well for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
COLOUR POP,OUTTA LUCK,Eyeshadow,"a soft, light-medium peachy beige with warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had good pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly on the skin. The consistency was soft, a little dusty but finely-milled. I noticed slight fading after seven and a half hours of wear.",B+
COLOUR POP,PEP TALK,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium, golden peach with warm, orange undertones and a metallic finish. This shade applied and looked much, much lighter on than it did in the pan (where it seemed more like a coral hue). The texture was soft, a touch dry but easy to blend and apply to bare skin in practice. It had opaque color coverage that stayed on well for eight hours.",A-
COLOUR POP,TIME OUT,Eyeshadow,"a medium, peachy coral with warm, yellow undertones and chunks of larger sparkle and pearl. It had semi-sheer color coverage, which was partially due to the much looser, chunkier texture that made it difficult to apply evenly to bare skin. Even over primer, it was disappointing‚Äìthis shade needs an adhesive primer to help it. There was fallout within a few hours of wear, and it started to crease after five hours.",D-
COLOUR POP,THE NEWS,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium coral with a hint of pink paired with a mostly matte finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage paired with a soft, finely-milled consistency that had more substance to it so it did not sheer out when applied to bare skin. It had a bit of excess product that kicked up in the pan, but it wasn‚Äôt problematic on the eyes. This shade wore well for seven and a half hours before fading.",B+
COLOUR POP,PLAY BY PLAY,Eyeshadow,"a bright, light-medium golden orange with warm, orange undertones and a flash of green-to-gold frost. It was almost a duochrome, but the shift seemed rather subtle to my eye, even in person. The texture was a little looser to the touch, so it sheered out a bit when applied to bare skin. The eyeshadow had good pigmentation, though, and lasted for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
ESTEE LAUDER,UNINHIBITED,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark orange-red with warm undertones and a soft sheen. It was richly pigmented with a creamy, hydrating consistency that applied evenly across the lips. The texture was lightweight, comfortable to wear, and made my lips appear smoother. This shade wore well for seven hours on me.",A
ESTEE LAUDER,NOIRISH,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark coral-red with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage that went on smoothly and evenly. The lipstick was lightly creamy, didn‚Äôt drag but didn‚Äôt feel slippery on, and held onto the lips well for over six hours. The formula was moisturizing while worn.",A
ESTEE LAUDER,BOLDFACE,Lipstick,"a deep red with cool undertones and as atin sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly across the lips without tugging on them. It had a lightweight, thinner consistency that was comfortable to wear and didn‚Äôt feel clingy. This shade stayed on well for over seven hours, left a stain behind, and was still hydrating the whole time.",A
NARS,PUSSY CONTROL,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark purple with subtle, warmer pink undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good color payoff, though it was not quite opaque without building up the color in layers. The consistency was smooth, velvety, and glided on easily, while the lip color sat fairly well on the lips but some texture was emphasized. This shade wore for four and a half hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
NARS,DOLCE VITA,Lipstick,"a muted, medium rosy coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had medium coverage, which I could build up to semi-opaque but could never manage full coverage from this particular shade. The consistency was lightweight and glided on without tugging, but it seemed to feel and look more powdery on the lips. On me, it wore well for four and a half hours but some color pulled into my lip lines over time.",B
NARS,POP LIFE,Lipstick,"a brighter, medium red with warm undertones and fine, gold pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly, despite not building up to full coverage. The consistency was lightweight, thin but velvety in feel, so it was comfortable to apply. It lasted for five hours and was slightly drying.",B+
LORAC,CALIFORNIA DREAMING,Palette,"twelve eyeshadows in both matte and shimmer finishes. The palette runs warmer, but it seemed more like a neutral palette with pops of rose and mauve accents. The formula felt looser and drier overall; sort of like LORAC‚Äôs ‚Äúfiller‚Äù formula, when they put together more affordable palettes but aren‚Äôt part of their Pro collection (which always has a silkier, more refined feel). I find that this formula can be better or worse depending on the shades and finishes. The downsides of the formula tend to be that they are prone to fading more quickly and sheering out, so a good primer is an absolute must-have to make this palette wear and perform well.",C+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,TANTALIZE,Palette,"a light-medium orange-coral and a bright, coral-red. Both shades performed fairly well, though the deeper shade performed exceptionally well as it was incredibly pigmented and applied beautifully.",A-
MAC,RED-HOT TIMES NINE,Palette,"nine, dime-sized eyeshadows. For the types of colors and finishes included in the palette, it was actually not bad. I‚Äôd definitely suggest using this with a primer to improve blendability and pigmentation across the palette, though.",B
BITE BEAUTY,#008,Lipstick,"a muted, peachy coral with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had good color coverage that went on evenly and smoothly. The texture was velvety but not actually wet, creamy, or emollient, and it was thinner overall, so it clung to lips. I didn‚Äôt feel like it was drying, nor was it uncomfortable to wear, but it did emphasize my lip lines a bit on its own. It lasted for five hours by itself and was neither drying nor hydrating. Bite Beauty recommends wearing this particular shade with Meringue; I think it would work well with Sorbet (brighter, pinker), Rhubarb (darker), Meringue (lighter, slightly warmer), or Fig (darker, cooler) ‚Äî see comparison swatches.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,#010,Lipstick,"a muted, rosy plum with subtle, warm undertones and a pearl sheen. The consistency was firmer and harder to spread; the pearl finish seemed to be more unforgiving than the more matte shades in the formula. It felt clingy, thin, and was harder to spread and build-up coverage. I felt like this was only tolerable to define the edges of my lips rather than all-over. It lasted for five hours but felt somewhat drying. Bite Beauty recommends wearing this particular shade with Sake or Pepper; I think it would work well with Rhubarb (darker), Sake (lighter, cooler), and Pepper (darker) ‚Äî see comparison swatches.",C+
BITE BEAUTY,#012,Lipstick,"a light-medium, muted pink with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had good pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. There was enough substance to the texture that it didn‚Äôt make my lips appear drier or more textured than they naturally were. The color lasted for five hours and was non-drying. Bite Beauty recommends wearing this particular shade with Thistle; I think it would work well with Sake (darker), Sugarcane (lighter, warmer), Souffle (lighter), and Thistle (darker, cooler) ‚Äî see comparison swatches.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,(POP)ULAR,Eyeliner,"bright, medium pinky-red with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that applied evenly to the lash line. The texture was smooth, creamy, and comfortable to apply and to wear. It stayed on well for nine hours on my waterline and twelve hours on my lower lash line.",A-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,WHIRL(POOL),Eyeliner,"a bright, medium bluish-teal with cooler undertones and a matte finish. It was richly pigmented with full coverage in a single layer. The eyeliner had a creamy, glide-on texture that never tugged or pulled on the skin. It wore well for ten hours on my waterline and twelve hours on my lower lash line.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,OUT OF THE BLUE,Eyeliner,"a bright cobalt blue with strong, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in one pass, and the texture was smooth, creamy, and comfortable to apply as it did not tug on my lash line. The eyeliner wore well for nine hours on my waterline and twelve hours on my lower lash line.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,MIST ME,Eyeliner,"a bright, medium lavender purple with cooler undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had medium, buildable color payoff that applied smoothly and evenly to the skin. The texture was creamy and smooth without being too emollient. This shade stayed for eight hours on waterline and eleven hours on my lower lash line.",B+
ESTEE LAUDER,ROSE TEA,Lipstick,"a soft, pinky mauve with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had good color coverage, though not quite opaque, that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips without tugging. The lipstick was creamy, lightweight, and hydrating without being too slippery on the lips. This shade stayed on well for just over five hours on me.",A-
ESTEE LAUDER,INESCAPABLE,Lipstick,"a soft, medium-dark rosy pink with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly on the lips. The consistency was lightweight, creamy without being thick or slippery, and comfortable to wear. It wore well for six hours and was hydrating over time.",A
ESTEE LAUDER,INCENSED,Lipstick,"a deep pink with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had good color payoff, though shy of full coverage, with a creamy, lightly emollient consistency. The lipstick applied evenly and was comfortable to wear as the formula felt hydrating. There was a bit of color that pulled into my deeper lip lines, but it wasn‚Äôt too noticeable from a normal viewing distance. This shade wore well for six hours on me.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,RAVISH,Blush,"deep, reddish copper with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. The original version was a bit lighter, more pink than copper, and definitely more shimmery (see comparison here). The texture was soft, finely-milled, and a little thin, though I had no trouble applying or blending out the color on my cheeks. It had rich color payoff, which was not true to the claim of buildable, but with a lighter hand and less dense blush (something like a fan or highlighter brush), sheerer coverage was certainly possible. The color stayed true for nine and a half hours on me.",A-
LORAC,CALIFORNIA DREAMING,Palette,"four cheek colors to add ‚Äúhighlight, color, and glow‚Äù to your skin. The texture of the four shades was very similar to their permanent Colour Source Buildable Blush and Light Source Highlighter formulas. They felt smooth, soft without being too dusty or dry on the skin, and had pigmentation that ranged from medium to opaque (the ‚Äúdownside‚Äù to both formulas has always been they‚Äôre often more pigmented than buildable, which you may prefer or may be a deal breaker). This is a rather warm-toned palette, so it will work best for someone who likes warmer, brown and peach shades along with a fair amount of shimmer.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,#002,Lipstick,"a light-medium pink with strong, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good pigmentation in one stroke, and it applied decently for all-over color on my lips. The texture was thin, smooth without being truly creamy or emollient, and I found the best way to smooth and even out the color was to press and lightly rub my lips together. This shade lasted for five hours on its own and was non-drying but some color seemed to clump in my lip lines. Bite Beauty recommends wearing this particular liner with Sugarcane; I think it would work well with Sorbet (slightly darker, pinker), Meringue (lighter, warmer), Sugarcane (lighter), and Fig (darker) ‚Äî see comparison swatches.",B
BITE BEAUTY,#004,Lipstick,"a light-medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had great pigmentation‚Äìnearly opaque‚Äìwith a lightweight, thin but not clingy, texture that was fairly comfortable to apply and blended well for even coverage. The color wore well for five hours on its own and was non-drying. Bite Beauty recommends wearing this particular liner with Sugarcane or Fig; I think it would work well with Sorbet (a bit brighter) or Fig (darker) ‚Äî see comparison swatches.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,#006,Lipstick,"a light-medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly without tugging on the lips. The texture was thin, a little clingy with a touch of tackiness, but it was comfortable to wear for the five hours it lasted for. Bite Beauty recommends wearing this particular shade with Sugarcane, Fig, or Meringue; I think it would work well with Sake (darker, more muted), Fig (darker, warmer), and Sugarcane (lighter, warmer) ‚Äî see comparison swatches.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,SABOTEUR,Palette,"a bright, magenta purple and a deep, reddish burgundy. This was another duo where one shade applied well (the purple), while the darker (burgundy) shade fell short due to having a ton of slip to its texture, which caused it to slide around and feather.",B+
NYX,ROSE QUARTZ,Highlighter,"a medium-dark reddish copper with warm undertones and gold and copper pearl. It had sheer coverage, which was buildable to medium coverage‚Äìit looked a bit like a cheek stain on me, as it was translucent but provided some visible color (when layered). The texture was watery, thin, and spreadable across the skin, but it dried down and lasted for eight hours on me.",B+
URBAN DECAY,WSM,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark plum with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage, which would have been opaque with a second layer. The consistency was thin, almost watery, but it spread well across the lips and applied the color evenly. It dried down to a mostly matte finish, though if I pressed my lips together, there was a barely-there tackiness. This shade wore well for five hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,(EARTH)QUAKE,Eyeliner,"a deep brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had intense color coverage in just one pass, while the eyeliner had a smooth, creamy texture that glided across the skin without tugging or dragging. The color wore well for nine hours on my waterline and twelve hours on my lower lash line.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,(BROWN)IE,Eyeliner,"a rich, medium-dark brown with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had opaque coverage in a single with a very creamy, smooth, and glide-on texture that was comfortable to use on the lower lash line and waterline. This shade wore well for eleven hours on my lower lash line and eight hours on my waterline.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,(IRON)Y,Eyeliner,"a deep, gray-leaning taupe with hints of warmer, brown undertones paired with a cream finish. The eyeliner was incredibly rich in pigmentation, while the consistency was smooth, creamy, and comfortable to apply as it did not tug. On my waterline, the color stayed on well for almost ten hours, and on my lower lash line, it lasted for a full twelve hours.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,FINE(WINE),Eyeliner,"a deep red with subtle, cool undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was fairly buildable, though it always seemed just shy of full coverage. I think that part of that was due to the texture, which seemed to have more slip, and I found I had better luck applying one layer, letting it dry down and set, and then a second layer to obtain the best pigmentation. The eyeliner applied comfortably and lasted for nine hours on the waterline and twelve hours on the lower lash line.",B+
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,DEJA BLUE,Eyeliner,"a deep red with subtle, cool undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was fairly buildable, though it always seemed just shy of full coverage. I think that part of that was due to the texture, which seemed to have more slip, and I found I had better luck applying one layer, letting it dry down and set, and then a second layer to obtain the best pigmentation. The eyeliner applied comfortably and lasted for nine hours on the waterline and twelve hours on the lower lash line.",B
COLOURED RAINE,BIRTHDAY SUIT,Eyeshadow,"a soft, light-medium peach with warm, yellow undertones and a satin finish. The consistency was soft, blendable, and smooth without being too powdery or too firm in the pan. It had great color payoff that applied evenly to the skin and lasted for eight hours on me.",A
COLOURED RAINE,CINNAMON LUST,Eyeshadow,"a medium brown with warm undertones and a satin sheen. It had good color coverage, though it took a little extra layering to get it to be fully opaque as the texture was looser and prone to sheering out on the lid. It was very blendable, so it was easy to work with in practice. On me, this shade started to fade noticeably after seven and a half hours of wear.",B
COLOURED RAINE,S'MORES,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark bronzy brown with warm, reddish undertones and a fine, golden sheen. It had good pigmentation, though the texture was a little drier than most shades have been in the range (especially for a more shimmery shade). The color applied well to bare skin but had a tendency to sheer out a bit on the skin. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading.",B+
COLOURED RAINE,VINTAGE,Eyeshadow,"a rich, coppery red with warm undertones and a frosted sheen. It was intensely pigmented with an almost cream-like texture‚Äìdense, smooth, and adhered beautifully to bare skin. The eyeshadow stayed on well for almost nine hours.",A+
NYX,MOON GLOW,Highlighter,"a pale white with neutral-to-cool undertones and a very fine pearl. This was one of the least ‚Äúshimmery‚Äô‚Äù shades, though it still gave the skin a subtle sheen. It seemed to be more watery than most shades, which may have accounted for its sheerer coverage that was only buildable to medium coverage. It dried down quickly but still gave me enough time to work with the product and blend it out evenly. The highlighter lasted for just over seven and a half hours on me.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,LOVE LUST,Blush,"a light-medium peachy coral with warm undertones and a frosted, golden finish. This was the most shimmery shade out of the entire range, though it was still not quite as shimmery as the prior version of Love Lust‚Äìand the color is completely different (see comparison), as the original was darker and more pink-based. The consistency was soft, lightly dusty, and blendable on the skin. It had semi-opaque, buildable coverage that wore well for nine and a half hours before fading on me.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,FLUSH,Blush,"a bright pop of peony pink with warm undertones and a satin sheen. The color looked nothing like the original shade (see comparison), which was darker, warmer, and more shimmery‚Äìwe‚Äôre talking about a bright pink compared to a rich, true coral.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,LOVE LUST,Blush,"a light-medium peachy coral with warm undertones and a frosted, golden finish. This was the most shimmery shade out of the entire range, though it was still not quite as shimmery as the prior version of Love Lust‚Äìand the color is completely different (see comparison), as the original was darker and more pink-based. The consistency was soft, lightly dusty, and blendable on the skin. It had semi-opaque, buildable coverage that wore well for nine and a half hours before fading on me.",A
COLOUR POP,ONE OF A KIND,Palette,"a rich berry and a shimmering, cranberry red. They worked well together, but the look was very dark and red-toned, which won‚Äôt work for everyone. Of all of the new duos, this one seemed like the one would be most versatile paired with other shades rather than used as a standalone duo. This duo is limited edition and part of the brand‚Äôs Valentine‚Äôs Day collection, but ColourPop is releasing them as singles today.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,POSSESSION,Palette,"a bright, medium pink and a darker, fuchsia pink. The lighter shade could have been a bit more pigmented, while both shades could have applied more evenly. The darker shade was bright enough that its shortcomings in texture weren‚Äôt as noticeable. I would recommend using a lip liner with this duo to maximize its potential, though.",B+
COLOUR POP,MEANT TO BE,Palette,"a shimmering, peachy-orange and a vibrant pink-coral. The lighter shade is very shimmery, and the texture was denser and had more substance to it compared to the darker coral, so they didn‚Äôt quite layer as well together as I would have liked. If I diffused the shimmery shade enough, it was workable, especially if I layered the darker coral over it rather than trying to get the shimmer to layer over the coral. This duo is limited edition and part of the brand‚Äôs Valentine‚Äôs Day collection, but ColourPop is releasing them as singles today.",A-
CHANEL,NUDE,Lipstick,"a soft, medium brown with warm, rosy undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that went on evenly, but some of the color slipped into my lip lines. The consistency was smooth, creamy, wet but not too slippery, and comfortable to wear, as it was quite hydrating. This shade lasted for three and a half hours on me.",B-
CHANEL,ROSE CLAIR,Lipstick,"a soft, medum pink with warm undertones and a fine, pearly finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was easy to apply and work with, but it did not build up to opaque coverage for me. The texture was creamy, soft (almost melted upon contact), and smooth on the lips. This shade wore nicely for four hours and was hydrating.",B+
CHANEL,ROUGE,Lipstick,"a rich, medium red with neutral-to-cool undertones and a barely-there pearl. It had semi-opaque color coverage, which applied evenly and smoothly. The consistency was creamy, thin without being too thin or clingy, and easy to spread across the lips. The formula felt moisturizing over the five and a half hours this shade lasted for. It also left a subtle stain behind.",A-
NYX,CRYSTAL GLARE,Highlighter,"a light, golden beige with warm undertones and fine, pearly sheen. The shimmer read as a luminous glow than overt shimmer on the skin, even when layered. It had semi-sheer to opaque, buildable coverage (two to three layers for more opaque coverage, though!). The consistency was thin, water-like but dried down after I blended it onto the skin. This shade would be ideal for someone who wants subtle warmth and sheen without a metallic finish. While it could absolutely be mixed in with base products, like a primer or foundation, the wand makes it most practical for dabbing onto the face. The highlighter wore nicely for seven and a half hours on me.",A-
TOO FACED,ULTIMATE EYE COLLECTION,Palette,"two palettes that ‚Äúlock‚Äù together magnetically. Each palette has six eyeshadows, and the set of palettes also came with a black liquid eyeliner and full-sized black mascara. The palette was decent, but the shades released by both brands are the kind that we have definitely seen before so if you‚Äôre already a fan of both brands, you might have palettes with these shades already.",B
TOO FACED,CHEEK & LIP MAKEUP BAG SET,Palette,"a lipstick, liquid lipstick, blush, and highlighting powder that come with a heart-shaped makeup bag. The bag itself is fairly small and very flat, so it was hard to use.",B-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,SUBLIMATE,Palette,"a cream highlighter and cream blush. The formula is touted as ‚Äúsuper sheer,‚Äù and that‚Äôs what you get: incredibly sheer, almost translucent color. Both shades are sheer and barely-there with a dewy finish that never sets or dries down, and as a result, the wear was between three to four hours. Despite never setting, they didn‚Äôt feel tacky, just a little emollient to the touch, and can handle a powder being patted on top (though the dewiness went away completely). I wish they lasted longer, but as they have such short wear, it‚Äôs not a very practical product for most. I think this will be best for someone who doesn‚Äôt need their makeup to last long, has drier skin (perhaps it would last longer), and/or wants a sheerer base for their powder blushes.",C+
MAC,BETTY BOOP RED,Lipstick,"a bright, medium red with cool undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. The consistency was smooth, lightly creamy but not too emollient, and comfortable to wear. Though it was listed as a matte finish on the packaging, it did not read matte on me until after an hour and a half of wear. The color wore well for over six hours, left a stain behind, and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
COLOUR POP,APPLE OF MY EYE,Palette,"a light-medium pink and a rich, magenta purple. The two shades complemented each other well, as they could greate a nice gradient while still offering nice contrast between the two shades. Both shades were pigmented, easy to blend, and wore fairly well. This duo is limited edition and part of the brand‚Äôs Valentine‚Äôs Day collection, but ColourPop is releasing them as singles today.",A
COLOUR POP,GOODY TWO-SHOES,Eyeshadow,"a dark, charcoal gray with warmer, brown undertones and cooler pearl‚Äìit read cooler overall. The new Pressed Powder Shadow formula is supposed to be ‚Äúhighly pigmented‚Äù with an ‚Äúultra-velvety and silky‚Äù texture that is ‚Äúlong-wearing‚Äù and ‚Äúadheres easily to the eyes.‚Äù It had excellent pigmentation with a smooth, blendable texture that adhered evenly to the skin. This shade wore well for eight hours on me before fading.",A-
COLOUR POP,WAIT FOR IT,Eyeshadow,"a medium coral-orange with warm undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was a bit firmer in the pan, but it wasn‚Äôt too difficult to blend out overall. It had good, buildable pigmentation that applied evenly to the skin. This shade started to fade after seven hours of wear.",B
COLOUR POP,MAKING MOVES,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had intense pigmentation that adhered well to bare skin, despite having a more powdery feel in the pan (plenty of excess product kicked up in the pan, even with a light touch!). The eyeshadow blended out fairly well and lasted for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
COLOUR POP,SILVER LINING,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark purple with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-sheer pigmentation paired with a very powdery consistency. The eyeshadow sheered out too readily, so there was a lot of fallout and an inability to build up the color without a tacky, white base. It lasted for five hours on me.",F
COLOUR POP,COME AND GET IT,Eyeshadow,"a bright pop of pink with cooler undertones and warmer, golden shimmer that gave it a more metallic finish. The eyeshadow had a denser, more cream-like consistency in the pan, which made it thicker on the lid. This helped it adhere and apply more smoothly, but it was harder to layer and blend with the matte formula (which has a thinner consistency typically). This shade wore well for eight hours on me.",A-
COLOUR POP,STAY GOLDEN,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark red with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had intense pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin. The eyeshadow had a very powdery texture, though, and there was some fallout during application. The color started to fade after seven and a half hours of wear.",B+
KEVYN AUCOIN,IBIZA,Palette,"a mega-sized cheek palette with three shades of highlighter that form a gradient from pale gold to light lavender to lavender. When mixed together, the effect was a light-medium lavender with a subtle warmth and a luminous finish. Each shade was wide enough to be worn alone, though there‚Äôs no distinct beginning and end for the shades. The consistency of the palette was fairly smooth, soft, and blendable, while the pigmentation varied from semi-opaque to opaque. The only shade I had trouble with was the darker lavender, which was drier in feel and had buildable coverage. There was a bit of excess powder that kicked up in the pan, but it did not read powdery or dry on the skin. The effect was moderate to high in shine, so the palette would work best for someone who likes a stronger highlighter/highlighting blush.",B+
LORAC,PANORAMA,Blush,"a light-medium lavender with cooler undertones and a soft, luminous sheen. It had good pigmentation, which was easily buildable to opaque, true-to-pan coverage with a second layer. The powder felt soft, smooth, and silky and wasn‚Äôt powdery at all. It blended out beautifully on the skin and had a luminous finish that looked glowing but not shimmery. The blush wore nicely on my skin for eight and a half hours before fading noticeably.",A
LORAC,LUMA,Blush,"a light peachy-pink with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. The very light color made me nervous to apply to my skin tone, but it actually worked well, as it seemed to darken slightly and the shimmer prevented the lighter base color from looking chalky. I still think this is going to be easier for lighter complexions to wear, but it may work as a highlighting blush on medium complexions as well. The consistency was soft and smooth to the touch, but it was more powdery and thin compared to other shades I‚Äôve tried in this formula, so it had a tendency to sheer out on the skin‚Äìgreat for blending, not so great for achieving true-to-pan color. On me, it wore well for eight hours.",B
LORAC,LIMELIGHT,Highlighter,"a light, minty green with subtle, warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It seemed to appear cooler in the pan, but the shimmer itself seemed warmer (like a pale gold) so that it appeared warmer as I blended out the color. The consistency was soft, smooth, and a touch thin, but it applied well to bare skin and blended out with ease. It had a high-shine finish‚Äìdefinitely not a subtle highlighter‚Äìbut did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. This was a fun highlight to work with, as the aqua hue transformed anything I paired it with. On my normal-to-dry skin, the highlighter wore well for eight hours before fading.",A-
COLOUR POP,BOYFRIEND STEALER,Palette,"a muted, medium pink and a darker, rosy plum (both with warmer undertones). The two shades could be used together, as they created a nice gradient, but I‚Äôd likely reach for a darker or lighter shade to add more contrast. This duo is limited edition and part of the brand‚Äôs Valentine‚Äôs Day collection. Some of the duos are sold out, and I really hope ColourPop will consider releasing the shades individually, at the very least they are on 2/14!",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,IMPULSE,Palette,"a lipstick duo that features a formula that is supposed to have ‚Äúrich color‚Äù and ‚Äúadherence‚Äù with a ‚Äúvelvet matte finish.‚Äù The duos are designed to have a lighter shade and a darker shade, and they can be worn alone, mixed, or as an ombre lip look. There was also a dual-ended applicator‚Äìa sponge on one end and a brush on the other‚Äìbut the sponge really did not work well to apply the color, as it yielded sheer coverage and seemed to suck all the emollient qualities out of the formula and left behind a drier, almost powdery texture on the lips. The lip brush worked, but for me, the tiny applicator was harder to control and took me three to four times as long to apply compared to a traditional lip brush (which has a longer handle).",B
COLOUR POP,TWO TO TANGO,Palette,"a shimmering purple and a deep plum. The two shades complemented each other well, though neither was particularly standout in terms of quality. This duo definitely needed a primer and some extra effort to work well. This duo is limited edition and part of the brand‚Äôs Valentine‚Äôs Day collection. Some of the duos are sold out, and I really hope ColourPop will consider releasing the shades individually, at the very least.",B-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,SCINTILLATE,Palette,"a cream highlighter and cream blush. You get plenty of product in the compact, but the product itself is just that type of product that for someone will be essential and for many others, totally unnecessary and almost am ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get it‚Äù kind of product. Both shades are sheer and barely-there with a dewy finish that never sets or dries down, and as a result, the wear was between three to four hours. The formula is, however, touted as ‚Äúsuper sheer,‚Äù so the coverage level is as described. Despite never setting, they didn‚Äôt feel tacky, just a little emollient to the touch, and can handle a powder being patted on top (though the dewiness went away completely). I think this will be best for someone who doesn‚Äôt need their makeup to last long, has drier skin (perhaps it would last longer), and/or wants a sheerer base for their powder blushes.",C
URBAN DECAY,PURGATORY,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark plum with subtle, warm undertones and flecks of fuchsia and plum sparkle. It had medium coverage, which was buildable to opaque coverage in two to three layers. The consistency was thin, watery, and difficult to apply evenly, as the color appeared patchy and settled into lip lines. It took a long time to dry, and it felt lightly tacky for an hour after applying it. It lasted for five hours before color started to fade noticeably.",D+
URBAN DECAY,ROCK STEADY,Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium-dark red with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation, though not full coverage, in one layer. The liquid lipstick was fluid without being too watery or thin, and the color spread evenly and dried down to a flat, matte finish after a couple of minutes. It wore well for six and a half hours and left a subtle stain behind. The formula felt neither drying nor hydrating to me.",A-
URBAN DECAY,DOUBLE CROSSED,Lipstick,"a deep, muted purple with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which would have been opaque with a second layer. The texture wasn‚Äôt too thin or too thick, so the product spread well across the lips. There was slight unevenness, but it wasn‚Äôt too noticeable. The color wore well for six and a half hours on me.",B+
ANASTASIA,VOL. 1,Palette,"13 distinct hades along with 5 primary colors (which can be used on their own or used to mix with other shades in the palette). The palette also included a dual-ended tool, which had a flat, lip brush on one end and a metal spatula on the other end, and a small mixing palette. The formula is supposed to be ‚Äúhighly pigmented‚Äù and ‚Äúlong-wearing.‚Äù In general, they were fairly pigmented without requiring too much product (though it never felt like I barely needed product either‚Äìpigmented but not 150% pigmented, if that makes sense!). They were thin without being clingy, lightly creamy but eventually wore down to a more matte, flat finish (one to two hours). The wear varied from shade to shade‚Äìanywhere from three to six hours‚Äìand a few were drying, some were slightly drying, and some were non-drying.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,ROSEWOOD (105),Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark mauve with neutral-to-warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly on the lips. The liquid lipstick felt thin without being watery, so it spread easily across the lips but did not appear streaky. The color stayed on nicely for six and a half hours, and the formula was mostly non-drying.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,COLD PINK (203),Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque color payoff that went on fairly well, though there were a few streaks even after the liquid lipstick dried down. The texture was lightweight, thin but not watery, and spread easily (almost too easily!) across the lips. This shade lasted for seven hours on me before fading, and it was neither drying nor hydrating over time.",A-
MAC,GRITTY GIRL,Lipstick,"muted, medium brown with neutral-to-warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It was richly pigmented with a creamy, thicker texture that seemed to emphasize the texture of my lips slightly. The color went on evenly and adhered well to my lips, so the color managed to last for a solid five hours despite being a lighter shade. It was slightly drying over time, though.",A-
MAC,COLD HARD CASH,Lipstick,"a light-medium, rosy brown with warm undertones and a soft sheen. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly without dragging on my lips. The texture was a bit thicker, and it separated near my deeper lip lines slightly. The formula was comfortable to wear and neither drying nor hydrating over the five hours the lipstick lasted.",A-
MAC,SECRET NUMBER,Lipstick,"a dark taupe brown with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage that went on fairly evenly, though I wasn‚Äôt able to apply it as evenly or as opaquely on the inner area of my lips (I tried a few times and it kept applying the same). The texture was creamy, not too thin or too thick, and applied without tugging. It wore well for five hours and was non-drying.",A-
MAC,HIGH DRAMA,Lipstick,"a deep berry with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied somewhat evenly. As it dried down, the color didn‚Äôt self-level so there were some visible streaks. The formula had a more watery consistency, which made it harder to apply and control along the edges of the lips, and the color seemed to sink into some lip lines. This shade lasted for six and a half hours before starting to fade on me, and the formula was somewhat drying.",C
MAC,INTO THE MADNESS,Lipstick,"a bright, light-medium chartreuse green with warm, yellow undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable coverage (almost to full coverage) that applied evenly. The consistency was lightly creamy, not too thick or too thin, and was comfortable to wear, though I had some color pull into lip lines over time. This shade wore well for four and a half hours and gave my lips a slightly peachy stain, and the formula was neither drying nor hydrating.",B
MAC,ENHANCE ME,Palette,"six cream-based shades that can be used on lips or cheeks. The Casual Colour formula is supposed to be a cheek and lip color with a ‚Äúdewy‚Äù glow that‚Äôs blendable and hydrating. In general, I like the Casual Colour as a cream blush‚Äìpigmented, blendable, long-wearing‚Äìbut it falls flat as a lip color, as there‚Äôs an almost powder-like feel once they‚Äôre on that makes the formula feel clingy and slightly drying over time. The best way (that I‚Äôve found) to use them as a lip color is to apply them lightly on the lips and topped with a balm or sheer gloss as more of a subtle lip stain.",B
URBAN DECAY,NAKED,Lipstick,"a soft, medium pink with warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage that went on fairly evenly with some color that pulled into lip lines and dried there, so there was a ‚Äúcracked‚Äù look to the finish when I smiled. The consistency was thin but comfortable to wear, but it did not seem to dry down fully‚Äìthere was a touch of tackiness that lingered (but it did not pull up color after the initial ‚Äúdry down‚Äù phase). This shade lasted for four and a half hours before fading noticeably.",C
URBAN DECAY,FLAME,Lipstick,"a medium-dark coral-orange with larger and smaller gold and copper glitter. It had sheer coverage, which was dismal at building up (even after I waited for the first layer to dry down) and looked all-around awful on the lips‚Äìchunky, uneven, patchy, and emphasizing of my lip lines. It seemed to flake away and fade within a few hours. The formula was, at least, non-drying.",F
URBAN DECAY,1993,Lipstick,"a medium-dark brown with soft, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied somewhat unevenly. It dried down fairly quickly but started to feel a touch tacky after I had a couple of sips of water (just regular water, nothing special!). The consistency was thin, watery, and harder to maneuver along the edges with precision. This shade started to fade noticeably after four hours of wear on me, though it was non-drying.",C-
COLOUR POP,WAKE UP CALL,Eyeshadow,"a light, peachy brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. The new Pressed Powder Shadow formula is supposed to be ‚Äúhighly pigmented‚Äù with an ‚Äúultra-velvety and silky‚Äù texture that is ‚Äúlong-wearing‚Äù and ‚Äúadheres easily to the eyes.‚Äù It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which did not seem to build on me at all. When I tried it over an eyeshadow primer, it seemed to look richer but the consistency still seemed thinner and felt firmer in the pan. It started to fade on me after seven hours of wear.",B-
COLOUR POP,MADE TO LAST,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark mauve with warm undertones and a matte finish. It was lightly powdery, though blendable and certainly finely-milled. The eyeshadow had good, buildable color payoff that went on evenly on bare skin but sheered out a bit too easily, so it was hard to achieve true, opaque coverage without a primer. On me, this shade wore for seven hours before fading.",B
COLOUR POP,PAPER TIGER,Eyeshadow,"a brighter, medium mustard yellow with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation, which was buildable to opaque coverage in two layers. The texture was smooth, soft without being dusty, and blendable on the skin. I noticed the eyeshadow looked faded after seven hours of wear.",B+
COLOUR POP,POPULAR DEMAND,Eyeshadow,"a dark brown with warm, red undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that applied evenly and wasn‚Äôt difficult to layer. The texture was lightly dusty but felt smooth and finely-milled to the touch. The eyeshadow wore nicely for just over seven and a half hours on me.",B
COLOUR POP,TAKE THE LEAD,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark gray-leaning taupe with a matte finish. It had good color payoff that built-up to opaque coverage with two layers. The texture was soft, a touch dusty but not too messy in the pan and didn‚Äôt leave fallout during application. On me, the color wore well for seven hours before fading.",B
COLOUR POP,NOTE TO SELF,Eyeshadow,"a medium brown with warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had nearly opaque color payoff paired with a smooth, lightly powdery texture that was very blendable on the lid but adhered smoothly and evenly without primer. This shade started to fade after seven and a half hours on me.",A-
NARS,BELLE-ILE,Eyeshadow,"a brighter, medium copper with warm, orange undertones and a golden, pearly sheen. It had semi-sheer coverage, which I was able to build to nearly full coverage with three layers of product. The texture was smooth, slightly creamy but not quite as emollient as most shades in the range. There was some unevenness in the texture as I layered the color, though it did not appear patchy. I noticed creasing after six hours of wear.",D
NARS,SIROS,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark coppery bronze with warm undertones and a golden sheen that also had some larger bits of gold sparkle. It had medium coverage in one pass, which was buildable to opaque coverage in two to three layers. The consistency was creamy without being too emollient, so it was easy and comfortable to run along the eyelid. This shade started to show signs of creasing after six hours of wear.",C
NARS,USBEK,Eyeshadow,"a vibrant, medium-dark purple with warmer, plummy undertones and a cooler, blue and violet pearl finish. It had a smooth, creamy consistency that wasn‚Äôt too slick, so I was able to build the coverage from semi-opaque to opaque with two layers without getting any patchiness. The edges were a little harder to diffuse compared to a powder eyeshadow, and the richer color made that more apparent. It wore well for six hours on me before creasing.",C+
NARS,GRAND LARGE,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium sky blue with cool undertones and a metallic sheen. It had sheer coverage, which was buildable to medium coverage, but the texture did no favors as it built up. The consistency, while creamy and smooth on the lid, bunched up and looked uneven and thicker in places as I tried to get more pigmentation out of it. It was really best applied as an all-over wash of color and used as a base for powder eyeshadow. It started to crease after five hours of wear on me.",F
NYX,CRUSHED BLOOM,Highlighter,"muted, medium-dark peach with warmer, yellow undertones and a pink-to-gold shift paired with a soft, pearl finish. It yielded such a lovely glow on the skin‚Äìluminous, glowing‚Äìbut never emphasized pores or appeared metallic. The shimmer in this particular shade seemed to be particularly fine.",A
MAC,CARMINE ROUGE,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark pink-red with cool undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable color payoff with a smooth, creamy texture that wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin. The lipstick applied evenly, sat well on the lips, and lasted for nearly eight hours. It also left a stain behind, and it was neither drying nor hydrating over time.",A
MAC,BREATHING FIRE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly full color coverage that went on evenly and smoothly. This shade has been released before, but this first seemed to have a touch more slip than the last time I tried it. The lipstick applied without tugging on my lips, and it was comfortable to wear. It was still going strong after six hours of wear and felt non-drying while worn, though there was a touch of color that pulled into my lip lines over time.",A-
MAC,BUNNYBEAMS,Lipstick,"a medium, pinky lavender with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied evenly on the lips. The texture was light-medium in weight, thicker but not heavy, but it seemed prone to pulling away at my lip lines so a liner or lip primer may be necessary if you have lines like I do. This shade wore well for five hours, left a pinkish stain behind, and was slightly hydrating.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,WARM BEIGE (103),Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark peachy brown with a hint of rose paired with a matte finish. The consistency was a touch thicker, easier to control than other shades in the same formula, but it took longer to dry down and didn‚Äôt fully self-level so there was visible streaking. The color ‚Äúcracked‚Äù slightly when I smiled at my deeper lip lines. It had opaque color coverage that lasted for a solid six hours on me before fading noticeably but was not drying.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,PRALINE (109),Lipstick,"a medium-dark plum with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, thin but not watery consistency that applied the color evenly across the lips. It dried down fast enough not to be awkwardly sitting there with my mouth hanging open but I had time to maneuver along the edges and smooth the color out. The color wore well for eight hours on me before fading, though it was slightly drying after five hours of wear.",A
COLOUR POP,HEAR ME OUT,Eyeshadow,"a light beige with a satin finish. The new Pressed Powder Shadow formula is supposed to be ‚Äúhighly pigmented‚Äù with an ‚Äúultra-velvety and silky‚Äù texture that is ‚Äúlong-wearing‚Äù and ‚Äúadheres easily to the eyes.‚Äù It had intense pigmentation with a very smooth, cream-like texture that was a bit powdery on the skin when I started to blend it out‚Äìwhere the powder dropped below the brow bone and had a tendency to lighten whatever it was on. I would recommend using a lot less than you think you might need and adding more if necessary to get a good feel for the pigmentation and texture. It started to fade after seven hours on me.",A-
COLOUR POP,FIRE FLY,Eyeshadow,"a soft beige with neutral-to-cool undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation (may be hard to tell, as the color is closer to my skin tone) that covered the skin evenly and smoothly. The eyeshadow felt soft, smooth, and was blendable when I used it over bare skin. This shade wore well for seven hours on me.",B+
COLOUR POP,LOCKED AND LOADED,Eyeshadow,"a soft, buttercup yellow with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was somewhat buildable, but I could not get opaque coverage without using a primer underneath, though. The color started to fade after seven hours of wear.",B
COLOUR POP,"LIAR, LIAR",Eyeshadow,"a light-medium peachy pink with warm undertones and a frosted finish. It had good color payoff with a soft, lightly dusty texture that was blendable and easy to apply to the eye. I noticed fading after seven hours of wear.",B+
COLOUR POP,LET ME EXPLAIN,Eyeshadow,"a light gold with warm undertones and a frosted finish. The powder was looser and felt a bit drier, which resulted in an eyeshadow that sheered out very easily and was hard to achieve opaque coverage as the powder would just dust away as soon as I started to blend it out. This one really needed a primer to work decently, even though it seemed pigmented otherwise. It lasted for seven hours before fading noticeably on me.",B-
COLOUR POP,BEL AIR,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation‚Äìalmost opaque‚Äìwith a soft, smooth texture that was a touch dusty but did not sheer out immediately, so it ended up being quite easy to work with and blend out on the skin. This shade wore well for seven hours on me.",B+
MAC,DIGGING IT,Lipstick,"a rich, mahogany brown with warm, reddish undertones and a satin finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage that went on evenly and smoothly. The texture was lightly creamy so it didn‚Äôt tug on my lips when I applied the color directly from the tube, but the consistency sat well on the lips and did not slide around over the six hours this shade lasted for. I noticed a slight, reddish stain left behind after wear. The formula was non-drying to me.",A
MAC,NIGHT MINT,Lipstick,"a soft, light-medium grayish green with a cream finish. It had good pigmentation and applied fairly evenly, despite the creamier, moderately emollient consistency that gave it a noticeable glossy sheen. I would have expected this to apply more unevenly and almost patchy due to the texture, so it was impressive that it went on as well as it did. The color wore well for four hours on me, and it felt slightly moisturizing.",B+
MAC,IN THE SPIRIT,Lipstick,"a dark black with cooler, purplish undertones and a satin finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage that went on evenly. The lipstick had a lightly creamy texture that wasn‚Äôt too thin or too thick, so it adhered well to the lips and felt comfortable to wear but it didn‚Äôt slide around while worn. I was able to wear the color for five hours, and the formula was neither drying nor hydrating while worn.",A-
NYX,SNOW ROSE,Highlighter,"a very light, cool-toned beige with pink-to-lavender pearl that gave it more of a soft, frosted sheen. This was one of the more interesting shades (though the type of duochrome it had is something we have seen before), as it can really alter whatever it is layered over. On its own, the whiteness of the base color is rather apparent, so on my skin tone, it would be best when layered over another blush or highlighter. For someone very fair, it could definitely be worn more on its own without looking like it lightened one‚Äôs skin. The consistency was smooth, firm but not stiff or difficult to get pigmentation out of. It applied evenly to the skin, blended out well, and didn‚Äôt emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. The highlighter wore well for eight hours before fading on me.",A-
KAT VON D,MUNECA,Lipstick,"a light-medium, peachy coral with a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which was buildable to opaque coverage if I applied two distinct layers. The consistency was thin, prone to streaking, and while I typically find that the formula self-levels while drying down, it did not with this shade. It lasted for five hours on me and faded more noticeably from the center of the mouth‚Äìa lot shorter in wear than the majority of the range. The consistency also seemed thinner and more watery to me. The formula was neither hydrating nor drying on me.",C
KAT VON D,LUDWIG,Lipstick,"a muted, medium mauve with neutral-to-warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation, though just shy of being full coverage, that applied evenly and smoothy. The consistency seemed a little thinner and more emollient than the average shade in the range, but it did not apply streaky. The liquid lipstick dried down to a flat, matte finish that didn‚Äôt emphasize my lips texture and lasted for six hours on me. It was slightly drying after five hours of wear.",A-
HOURGLASS,LIBERATOR,Lipstick,"a brighter, medium-dark berry with reddish undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that applied beautifully to the lips with smooth, even coverage. The finish was luminous without being too glossy or emollient, so the wear time wasn‚Äôt compromised, but my lips looked smoother and plumper. This shade wore well for just over five hours and left a subtle stain behind. The formula felt hydrating to my lips.",A+
HOURGLASS,WARRIOR,Lipstick,"a dark burgundy with cool undertones and a soft sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation (but it did not seem buildable beyond that), and while it applied fairly well, there was room for improvement. I felt like the amount of evenness was impressive given its emollient consistency, lightly glossy finish, and less-than full coverage pigmentation. The lipstick had a moderately emollient, smooth texture that applied with ease across the lips and was comfortable to wear, as it felt quite lightweight and was moisturizing over time. The color lasted for five hours on me and left a stain behind.",B+
MAC,CITY SLICK,Lipstick,"a light gray with neutral-to-warm undertones and a satin finish. It had good pigmentation, though not quite opaque in one layer, with a smooth, lightly creamy texture that didn‚Äôt feel too heavy or too thin on the lips. For such a light shade, it actually applied quite well without any liner, lip brush, or extra effort, but it is still a shade that would work better with a lip primer or lip liner underneath. I find that very light shades like this tend to need a liner if only to help soften the edges of the lips so they are neater. The lipstick lasted for four hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",B+
MAC,EVENING BUZZ,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark grayish lavender with cool undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that covered the lips evenly and smoothly. The consistency was a little thicker on the lips, but it had a creamy feel and applied without tugging. The formula felt lightly hydrating over the five hours it lasted for. It was a more unique color, and I‚Äôm glad it applied fairly well without much effort.",A-
MAC,MUD WRESTLER,Lipstick,"a muted, light-medium beige-brown with a hint of pink and a satin finish. It had rich pigmentation with a lightly creamy, light-medium weight texture that applied evenly but pulled away at a couple of my lip lines (it was minor, though). The formula wore nicely for five hours and was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",A-
URBAN DECAY,714,Lipstick,"a medium-dark red with warm, orange undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in one layer, but a second layer was totally doable for full coverage. It applied evenly and smoothly over the lips and sat well without emphasizing my lip lines or sinking into them. The consistency was thin and a little watery, but the application was much better than many other shades in the range for me. It lasted for six hours before fading on me, and the formula was non-drying.",B+
URBAN DECAY,TRAP QUEEN,Lipstick,"a medium-dark red with subtle, pinkish undertones and warmer gold glitter. The consistency was glittery, so it wasn‚Äôt perfectly smooth, but it wasn‚Äôt rough or uncomfortable to wear or apply. It had a lot less glitter in it compared to other Metallized shades. It had mostly opaque pigmentation, and the color applied fairly evenly to lips, though I had a few areas where the color didn‚Äôt seem as opaque as others. This shade lasted for five hours with slight flaking but the fading was fairly even. The formula felt non-drying while worn.",B
URBAN DECAY,CRIMSON,Lipstick,"a medium-dark red with neutral undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff with a smooth, slightly thinner consistency that applied evenly but was harder to control along the edges as it had a tendency to pool a bit. This shade wore well for six and a half hours, left a stain behind, and was non-drying.",B+
MAC,CRACKED EMERALD,Eyeshadow,"a vibrant, medium emerald green with subtle, warm undertones and cooler, green-teal pearl. It was smooth, creamy without being too wet, and easy to work with; the coverage was easily opaque but just as easily sheered out for a softer, sheerer look. It dried down and set, so it actually lasted for a solid nine hours on me before creasing faintly.",A
MAC,"HOLY, HOLY",Eyeshadow,"a silvery white with a metallic sheen. It had semi-sheer coverage at its best, and it could definitely be worn as a sheer wash of color, too. This was the only one of the four shades released that I couldn‚Äôt build up to opaque coverage as it seemed too emollient and prone to moving around while it was setting. It took a bit longer to dry, and if I wore it over a more lined/crease-prone area, I did get some faint creasing initially. Once it set, the color lasted for eight hours on me.",B
MAC,OVERNIGHT SENSATION,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium-dark purple with a cooler tone to it overall (although sheered out, it appeared warmer in tone). The consistency was smooth, creamy without being too slick or wet, and was easy to blend. Sheer coverage was possible, but it required using a lot less and working quickly, and I‚Äôd say it was more of a medium to opaque coverage product. It wore well for eight and a half hours before creasing.",A
MAC,WIN,Eyeshadow,"a bright, bold medium-dark blue with cool undertones and a satin sheen. It had mostly medium to opaque coverage, and if I was very careful to use the barest amount, I could get a sheer wash of color, but it was fairly pigmented. The texture was slightly more emollient than Cracked Emerald or Overnight Sensation, but it still dried down nicely and didn‚Äôt take too long to set. It lasted for eight hours on me before creasing.",A-
MAC,VIVA GLAM TARAJI P. HENSON,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable color coverage with a slightly firmer consistency in the tube. The texture was smooth, cream-like but did tug on the lips just a tad (not uncomfortably, though). On me, the color lasted for six hours, left a stain behind, and was non-drying.",A-
MAC,VIVA GLAM TARAJI P. HENSON,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and flecks of violet and pink sparkle. It had semi-opaque, slightly buildable coverage that applied evenly and smoothly to lips. The color had minimal settling into my lip lines, and the high-shine finish seemed to downplay what did appear in my lip lines. The consistency was smooth, lightly tacky but comfortable to wear over the five hours it lasted.",B+
HOURGLASS,SEEKER,Lipstick,"a bright, pop of pink with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had nearly opaque coverage, though it required two layers for truly full coverage results. The soft, emollient, and balm-like texture made application easy and comfortable to do straight from the tube, but it also made it possible to get sheerer coverage by applying less and smoothing the color out by pressing my lips together, if desired. On me, the color wore well for four and a half hours and felt moisturizing over time.",A-
HOURGLASS,ACTIVIST,Lipstick,"a soft, muted, medium-dark rosy plum with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had good color coverage that was buildable to opaque coverage in two layers. The lipstick had a smooth, lightly emollient texture that felt as comfortable as a lip balm but adhered better and didn‚Äôt feel as thick or as slippery. It wore well for four and a half hours and left my lips feeling hydrated.",A-
HOURGLASS,ACHIEVER,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark brown with a hint of plum paired with a lightly glossy sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage with two layers. It was incredibly comfortable to wear, as the texture was smooth, creamy without being heavy, and hydrating over the four and a half hours it lasted.",A
KAT VON D,OPHELIA,Lipstick,"a muted, light-medium, peachy-coral with a matte finish and warm undertones. It had good color payoff, but it wasn‚Äôt quite opaque‚ÄìI would definitely do a second coat. The consistency was thinner than the average shade in the ELL range, but it went on fairly evenly, though there were a couple of visible streaks that never quite leveled as it dried down. It lasted for six hours and faded evenly over time, and the formula was slightly drying over time.",B+
KAT VON D,SANCTUARY,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark mauve with neutral-to-cool undertones. It had good pigmentation that applied evenly and easily across the lips. The color stayed on nicely for seven hours, faded evenly, and the formula was somewhat drying after six hours of wear.",A
COLOUR POP,HI-MAINTENANCE,Eyeshadow,"four eyeshadows (that can be removed) in a slim, cardboard palette. The eyeshadows can also be purchased individually for $5 each. This palette was a miss for me, as the two matte shades were rather powdery and under-pigmented.",B-
MAC,INDIGO-GO,Lipstick,"a dark, slightly muted, navy blue with cool undertones and a soft, natural sheen. It had good pigmentation‚Äìmore pigmented than I thought based on the initial swatch‚Äìthat went on fairly evenly. The consistency had moderate slip, which made it more comfortable to wear over the five and a half hours it lasted. I had a bit of trouble getting the lipstick to adhere well to the center of my lip both times I wore it (once for photos, once for testing), but it seemed to go on fine everywhere else. This shade did stain my lips a bluish-violet after wear, while the formula was slightly hydrating overall.",A-
MAC,MATTE ROYAL,Lipstick,"a deep, bluish purple with cool undertones and a soft sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that went on fairly evenly, though there was a touch of color that settled into my deeper lip lines. The darker color made it harder to notice that, though. This shade has been released before, but the version I received for this launch was much more pigmented and had less slip on the lips. It still had a creamier texture that didn‚Äôt tug on my lips when I applied it directly from the tube, but it didn‚Äôt slide around or look as uneven applied. It wore well for six hours and left a stain behind, while the formula seemed non-drying.",A-
MAC,IN MY FASHION,Lipstick,"a blackened plum with subtle, warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had mostly opaque pigmentation that covered the lips evenly and smoothly, except the very inner portion of my lips which looked a bit patchy. The texture was smooth, lightly creamy without being too heavy or too slippery on the lips, and was comfortable to wear. The color wore nicely for five hours and was non-drying. This is a repromoted shade, and the only difference I could see was that it seemed slightly purpler overall (not quite as brown/warm) and marginally more pigmented.",B+
PHYSICIANS FORMULA,LIGHT BRONZE,Bronzer,"a light-medium brown with warm, yellow undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that was buildable to full coverage with two layers.",A-
PHYSICIANS FORMULA,BRONZE,Bronzer,"a medium brown with warm, yellow undertones and a golden, satiny sheen. This shade had more shimmer than Light Bronze, but it did not appear too shimmery on the skin. It had nearly opaque pigmentation paired with a smooth, almost cream-like texture that was easy to apply and blend out on the skin. The finish looked glowing on the skin without emphasizing my skin‚Äôs texture. It wore nicely for eight hours before fading slightly.",A
URBAN DECAY,EXTRAGALACTIC,Eyeshadow,"a dark, plummy burgundy with warm, reddish undertones and flecks of pink, copper, and plum sparkle. The Moondust formula is supposed to have ‚Äúminimal fallout‚Äù that ‚Äúfeels like a cream, but goes on like a powder.‚Äù They can be used wet for ‚Äúextra intense color payout.‚Äù The eyeshadow had mostly opaque dry and totally opaque coverage applied damp, but the big difference was in how much smoother the powder applied with a damp brush. It had a fairly soft texture, though there was quite a bit of sparkle to it, so I could feel that by touch (not rough‚Ä¶ just sparkly). It applied decently to bare skin but is a shade I‚Äôd apply over a glitter adhesive or with a damp brush to minimize fallout and improve the overall longevity of the product (six and a half hours dry, eight hours damp with some fallout either way).",B
URBAN DECAY,MIDNIGHT BLAST,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, coppery brown with warm undertones and a sparkling finish. It had opaque pigmentation both dry and damp but the metallic and glittery finish came through more intensely when applied damp. The powder also combined and adhered better to bare skin when applied with a damp brush, though it was quite workable even dry (better than many shades in the formula). It blended out easily without having a ton of fallout. This shade wore well for seven and a half hours dry and eight hours damp with minimal fallout.",B+
NYX,TWILIGHT TINT,Highlighter,"cool, bluish white with an iridescent blue-to-violet sheen. The finish was somewhere between luminous and frost; slightly visible shimmer but once blended and buffed into the skin, the finish appeared more like a very smooth, luminous sheen. It had a moderately dense texture‚Äìthe kind that has a very smooth feel with zero dustiness or powderiness to it but wasn‚Äôt actually stiff or difficult to work with. It had nearly opaque coverage, though I felt like it was easy to control and use with a lighter hand (or a different tool) to get semi-sheer to medium coverage, if desired. This type of shade can work exceptionally well layered over other products, especially to add a cooler, bluer tone to them, while also highlighting an area. When I tested this for wear, the highlighter wore well for eight hours on me.",A-
URBAN DECAY,1985,Eyeshadow,"a brighter, medium-dark magenta purple with pink undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which was buildable to opaque coverage with a heavier hand or two layers patted on (not swept). The texture was firmer in the pan and a bit drier overall, though I had no issues blending and diffusing the shade on the lid. On me, the color lasted for just over eight hours before fading noticeably.",B+
URBAN DECAY,BLITZ,Eyeshadow,"a brilliant gold with subtle, warm undertones and a metallic sheen with subtle, gold micro-glitter. As far as gold can go, it wasn‚Äôt as warm-toned as a lot of Urban Decay golds, as it was less orange and more yellow in its base. The eyeshadow had a very smooth, blendable texture that was dense enough that it felt cream-like but worked and applied like a powder still. It had rich, opaque color coverage that lasted for eight hours on me. I did have a bit of fallout from the micro-glitter, though. This shade is exclusive to Urban Decay‚Äôs website.",A-
URBAN DECAY,C-NOTE,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium green with neutral-to-cool undertones paired with a metallic finish. The more I blended out the eyesahdow, the more yellow the undertone appeared, but the reflective sheen seemed almost cool-toned at times. I found that it looked cooler when paired with cooler eyeshadows (blues) than warmer ones (golds). The pigmentation was fantastic, while the texture was soft, a little looser in the pan so it had a touch of fallout during application if I wasn‚Äôt careful, but it was blendable and fairly easy to use. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.",A-
URBAN DECAY,THUNDERBIRD,Eyeshadow,"a deep brown with a smoldering, black base and a metallic finish. It was intensely pigmented and yielded full coverage with the barest touch of a brush. The consistency was smooth, dense without being too firm in the pan but had no fallout during application. It blended out easily on my lid and lasted for eight and a half hours on me.",A
URBAN DECAY,SMOKEOUT,Eyeshadow,"a deep, purple-leaning taupe with hints of brown in the underneath‚Äìthe single version appeared deeper and cooler overall compared to the last time I tried it (in a palette). It had a smooth, blendable texture that wasn‚Äôt too soft or too firm in the pan. The pigmentation was incredible, and the eyeshadow wore well for eight hours before fading on me.",A-
URBAN DECAY,BLONDE,Eyeshadow,"a light ivory with warm, yellowish undertones and a gold-to-pink shift in its pearly sheen. It had good color coverage with a soft, lightly dusty texture that applied without any trouble at all, but it could look a little dry on my lids at times (which are a bit drier at the moment). I noticed signs of fading after seven and a half hours of wear.",B+
URBAN DECAY,VICE,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark purple with cooler undertones and a pearly sheen. The texture was slightly drier, so the edges didn‚Äôt look as seamless or as diffused when blended without some extra effort (but totally doable). It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that lasted for just over seven and a half hours on me.",B
HOURGLASS,PEACEMAKER,Lipstick,"muted, medium pinky brown with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable coverage that covered the lips with smooth, even color. The consistency was lightweight, emollient without being too thick or slippery on the lips. This shade wore well for three and a half hours and was hydrating over time.",A-
HOURGLASS,IDEALIST,Lipstick,"a medium, peachy brown with warm undertones and a soft, glossy sheen. It had medium, buildable coverage that applied fairly evenly. There was a little bit of streaking with this shade, which may have been due to the more slippery consistency. There was some color that settled into my lip lines noticeably after two hours of wear. On me, the lipstick lasted for three hours before needing a touch-up, though the formula was comfortable and moisturizing to wear.",B-
HOURGLASS,FUTURIST,Lipstick,"a soft, rosy brown with warm undertones and a lightly glossy finish. It had medium coverage, which was buildable to semi-opaque but not to full coverage (the majority of this range has been buildable to full coverage). The texture was creamy, moderately emollient with noticeable slip, and comfortable to apply and to wear. I noticed some color pulled into my lip lines, and the color did not seem to go on as evenly as other shades. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs something one would see from a normal viewing distance, but compared to a lot of the other shades in the range, it just wasn‚Äôt as impressive. It wore well for three hours and was hydrating.",B
CHANEL,CAMELIA DE CHANEL,Highlighter,"a light, golden beige with warm undertones and a soft, sparkling sheen. There was both finer, more luminous shimmer and slightly larger, more noticeable sparkles in this product.",B+
BURBERRY,SILK AND BLOOM,Palette,"a soft, medium-dark plum with subtle, warm undertones and cooler, violet and pink shimmer. The finish had a noticeable sheen, though it did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture or the look of my pores.",A
NYX,SYNTHETICA,Highlighter,"a pop of orange with warm, red undertones and a gold, frosted finish. It had good color coverage‚Äìnot quite full coverage but close‚Äìwith a smooth, silky consistency that was denser and firmer in the pan. It blended out easily on the skin, but I would recommend using a denser brush or using a heavier hand to get product onto the brush. I didn‚Äôt feel like the powder was stiff, but it wasn‚Äôt as loosely pressed as a lot of highlighters on the market, which did make it easier to control and build coverage and sheen up. This should work well for highlighting on darker skin tones and act more as a highlighting blush on lighter complexions. On me, the highlighter lasted for eight hours before fading.",A-
LANCOME,CRYSTALLIZED COBALT (10),Lipgloss,"a bright, medium blue with lighter blue and silver pearl. It appeared brighter swatched than on the lips, as it ended up being semi-sheer and sort of turned my lips into a ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been eating a blue popsicle‚Äù kind of color. While the gloss had greater density and was thicker, it managed to find its way into every lip line on my lips. On top of that, the color did not apply evenly and looked horrendous. The color lasted for five hours and was hydrating, so I guess all wasn‚Äôt lost. I give credit to Lancome for doing a blue gloss in the first place, and it was translucent, but if it‚Äôs going to look this terrible, I‚Äôm not sure you‚Äôre really doing your brand any favors.",F
LANCOME,BRUSHED GOLD (11),Lipgloss,"a medium gold with warm, coppery undertones and a glossy, metallic finish. It had good pigmentation‚Äìone of the more pigmented shades in the range‚Äìthat covered evenly and lasted for six hours. The formula was thicker, denser, and tacky, but it was still smooth and comfortable to wear. It was also hydrating while worn.",A-
LANCOME,IRON NUDE (12),Lipgloss,"a muted, meidum-dark copper-brown with warm, reddish undertones and multi-colored pearl. It had semi-opaque color payoff, and it applied evenly and smoothly. I think this was one of the better shades in the range, as long as opaque coverage wasn‚Äôt a must-have. The texture was tacky, smooth, and medium in weight, but it lasted for five and a half hours and was moisturizing.",A-
LANCOME,MOLTEN MAGENTA (13),Lipgloss,"a deep plum with subtle, warm undertones and cooler, violet and ruby red pearl. It had medium coverage, and the shimmer seemed to disappear when applied to the lips‚Äìit was much less impactful compared to all of the other shades in the range. It applied evenly, but a lot of the color slipped into my lip lines and made them appear darker. The texture was noticeably tacky, thicker than average, but it felt smooth and spread easily across the lips. On me, the gloss lasted for five and a half hours and was hydrating over time.",B-
HOURGLASS,LEADER,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark fuchsia pink with subtle, cool undertones and a soft sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable color payoff that covered the lips with even, smooth color. The texture was creamy, thin without being clingy or emphasizing, and softened the look of my lip lines. This shade did not seem quite as hydrating as others in the line, though it was still lightly moisturizing over the four and a half hours it lasted. It also left a subtle stain behind.",A
HOURGLASS,LOVER,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark orange with warm, red undertones and a creamy, lightly glossy finish. It had mostly opaque, buildable coverage paired with a creamy, smooth, balm-like texture that applied even coverage to the lips. There were slight ‚Äúlines‚Äù visible when I pressed my lips together, as the formula had more slip. It was incredibly comfortable to wear, hydrating, and longer wearing at five hours.",A-
HOURGLASS,INNOVATOR,Lipstick,"a medium-dark brick red with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, though the creamier, lightly balmy consistency would make it possible to apply less and still achieve even, sheerer coverage. The lip crayon had a creamy, lightweight, and comfortable feel on the lips, which also seemed to hydrate my lips over the five hours it lasted.",A
BURBERRY,OXBLOOD (53),Lipstick,"a deep, subdued plum with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had intense, full color coverage that applied smoothly and evenly. The liquid lipstick had a velvety, mousse-like texture that was airy and lightweight on the lips. The color spread easily across the lips, lasted for eight hours, and was non-drying over time.",A+
BURBERRY,BLACK CHERRY (57),Lipstick,"dark, subdued burgundy with hints of warm, brown paired with a cream finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage, which applied decently but could have been more even. The texture felt a little thinner and had more slip than most shades in the range, though it was still thicker than most liquid lipstick formulations. The color stayed on well for six and a half hours, left a subtle pinkish stain behind, and was non-drying.",B
MAYBELLINE,BEIGE BABE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium pinky-coral with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage that did not apply particularly well; despite the texture feeling creamy and gliding across the lips without tugging, the color separated and caught on every flake and imperfection I had. It wore poorly, as the color moved around, migrated into lip lines, and turned patchy within two hours of wear. I think the only way to make it workable is mixed with a little bit of balm (which doesn‚Äôt help the settling but improves the drier appearance) or use over a lip liner.",C
MAYBELLINE,HONEY PINK,Lipstick,"a brighter, medium-dark pink-coral with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good pigmentation, though not quite opaque, that covered evenly. The lipstick felt creamy, comfortable to wear, and applied without pulling on the lips, but again, it just looked drier and pulled away at my lip lines. The color lasted well for three hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B-
MAYBELLINE,NAKED CORAL,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark pink-coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. The consistency felt more emollient than the majority of shades in the Inti-Matte range, and it did not appear as dry on the lips as a result, though I still had some issues with color pulling into my lip lines. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that went on evenly and lasted for four hours. The formula felt just a touch hydrating overall.",B
MAYBELLINE,RAW CHOCOLATE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark rosy brown with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that covered the lips with smooth, even coverage. The lipstick felt lightly creamy‚Äìenough creaminess to glide on but not slide around over time‚Äìand felt and looked more hydrating. This shade wore well for four and a half hours with a bit of color settling into lip lines, and it was slightly moisturizing over time.",A-
MAC,THE SHINING HOUR,Palette,"four sparkling eyeshadows in shades of white, gold, peach, and brown. The Dazzleshadow formula is supposed to be very sparkly with a ‚Äú3D effect‚Äù with ‚Äústay-true‚Äù adhesion that has ‚Äúminimal fallout.‚Äù They‚Äôre fun and sparkly, but they perform best as sheer washes of sparkle, patted over a more pigmented product, or applied over a glitter adhesive. They are pretty dismal on their own‚Äìsheerer, drier, fallout-prone, and short wearing‚Äìand are improved when applied damp‚Äìbetter pigmentation, smoother coverage, less fallout‚Äìbut still have their share of problems without more help (tacky base, layered over a more pigmented eyeshadow, etc.). I noticed that the eyeshadows in the quad seemed to be drier and looser in the pan compared to the singles I‚Äôve tried in the past.",D
URBAN DECAY,AMULET,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark rosy plum with subtle, warm undertones and a metallic, ‚Äúmatte‚Äù finish. There was a sheen, but there was still the illusion of a more matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in one layer, and it could be made opaque with a second coat. The consistency was smooth, thin without being watery, and covered very evenly and smoothly. This one was one of the better shades for coverage and application, but it never, ever fully dried down. It took about three minutes for it to mostly dry down, but it remained a little tacky and began breaking down after four and a half hours of wear. The formula was non-drying on me.",B
URBAN DECAY,STUDDED,Lipstick,"a dirty, greenish pewter with olive undertones and a metallic-matte finish. While the color is undeniably cool and unique, the application was terrible. It was patchy and uneven, as the pigmentation was lacking and the texture was watery and hard to control. A second layer made it look marginally better, but unfortunately, it still had patchiness and unevenness. The lipstick started to flake away from the edges of the lips within a few hours, and the total wear was about five hours. The formula was non-drying on me.",D-
URBAN DECAY,CONSPIRACY,Lipstick,"a deep, burgundy brown with cool undertones and gold sparkle. It had medium coverage, which applied decently but there were some areas with unevenness despite trying to apply the color very, very carefully. The consistency has a noticeable texture from the amount of sparkle, though it did not feel rough or uncomfortable to me. The sparkle sat more on top of the color, so it was more impactful. The texture was slightly watery, which may have accounted for the more uneven application and the amount of color that sunk into my lip lines. It lasted for five hours before there was noticeable fading and some flaking, though it was non-drying.",C
MAC,ICE FOLLIES,Lipgloss,"a sheer, golden base with pink and blue pearl. This particular shade was described as sheer, though it was so sheer that I‚Äôd consider it more like translucent with sheer pearl coverage.",B+
MAC,IT'S A GREAT FEELING,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark copper with warm undertones and flecks of fine red pearl. MAC described it as ‚Äútransparent‚Äù (I feel like ‚Äúsheer‚Äù would have worked better with this shade whereas ‚Äútransparent‚Äù would have made more sense for Ice Follies!), and I would describe the coverage as sheer to semi-sheer. It noticeably tinted my lips to warmer, reddish hue but let my natural lip color come through. There was visible pearl that distributed evenly across my lips. The consistency was smooth, jelly-like, and non-sticky, which made it a real treat to wear, as it was hydrating and comfortable on the lips. It lasted for two and a half hours on me.",B
MAC,MOONS OF SATURN,Palette,"two Cream Colour Bases and one Sculpting Powder. The Cream Colour Base formula is supposed to have sheer, buildable coverage with a dewy finish that lasts for ‚Äúeight hours on face and body‚Äù and has ‚Äúlasting wear for hours on eyes. I tend to prefer Cream Colour Bases on cheeks for better wear and application, but for use on eyes, they‚Äôre best used as an all-over wash of color or on the brow bone to add shine. I think this particular kit worked well together, though I‚Äôm expecting that the more orange-toned powder to be less-than-ideal for many as it is very warm and orange.",B
HOURGLASS,ICON,Lipstick,"a bold, medium-dark red with cool, pink undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque, buildable color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly. It had a creamy, thin (but not too thin!) texture that glided across the lips nicely but didn‚Äôt melt too much that it was hard to be precise. The soft sheen and creamier consistency made it appear almost like a lip stain. The color lasted for five hours, was hydrating, and very comfortable to wear.",A+
HOURGLASS,VISIONARY,Lipstick,"a deep, coppery red with warm undertones and a soft sheen. It had medium, buildable coverage‚Äìup to nearly opaque coverage‚Äìpaired with a creamy, glide-on texture that was thin, lightweight, and comfortable to wear. The color went on evenly, an I didn‚Äôt have issues with the color lingering in my lip lines over time. This shade wore nicely for five hours and left a subtle, reddish stain behind.",A
HOURGLASS,PROTECTOR,Lipstick,"a medium-dark berry with hints of magenta and a natural sheen. The finish was glossy enough to make my lips appear smoother but didn‚Äôt actually feel slippery or slide around while worn. The consistency was lightly creamy, adhered well to the lips without being clingy, and applied evenly. It had semi-opaque, buildable coverage that lasted for five hours, left a stain behind, and was hydrating.",A+
BURBERRY,PEACH (25),Lipstick,"light-medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a creamy finish. It had rich color payoff, but it did not apply quite as evenly as the majority of the shades in the formula did. There was also more color that gathered in my lip lines, even from the initial application, that only worsened over time. The texture was creamy with moderate slip but still a more mousse-like consistency overall. The color lasted for five hours on me and was non-drying and comfortable on the lips.",B-
BURBERRY,REGIMENT RED (37),Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark orange-red with warm undertones and a lightly glossy, cream finish. The color coverage was nearly opaque, while it had a smooth, spreadable consistency that was airy, lightweight, but still covered evenly. There was a touch of color that pulled into my deepest lip lines, but it was hard to notice from a normal viewing distaince (e.g. not in a macro photo!). It lasted for seven hours, was comfortable to wear as it was non-drying, and left a stain behind.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,COUGAR,Lipstick,"bright, medium-dark plum with cooler undertones an a matte finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff with a velvety, smooth texture that spread well across the lips. The color did not gather in my lip lines and looked fairly flattering (at least, compared to most shades in the range). On me, the lipstick wore well for five hours, left a stain behind, and was moderately drying.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,WILD CHILD,Lipstick,"bright, cobalt blue with cool undertones and a cream finish. The color payoff was incredibly rich and opaque, but the formula itself did not seem to sit as well on the lips as I would have expected. The texture had a creamy, velvety feel to it‚Äìvery smooth‚Äìand applied with ease, but it appeared ‚Äúcracked‚Äù when I smiled as the color separated at my lip lines. The color lasted for four and a half hours, left a fuchsia stain behind, and was somewhat drying.",B-
MAKEUP GEEK,ROCKER CHICK,Lipstick,"a deep berry with cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. The consistency was drier, almost chalky in a way, and did not spread evenly at all. The color went on unevenly, and there little bits of color that balled up and looked like crumbles on my lips. The lipstick also settled into my lip lines over time. This shade lasted for five hours, left a strong stain behind, and was very drying (my lips started to peel afterward). I had to take a break from testing all shades from the formula after I wore this one.",D+
URBAN DECAY,DISTURBED,Lipstick,"a deep, burgundy with subtle, warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had medium coverage, which was somewhat buildable, that applied decently but could have went on more evenly. The formula was thinner, a little watery, so it was harder to control-especially around the edges‚Äìand it didn‚Äôt self-level as it dried down, so any streaking became magnified as it dried down. It took about two to three minutes to dry down, and it remained lightly tacky for an hour (though it stopped lifting color after three minutes). It lasted for six hours and was non-drying.",C-
URBAN DECAY,RAPTURE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark plum with neutral-to-cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in one layer, and it was buildable to opaque coverage with two layers‚Äìbut it took five minutes to dry with two coats (three minutes with one coat), and if I touched my lips together at all during that time, the color pulled away from my lips, leaving a patchy mess that had to be fully removed and redone. Urban Decay does specifically say not to press lips together while it‚Äôs drying, but the long dry down time makes that a lot more annoying. It felt comfortable, featherweight, and was nondrying for the six hours it lasted.",B-
URBAN DECAY,ZZ,Lipstick,"a bright, medium purple with warm, magenta undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that went on decently but looked slightly patchy in places. This shade also seemed to cling more and emphasize the natural texture and lines on my lips after it dried down, though it did not look ‚Äúcracked‚Äù due to the thinner formula. The color faded somewhat unevenly from the center of the mouth, and it lasted for six and a half hours before it had faded to the point of needing to be reapplied/removed. I could reapply the color on top of it without fully removing, but if there was a lot of patchiness, the lack of opacity in the color itself did me no favors (use two coats!).",C+
MAC,THE BEST OF EVERYTHING,Palette,"a new, limited edition smoky palette. I love the color concept, and the four shades complement each other well, but I wasn‚Äôt thrilled with the performance of two shades (one was incredibly disappointing!).",B-
MAYBELLINE,HOT SAND,Lipstick,"a light-medium peach with warm, pale orange undertones and a satin finish. It had good pigmentation, but the consistency was chalk-like in that it appeared drier, almost crumbly on the lips and separated at my lip lines (like a matte, liquid lipstick might after drying down), despite the actual texture feeling very creamy with moderate slip. I think that if worn with a liner, it would look more flattering on. It lasted for three hours on me, but it had severely separated over time. The formula was lightly hydrating overall.",C+
MAYBELLINE,PURELY NUDE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium pinky beige with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. The coverage was nearly opaque, while the texture felt creamy, glided on and never tugged, but it had a drier, more grainular look on the lips (though it didn‚Äôt feel like actual grains on my lips). The color lasted for three hours with noticeable color that had settled into my lip lines after two hours of wear. I‚Äôd highly recommend using a lip primer or lip liner underneath this one.",C-
MAYBELLINE,PEACH BUFF,Lipstick,"a soft, medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that went on fairly evnely, though I had a bit of patchiness along the outer edges of my lips. The lipstick had a lightly creamy texture that didn‚Äôt feel dry and glided on without tugging, but I felt like the end result looked a little dry and more prone to emphasizing the texture of my lips overall. It wore well for four hours and only had some color pull into lines over time (it was the best of the three in this review!).",B
MAC,CHOCOTEASE,Lipstick,"a deep brown with warm, reddish undertones and a matte finish. It was nearly full coverage, but there was a little translucency where a second layer (or just a partial layer in some places) would be a good idea. The texture was thin but not watery, spread well and dried down well. The lipstick wore well for just over seven hours on me, and it started to feel drying after four hours of wear.",B+
MAC,CARNIVOROUS,Lipstick,"a deep red with subtle, cool undertones paired with a mostly matte finish. This shade took longer to dry down than most in the range, and the final dry down was more semi-matte than flat matte as well (though it wore down to a flat matte finish after two hours of wear). The consistency was thin, a little watery, but it managed to apply evenly and smoothly across the lips. It had mostly opaque color coverage that lasted for eight hours on me. This shade left a stain behind, and it was drying after four hours of wear.",B+
MAC,OH LADY,Lipstick,"a deep berry with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff with a thin consistency that spread fairly well across the lips and did not appear streaky or uneven as it dried down. I found that the color did dry deeper in my lip lines, so not only did it appear a little ‚Äúcracked‚Äù after the dry down, it emphasized my lines further by making them darker. This shade lasted for eight hours but was drying over time.",B+
KAT VON D,PASTEL GOTH,Palette,"eight matte eyeshadows with six pops of color and then a dark gray and stark white. The formula felt very velvety, finely-milled, and was blendable on the skin, but each shade had a fair amount of excessive powder that kicked up in the pan. The strange thing was that there was little fallout; I used seven of the eight shades in the look demoed above, and I didn‚Äôt have to cleanup at all underneath the eye. The pigmentation was decent to good, but I did find it worked best patted on, rather than swept on, for best results.",B
GUERLAIN,HAPPY GLOW PEARLS,Highlighter,"a soft, pink-tinted white base with fine pink, gold, and lavender sparkle over a semi-matte finish. The Meteorites Pearls formula is supposed to ‚Äúdelicately color-correct and illuminate the complexion‚Äù with the brand‚Äôs typical violet fragrance.",B
BURBERRY,PRIMROSE (21),Lipstick,"a brighter, medium peony pink with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque coverage in one layer, while the consistency was spreadable, velvety, mousse-like, and lightweight on the lips. This shade lasted for five and a half hours on me but some color pulled into lip lines after three and a half hours of wear. I was able to rub my lips together to smooth the color back out, though. The formula was comfortable to wear and non-drying.",B
BURBERRY,MAGENTA (33),Lipstick,"a bold, bright, medium-dark fuchsia-red with a lightly glossy shine and warmer undertones. The color payoff was quite good‚Äìalmost opaque‚Äìand applied evenly, but the texture had more slip and sank into my lip lines from the get-go. The bolder, brighter color made it harder to detect at a normal viewing distance, but you can see the color in my lip lines in the close-up photo. The color lasted for eight hours, left a stain behind, and never felt drying.",B+
MAC,SIMPLY SMOKED,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark taupe brown with neutral-to-cool undertones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque coverage, though I would recommend a second layer or a lip liner for full opacity. The consistency was thinner than it should have been, as it did not apply as evenly as the best shades in the range have (but it was not the worst and looked decent after it dried down). On me, the lipstick wore well for six and a half hours, while the formula was somewhat drying.",B
MAC,ESSPRESSO,Lipstick,"a dark brown with cool undertones and a matte finish. It ha good color payoff‚Äìalmost opaque in one layer‚Äìthat spread evenly across the lips for smooth coverage. It dried down to a totally flat, matte finish that was fairly smooth but there was a bit of color separation at the center of my bottom lip (my deepest lip line). It lasted for seven hours, faded evenly, and was drying over time.",B+
MAC,LADY BE GOOD,Lipstick,"a muted, peachy-coral with warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. This shade took longer to dry down, and it did not dry down to a totally flat, matte finish like the majority of the shades in the range did. The consistency was more watery, so application was difficult: streaky and uneven. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, but this was definitely a shade where a second layer would be a necessity. It lasted for five and a half hours and was drying over time.",C
BURBERRY,BRIGHT CRIMSON,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation with a smooth, cream-mousse hybrid consistency that was easy to spread across the lips. Initially, it seemed more white-based and almost chalky, but after a few minutes, it seemed to transform and looked smooth, even, and lush on the lips. The color wore well for six and a half hours, left a stain behind, and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
BURBERRY,MILITARY RED,Lipstick,"a vibrant, medium red with neutral undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque color payoff with a smooth, even coverage. The consistency was velvety, mousse-like but still a little more emollient than other shades in the range (it even appeared glossier after applied). There was a bit of color that pulled into my lip lines, but it was bright enough that it was hard to notice from a normal viewing distance. This shade wore well for seven and a half hours and left a stain behind. It was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
MAC,TODAY WE LIVE,Palette,"a soft, coral blush paired with a medium, taupe-brown. It‚Äôs a decent product, but the taupe-brown could be easier to work with. This is part of the MAC Makeup Art Cosmetics collection in collaboration with Kabuki, which will be available online on January 19th.",B
MAC,DEARLY BELOVED,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark rosy brown with neutral-to-warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had good color coverage with a smooth, lightly creamy consistency that glided across the lips without tugging. The lipstick wore well for five hours, was neither drying nor hydrating, and comfortable to wear.",A-
MAC,THUNDER KISS,Lipgloss,"a deep, reddish brown with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a lightweight, creamy consistency that spread easily but, unfortunately, did not apply that evenly. The gloss had a tendency to settle into my lip lines, and the color itself was never quite even. On me, the product lasted for five hours and was lightly hydrating while worn. I would recommend layering this over another product or using a lip liner underneath it to help improve its appearance.",C+
VISEART,WARM MATTES (10),Palette,"an unabashedly warm-toned palette filled with a mix of beige, brown, orange, and red. There are a lot of yellow and orange-based shades here. The palette worked well on its own, but it was easy to incorporate with other Viseart palettes as well. Overall, the quality was consistent with my past experience with Viseart‚Äôs matte formula‚Äìpigmented, long-wearing, and blendable.",A
MAKEUP GEEK,TOMBOY,Lipstick,"a muted, purpled plum with warmer undertones and a cream finish. The pigmentation was fantastic, and the lipstick had a smooth, creamy texture that applied beautifully to the lips. This was one of the few shades that actually looked flattering on as it did not appear ‚Äúcracked‚Äù when I smiled. It spread easily across the lips, and while it felt comfortable on, the formula itself still seemed drying, as my lips felt raw after wearing it. This shade wore well for five hours and did leave a stain behind.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,SMARTY PANTS,Lipstick,"a bright, medium coral-orange with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had rich, opaque color coverage that had a very velvety, smooth, and creamy texture that was easy to spread across the lips, but it just seemed to separate wherever I had lip lines. The formula felt so good initially, but I could not get the texture to look flattering on lips, no matter whether I exfoliated my lips or used balm beforehand. The color lasted for four and a half hours, left a stain behind, and was drying after I removed it.",C+
MAKEUP GEEK,CHATTERBOX,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was great, but it just did not apply as evenly as it should have. Even though the lipstick has a smooth, velvety feel on the lips, it had a tendency to catch and highlight every imperfection on my lips, settle into lip lines, and make my lips look drier even though the formula was not clingy nor did it dry down to a matte finish. The color lasted for three and a half hours before it had turned so patchy that it really needed a reapplication. It did not seem drying while I wore it, but my lips felt terrible a few hours later.",B-
VISEART,PETIT PRO (01),Palette,"a miniature-sized, slim palette. This would be a good way to try the Viseart formula without breaking the bank; there is plenty of product in each pan, and each shade is quite pigmented so you‚Äôll be able to get plenty of use out of it. The matte eyeshadows blended and layered well with the denser, more shimmery eyeshadows. The shimmery eyeshadows felt smoother and more cream-like compared to past shimmer finishes from the brand. Overall, it‚Äôs a nice palette if you don‚Äôt have these types of shades in your arsenal already.",A
DIOR,#003,Highlighter,"medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. Of the four shades in the range, this one had more noticeble shimmer and sheen on the skin, and it emphasized my skin‚Äôs natural texture a bit even at medium coverage. It had opaque color coverage in a single layer, which was easy to blend out and diffuse for a softer effect. On me, the highlighter wore well for eight hours before fading.",A-
MAC,UNIFORMLY FABULOUS,Lipstick,"a blackened purple with warmer undertones and a matte finish. It had good color payoff, though it was not opaque, in a single layer. The texture was smooth, thinner but not watery, and spread easily across the lips for even coverage. It dried down and did not appear ‚Äúcracked‚Äù when I smiled. This shade wore well for eight hours but was drying.",A
MAC,YOUNG ATTITUDE,Lipstick,"a deep, bluish teal with cool undertones and a mostly matte finish. The formula was thin and a little watery, so the color did not apply as evenly as a lot of the shades from the range have. It had a tendency to appear a little streaky with some areas appearing darker than others. It had semi-opaque coverage, and a second layer would be doable without causing texture/wear issues later on. This shade lasted for seven hours but faded more noticeably from the center of the mouth, while the formula was drying. It did leave a bluish stain behind.",C+
LANCOME,POLISHED ROSE (01),Lipgloss,"a medium rosy pink with cooler undertones and warmer gold and pink pearl. It had medium, somewhat buildable coverage with a very glossy finish. The consistency was light-medium in thickness, tacky, and did not leave ‚Äúlines‚Äù if I pressed my lips together. I did have a bit of the pinker base settle into my lip lines, though. The gloss lasted for five hours and was hydrating over time.",C+
LANCOME,LAVENDER PATINA (02),Lipgloss,"a muted, medium mauve with multi-colored pearl and cool undertones. It had semi-opaque color payoff with a fairly smooth, even application with a lot of noticeable shimmer. The consistency was light-medium in weight, definitely tacky but very smooth. The finish was incredibly glossy and shiny to the point that it looked wet. It wore for just over five hours on me, and the formula was comfortable and moisturizing.",B+
LANCOME,ORANGE ORE (03),Lipgloss,"a bright, medium tangerine orange with warm undertonews and fine, gold pearl. It had good pigmentation‚Äìnot quite opaque‚Äìthat covered the lips evenly. However, this one settled into my lip lines in a major way! The gloss was tacky, light-medium in weight, and comfortable to wear, as it was hydrating. It lasted well for six hours on me.",B
COLOUR POP,HACK,Lipgloss,"a light-medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and pink glitter. The brand described the coverage as sheer, and I would describe it as sheer to semi-sheer coverage. The gloss was non-sticky, lightweight, and smooth on the lips, which made it comfortable to wear, but I did notice color had settled into my lip lines, despite the gloss applying evenly otherwise. It lasted for three hours on me and was hydrating.",B
COLOUR POP,JIFFY,Lipstick,"a muted, medium pink with neutral undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had rich, opaque color payoff that applied evenly. The texture was thin but very pigmented, so it spread easily and ‚Äúdried down‚Äù to a semi-matte finish. This shade dried down more than most of the Ultra Satins have in the past, and the color had a tendency to pull apart along my deeper lip lines. The lipstick lasted for five and a half hours on me, and it was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
COLOUR POP,CHAPS,Lipstick,"a deep purple with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. While it is an Ultra Matte, it had an extraordinarily long dry down (a few minutes) and still had some sheen to it, which eventually wore down after a few hours of wear. The consistency was thin but richer in coverage and has more substance to it, and it yielded opaque, even coverage. I did have slight ‚Äúcracking‚Äù when I smiled, though. The lipstick stayed on nicely for six hours before starting to break down, and it was somewhat drying after four hours of wear.",A-
DIOR,#002,Highlighter,"a soft, light pink with warmer undertones and a metallic sheen. It was intensely pigmented‚Äìyou really do not need much to obtain a noticeable glow!‚Äìwith a smooth, blendable consistency that wasn‚Äôt powder or dusty at all. It was incredibly easy to apply, and while it the finish was nearly metallic, it did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs texture unless applied very heavily. The highlighter lasted for eight hours before fading on me.",A
MAKEUP GEEK,DAREDEVIL,Lipstick,"a bright, medium purple with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentatin one layer, but it would be buildable to opaque coverage with two layers (the consistency would get slippery, though). The texture felt very smooth, velvety, and spread across the lips with ease, but it did my lip lines no favors and appeared ‚Äúcracked‚Äù around them. This shade lasted for four and a half hours, left a fuchsia stain behind, and did not feel drying while worn.",B-
MAKEUP GEEK,PARTY GIRL,Lipstick,"medium-dark purple with warm, pink undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage with a very grainy consistency that added a layer of texture to my lips along with color that settled in some lip lines. The texture was thicker, and while it spread without problems, it felt odd to wear, like the consistency was poorly mixed to begin with. The color lasted for four hours, left a stain behind, and was drying after I removed it.",D+
MAKEUP GEEK,BACHELORETTE,Lipstick,"bright, neon fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. It had rich, opaque color coverage with a very smooth, velvety texture that didn‚Äôt feel heavy on the lips. The downside was that the color separated around lip lines, giving the illusion of ‚Äúcracked‚Äù lips, even though it was not a formula that dries down to a matte finish (it remains movable with some slip). On me, the color lasted for six hours, left a pinky-red stain behind, and while it didn‚Äôt feel drying on, my lips felt really raw shortly after removing it.",B+
COLOUR POP,STEELE,Eyeshadow,"a very pale pink with lavender and silver glitter. It had semi-sheer coverage, which was not buildable, and the consistency felt drier than average so it did not blend out as easily. I had the best luck using my fingertip to blend out the color (I think the warmth of my skin helped). The color lasted for nine hours before creasing subtly.",C
COLOUR POP,IGNITION,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium lavender with silvery sparkle. It had good color payoff with a fairly smooth texture, though mine plopped out when I opened it (note to self: do not open upside down!) and broke apart‚Äìit was still malleable and could be pushed back together, but only to a degree. I think it was still drier than most Super Shock Shadows, though, which might have been what caused it to lift away from the interior pan. It did not blend out as easily for me as other shades have in the past. It lasted for ten hours with minimal fall out.",A-
COLOUR POP,HYDROPLANE,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark blue-teal with pink and silver sparkle over a pearl finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage, which I did not find to be that buildable; in fact, the more emollient texture made it more prone to sheering out and looking patchy on the lid. I normally have no problems applying and working with the formula using brushes (flat, firm, synthetic ones!), this one puzzled me‚Äìand I did try using my fingertip, too, but it just didn‚Äôt go on very well. Though it did not look good on, the formula was still very long-wearing at ten hours of wear.",C+
BURBERRY,BRILLIANT VIOLET,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark berry plum with cooler undertones and a cream finish. It had rich, opaque color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. The texture was ultra lightweight with a more whipped, mousse-like consistency that spread easily and did not look streaky. Though it did not have a ‚Äúdry down‚Äù like some liquid lipsticks, it was still long-wearing at nearly eight hours (plus a fuchsia stain was left behind) and started to look mostly matte after four to five hours of wear. The formula was comfortable to wear, as I often forgot I even had it on, and it wasn‚Äôt drying at all.",A+
BURBERRY,BRIGHT PLUM,Lipstick,"deep, reddish plum with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. It had a smooth, velvety consistency that felt more like a mousse but was still very spreadable and lightweight on the lips. The coverage was opaque, while the color lasted for eight hours on me. The formula was comfortable to wear and neither drying nor hydrating while worn.",A+
URBAN DECAY,NOCTURNAL,Palette,"twelve eyeshadows in a slim, cardboard palette with a dual-ended eye brush. The shades include ‚Äúeight must-haves‚Äù from the permanent line along with ‚Äúfour exclusives from past sets.‚Äù I liked the palette overall; it was more consistent with the brand‚Äôs permanent range with respect to quality, though shades like Fireball (not as pigmented as the permanent version), Midnight Cowboy Rides Again (glitter fallout), and Heroine (sheer) could be better. The eyeshadows were, overall, pigmented, long-wearing (seven to eight hours), and blendable. It wasn‚Äôt hard to use them together, and I didn‚Äôt feel like it was a struggle to apply and blend them out.",B
URBAN DECAY,FIREBALL,Lipstick,"a soft, tangerine orange with iridescent pink pearl. It‚Äôs listed as a ‚ÄúMetallized‚Äù finish, but it seemed more like a Sheer Shimmer to me. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque, buildable coverage with a lightweight, thinner texture that had noticeable slip. The color gravitated towards my lip lines, as it seemed thinner and lacked some of the gel-like quality of other shades in the range to keep the color from settling. Of course, it‚Äôs a pretty shade on as it has a subtle pink-to-peach shift in person, but it might be better layered over other shades or used with a lip primer. This shade lasted for three hours and was hydrating.",C
URBAN DECAY,LAWBREAKER,Lipstick,"a muted, plummy brown with neutral-to-warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-sheer, buildable coverage‚Äìwhich was in sync with its Sheer finish descriptor‚Äìthat applied evenly and smoothly. The lipstick had a lightly creamy, balm-like texture that was easy to apply to the lips and comforable to wear over the four hours it lasted. The formula felt hydrating on my lips.",A-
URBAN DECAY,BACKSTAB,Lipstick,"a rich, reddish-berry with cool, pink tones and violet and ruby red pearl. It had semi-opaque color coverage with a creamy, moderately emollient texture that glided across the lips without skipping but does feel more slippery while worn. If you‚Äôre someone who has issues with products feathering, this might be a shade to wear with a lip primer or lip liner, though I did not personally experience feathering. There was a smidgen of color that sat in my lip lines, but it did not appear as noticeable due to the glossier finish. This shade wore well for five hours, was hydrating, and left a subtle stain behind.",A-
BURBERRY,LIGHT NUDE (01),Lipstick,"light peach with warm undertones and a cream finish. The consistency was smooth, more mousse-like so there was more body to the product but never felt heavy on the lips. This shade was one that I found more difficult to apply along the edges, possibly due to the paler base; it made me want to reach for a liner just to get a better edge. It had nearly opaque color coverage that applied evenly. The color wore well for five hours and was neither drying nor hydrating, but I had color pull into my lip lines after three and a half hours of wear.",B
BURBERRY,FAWN (05),Lipstick,"deep plum with hints of rose and a subtle, warmer undertone paired with a cream finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied with even coverage. The consistency was mousse-like without being too thick or too thin, spread well, and felt ultra lightweight on. On me, the color wore well for seven hours and seemed almost hydrating overall.",A
MAC,FLESH STONE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium taupe brown with neutral-to-warm undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage in a single layer, and the color applied evenly on the lips. The consistency was thin without being watery, so it spread well but was still easy to work with. There was very slight ‚Äúcracking‚Äù where the color pulled away at my deeper lip lines (center of my bottom lip). It lasted for six and a half hours and faded fairly evenly and did not flake away. The formula was drying over time, though.",B+
MAC,DASH O' SPICE,Lipstick,"a muted, light-medium brown with strong, yellow undertones that look almost green-tinged at times. The consistency was smooth, thin but not watery and spread well across the lips without leaving behind any streaking or unevenness. It had mostly opaque coverage (but I‚Äôd go back and add a little product here and there for complete coverage) that wore well for six and a half hours. The formula was somewhat drying to me.",B+
MAC,CAF√© AU CHIC,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark brown with a hint of gray and a matte finish. It had rich, opaque color coverage that went on smoothly and evenly with little effort. It dried down fast enough that it did not immediately settle into lip lines but I still had enough time to work with it. After it dried down, there was slight ‚Äúcracking‚Äù along the center of my bottom lip. This shade lasted for six and a half hours, was somewhat drying, and faded evenly for the most part.",B
BITE BEAUTY,CAVA,Lipstick,"a soft, medium mauve with warmer, pink undertones and a soft sheen. The Luminous Creme formula is supposed to be pigmented, hydrating, and long-wearing. It had good color payoff, though it was not fully opaque, with a lightweight consistency that had moderate slip and was comfortable to wear. Some of the color pulled into my lip lines. The color lasted three hours on me but was hydrating. The Amuse Bouche version appeared lighter, a little grayer, with better coverage and longer wear.",B-
BITE BEAUTY,CAVA,Lipstick,"a muted, light-medium mauve with neutral undertones and a natural sheen. The Amuse Bouche formula is supposed to be hydrating, long-wearing, and pigmented. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a smooth, creamy consistency with some slip but good adherence as the color did not slide around while worn. The color wore well for five hours with a bit of color settling into lip lines after three hours of wear. The formula was lightly hydrating while worn.",A-
MAC,BEAUTIFULLY BARE,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium plum with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage with a creamy, smooth consistency that wasn‚Äôt sticky at all. The gloss was comfortable to wear, and though it settled into lip lines, it applied evenly and did not appear streaky. It lasted for two and a half hours and was moisturizing over time.",B-
MAC,KINDNESS,Lipgloss,"a pale beige with silvery gold and medium gold pearl. It had semi-sheer color coverage‚Äìthe base noticeably lightened my lip color‚Äìand yielded medium coverage with respect to pearl/shimmer. Some of the base color pulled into my lip lines, but the gloss applied fairly evenly overall. The color lasted for two hours and was moisturizing.",C+
MAC,TOLERANCE,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark plum with warmer, golden pearl. It had semi-opaque color coverage that spread evenly across the lips with a smooth, creamy, non-sticky texture, but there was some color that settled into lip lines. This shade lasted for three hours and was hydrating over time.",B
MAC,BUDDY,Palette,"a rose with a matte finish and a shimmery plum. Swirled together, they create a pearly, rosy plum. The matte side wasn‚Äôt quite as good as the shimmery shade, but they were both decent to good blushes. The two shades work well together, layered, or worn alone, though the shimmery shade is narrow enough that most blush brushes would not fit well (without getting some of the matte shade on them).",B+
BITE BEAUTY,ENOKI,Lipstick,"a light, peachy brown with warmer, yellow undertones and a satin finish. The color coverage was fully opaque in one pass, while the lipstick had a smooth, lightweight texture that applied without dragging or skipping on the lip. It did not have too much slip, though, so it adhered well and did not slide around. I noticed a bit of color that sunk into my lip lines after two hours of wear, while the total wear time was closer to four and a half hours.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,PORCINI,Lipstick,"a medium, yellowed brown with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had bold, opaque color payoff that covered the lips evenly. The texture was lightweight, creamy without being slippery, and glided on without tugging on the lips. It wore well for five hours and had a touch of color that pulled into my lip lines over time, but the formula was nicely hydrating while worn.",A
BITE BEAUTY,CREMINI,Lipstick,"a medium brown with warm, yellowy undertones and a cream finish. It had rich, opaque color coverage with a smooth, lightweight texture that was creamy enough to glide on without tugging but did not have too much slip, so it didn‚Äôt move around easily. It lasted for five hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",A
MAKEUP GEEK,BFF,Lipstick,"a light-medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and a natural finish. It had good color payoff, but the consistency had a little graininess to it that was noticeable when I pressed my lips together. It had good pigmentation‚Äìnearly opaque‚Äìthat covered evenly but emphasized lip lines due to settling. This shade lasted for three hours on me, but the color pulled further into my lip lines while worn. The formula was neither drying nor hydrating, and it felt comfortable to wear.",B-
MAKEUP GEEK,TROUBLEMAKER,Lipstick,"medium-dark lavender with subtle, warm undertones and a glossy, cream finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage that went on evenly with very little color that pulled into my lip lines. It felt more emollient than some of the other shades, and this one felt like it was easier to over-apply, so I recommend using less than you think and gradually building up along the edges. On me, it wore well for three and a half hours and left a fuchsia stain behind.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,PRANKSTER,Lipstick,"bright magenta purple with warm, pinky violet undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque color payoff that went on smoothly and evenly. The texture was lightweight, creamy without being too thick, and easily spread across the lips. This shade lasted for four hours and left a bright, fuchsia pink stain behind. I did not find it hydrating, but it wasn‚Äôt drying either.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,MARRIAGE MATERIAL,Lipstick,"a medium-dark plum with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. The texture was mousse-like, airy and lightweight, and while it was quite pigmented, the actual consistency was grainy and seemed poorly mixed (in terms of ingredients). The color appeared ‚Äúcracked‚Äù as the color pulled away from where my lip lines were, even though it did not dry down like a typical liquid lipstick. As the color wore on, I had more significant settling of the color into my lip lines, which made it appear more uneven overall. It lasted for four hours, left a pink stain behind, and my lips felt tight and drier after wearing it (but it did not feel dry while it was on)‚Äìalmost raw at times.",C
MAKEUP GEEK,MISFIT,Lipstick,"a muted, grayed, dark purple with neutral undertones and a satin finish. It had opaque color coverage with a very smooth, velvety consistency that was easily spread across the lips for even color. There was some separation/color in my lip lines initially, and this worsened over time. I was able to press my lips together and smooth some of the color back out but only for the first hour or two, as it wore down to a thinner, more matte finish after that. The color lasted for four and a half hours, left a faint, fuchsia stain, and was drying.",D+
MAKEUP GEEK,URBANISTA,Lipstick,"a deep, plummy purple with warmer undertones and a natural sheen. The texture was much thinner and more watery; it had a lot more slip and shine, and it did not feel like the majority of the range with respect to consistency. It had smei-opaque, uneven coverage that settled into lip lines. The color lasted for two and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating while worn.",D-
MAKEUP GEEK,JETSETTER,Lipstick,"a light-medium peachy brown with warm undertones and a lightly glossy, cream finish. The color coverage was nearly opaque, while it had a smooth, cream-like feel that spread easily across the lips. It was a little slippery, so it did settle into my lip lines over the three hours it lasted. The formula did not dry out my lips and was fairly comfortable to wear.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,OLD SOUL,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark mauve with neutral-to-cool undertones and a cream finish. It had good color coverage with a smooth, lightweight texture that was creamy without being too thin or too thick. There was a noticeable sheen and slip, and there was also a bit of color that sat in my deeper lip lines (which worsened over time). The color lasted for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,SOCIALITE,Lipstick,"a smoky, medium-dark mauve with warmer undertones and a lightly glossy finish. The pigmentation was good, though not enough to be opaque, and the texture had more slip in it than other shades, so it did not seem to apply as evenly (it did not seem to want to adhere as well on the inner area of my lips). The consistency was comfortable to wear, lasted for four hours, and felt neither drying nor hydrating while worn. This was one of the more unique shades in the range.",B
COLOURED RAINE,CLUTCH PEARLS,Eyeshadow,"a bright white with warmer undertones and a pearly sheen. The consistency was soft, a little powdery but there was a creaminess present that seemed to help it bind better when pressed and patted on the lid. It had good pigmentation and blended out well. On me, I noticed fading after eight hours of wear.",B+
COLOURED RAINE,GLISTEN,Eyeshadow,"a light gold with warm undertones and a pearly finish. The pigmentation was rich and yielded full coverage, while it had a soft, smooth consistency that wasn‚Äôt too dense or too thin, so it applied well to bare skin and blended out well without losing its intensity. It started to crease after eight and a half hours of wear.",A
COLOURED RAINE,CHAMPAGNE LIFE,Eyeshadow,"a light gold with a ‚Äúcooler‚Äù tone to it, though it was still a warmer, yellow undertone. The eyeshadow had a metallic sheen and mostly opaque coverage. It had a smooth, cream-like consistency that was dense but not too thick or too stiff in the pan. The color wore well for eight hours on me before fading.",A-
COLOURED RAINE,GLAMOUR,Eyeshadow,"a very light taupe with warm undertones and copper flecks of sparkle over a metallic finish. It had excellent color payoff with a smooth, blendable texture that was denser and cream-like but not too thick or too firm in the pan, so it applied easily. On me, the color lasted for eight and a half hours.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,28 ANTHRACITE BLACK,Eyeshadow,"a deep black with cooler, bluish undertones and blue, red, and silver pearl. Of all the shades I tried, this one had the greatest difference between dry and damp application.",B+
TOO FACED,POPPIN' PEACH,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium orange with warm, yellow undertones and a cream finish. It seemed more pigmented when I swatched it on my arm than lips, as it was only medium in coverage on the lips. It applied terribly‚Äìit emphasized my lip lines as the color pooled in them and was streaky along the edges. It lasted for two and a half hours, but the color settled more and more into my lip lines over that period. The only good thing about this shade was that it was hydrating.",D
TOO FACED,TICKLE-ME-PEACH,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium-dark coral-red with warm undertones and a cream finish. The color coverage was semi-opaque, while the texture was smooth and creamy with a balm-like feel that made it comfortable to wear. The formula felt moisturizing to me, and it lasted for four hours on me (better than most shades in the range, average for a gloss on me). What I liked about this shade was that it applied better‚Äìsmoother, glossier, and made my lips appear fuller.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,5 SILVER DUST,Highlighter,"a dirty, grayish taupe with silver, gold, white, and teal glitter. It is more ‚Äúwearable‚Äù than you might expect of a silver/gray as a highlighter, and that had a lot to do with the sheerer formula. It had more of a cooler, silver effect that did highlight on my cheeks/eyes as the base color did not come into play.",B+
NARS,THESSALONIQUE,Palette,"a soft, pale pink with a muted mauve‚Äìboth have shimmer‚Äìthat work really well together for a look but can easily be incorporated with other eyeshadows you own. I like that the two shades can create a rather foolproof look as a standalone product.",B+
TOO FACED,PEACH TEASE,Lipgloss,"a brighter, medium coral with warm, orange undertones and a cream finish. This shade had semi-opaque color payoff with a smooth, non-sticky texture that felt creamy and was comfortable to wear. The downside was that it did emphasize a few of my lip lines (but not all of them) and showed ‚Äúlines‚Äù if I pressed my lips together. The color lasted for three and a half hours on me.",B
TOO FACED,PURE PEACH,Lipgloss,"a light-medium coral with warm undertones and a cream finish. The consistency was smooth, lightly creamy, and comfortable to wear over the two hours it lasted (it was one of the shorter-wearing shades). It had medium coverage, and despite the lightness of the color, did not settle as badly as expected, but there was a bit of color in my lip lines overall. It applied fairly evenly, too, though there was room for improvement there as well.",C+
TOO FACED,"PEACH, PLEASE!",Lipgloss,"a medium, cotton candy pink with cooler, blue undertones and a cream finish. It had good color coverage, though it was not full coverage, that applied decently. It did not settle into lip lines as badly as some shades in the range did, but there was a touch of noticeable settling and it could have applied more evenly. This shade lasted for three and a half hours, which was longer than the norm, and was comfortable and hydrating while worn.",B
MAKEUP GEEK,TRAILBLAZER,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark mauve with grayer, more neutral undertones and a lightly glossy, cream finish. It had good color payoff with a smooth, cream-like texture that sat fairly well on the lips and only had slight settling toward the end of its wear time (three hours). The color applied evenly and was comfortable to wear, and I‚Äôd describe the feel of it as non-drying.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,FREE SPIRIT,Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange with warm, red undertones and a cream finish. It had good color payoff, though it was not opaque, while the texture had moderate slip, was light-medium in thickness, and spread easily. I did have trouble getting the color to stay out of lip lines, and there were minor streaks that would be visible if I pressed my lips together. On me, the color lasted for three and a half hours and left a stain behind. The formula was neither drying nor hydrating over time.",B-
MAKEUP GEEK,TROPHY WIFE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pinky-red with cool undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque color payoff that applied evenly and smoothly, as the consistency was cream-like, thin without being watery, and comfortable to wear. This shade lasted for four hours, left a bright fuchsia stain behind, and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,15 GOLDEN PINK,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, rose gold variation on copper with a metallic sheen. It was still warm-toned, but it was one of the ‚Äúless warm‚Äù copper shades due to the stronger pink-red base.",A-
NARS,ASPHALT JUNGLE,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark plummy mauve with pink and gold pearl. It had semi-opaque color coverage that went on evenly and smoothly with no visible streaking, but there was a bit of color that sat my lip lines. The glossiness and amount of shimmer made that less noticeable in person, though. It had a smooth, lightweight texture that was just lightly tacky overall. On me, the gloss wore well for four and a half hours and was moisturizing while worn.",B
NARS,ARAGON,Lipgloss,"a muted brick red with warm undertones and very fine gold shimmer. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that went on fairly evenly, but some of the gloss seemed to settle and emphasize my lip lines. The consistency was lightweight, mostly non-tacky, and comfortable tow ear over the four hours it lasted on me. It was lightly hydrating over time.",B-
NARS,BREAKING FREE,Lipstick,"a brighter, medium coral with warm, orange undertones and a satin sheen. It had good pigmentation, though it was not full coverage, with a thinner texture that tugged just slightly at the lips due to the firmer formula. The color lasted just over four hours on me, but some of the color gathered in my lip lines after two and a half hours of wear. The formula was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",B
NARS,KISS ME STUPID,Lipstick,"a medium-dark brown with warm, peachy undertones and a satin sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly. The consistency had a bit more slip and body to it compared to Breaking Free, which I suspect is why this shade applied better, was more flattering on the lips, and actually felt a little hydrating. On me, the lipstick wore well for four hours.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,4 GOLDEN PEACH,Highlighter,"light-medium gold with warm undertones and flecks of pink, gold, silver, and lighter copper glitter. The pink glitter seemed to be the most noticeable on the skin.",B+
NARS,BUMPY RIDE,Blush,"a light-medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a light golden sheen. It‚Äôs a very springy shade, and it‚Äôs a less shimmery version of their well-known Orgasm. My guess is this will work well for lighter skin tones and medium complexions who want a hint of color, as it is visible but a more subtle blush on my light-medium skin tone.",B
NARS,CHIANG MAI,Palette,"a shimmery bluish-teal and a shimmery red brown. I think you can combine the two shades together, but they were easier for me to pair with other shades for a better gradient. The left shade could be better and often looked more faded applied than it did in the pan, while the right shade was easy to use.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,13 IVORY,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium gold with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. I noticed some more obvious sparkle/micro-glitter in this shade, but it didn‚Äôt look overtly glittery on the skin. It seemed so metallic that it made the cheek area appear smooth rather than emphasizing the skin‚Äôs natural texture.",A
TARTE,VIBIN',Lipstick,"a deep red with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. I was surprised that it wasn‚Äôt more pigmented‚Äìonly semi-opaque‚Äìgiven that it was a darker red. The consistency was lightweight, smooth, and thin without feeling watery. It applied evenly on the lips, but my natural lip color was still able to come through (if your lip color is darker or more vibrant naturally, this might look different, particularly in the undertone). It wore well for five and a half hours and was drying after three hours of wear.",B+
TARTE,FORTUNE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark brown with warm, caramel undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was smooth, lightweight, and spreadable, but it dried down to a clingier finish and feel, which highlighted the texture of my lips noticeably (though my lips did not look ‚Äúcracked‚Äù upon smiling). It had semi-opaque color payoff that did apply evenly. It lasted for five hours and was moderately drying.",A-
TARTE,WANNABE,Lipstick,"a deep brown with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good color payoff, though it was not full coverage. The texture was smooth, thin without being problematic, and easy to spread across the lips for even coverage. The lipstick lasted for five hours on me and started to feel drying after three hours of wear.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,LIVELY,Lipstick,"a medium-dark plum with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation, though not quite opaque, that covered the lips with even, smooth color. The consistency had a velvety feel to it, where it was creamy without feeling wet, and glided across the lips without tugging or dragging. This shade wore well for five hours and was a touch drying.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,RISQUE,Lipstick,"a deep burgundy with warm, red undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered fairly evenly, but I did notice some of the color gathered in my deeper lip lines. The texture was somewhat smooth but deposited small grains of color for the first two uses, while subsequent swipes of the color seemed smoother and better mixed. On me, it was lightly drying over the six hours it lasted.",B
MAKEUP GEEK,SAUCY,Lipstick,"a deep, rusty copper with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had a really smooth, creamy consistency that wasn‚Äôt thick but wasn‚Äôt too thin either, so it did not feel clingy or sink easily into my lip lines. It had rich, opaque color payoff that went on evenly. This shade lasted for six hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,12 COPPER,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium-dark copper with warm, reddish-brown undertones and a metallic finish. This shade had one of the strongest finishes out of the ones I‚Äôve tried.",B+
ANASTASIA,CUSTOM,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark taupe with warmer undertones and a frosted finish. It had good color payoff with a soft, blendable texture that was somewhat dusty. The eyeshadow had a tendency to sheer out to semi-opaque coverage without a primer underneath to help it adhere to the lid better. It lasted for just over seven and a half hours on me.",B+
ANASTASIA,DUSTY ROSE,Eyeshadow,"a soft, medium mauve with neutral-to-warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage with a lightly dusty texture that was soft and blendable but had some fallout initially. As an all-over lid color, it really needed primer to perform well, but as a less intense transition shade, it worked fine without primer. This shade lasted for seven and a half hours on me before fading.",B
ANASTASIA,SANGRIA,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark reddish plum with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had good color payoff with a soft, smooth consistency that wasn‚Äôt too firm or too soft in the pan. The eyeshadow did not sheer out on the lid, but the edges were easily diffused for a blended look. I noticed fading after eight hours of wear.",A-
ANASTASIA,DEEP PLUM,Eyeshadow,"a deep reddish brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. While very soft to the touch, it kicked up a ton of excess powder as well, so it was a messier shade to work with. I would recommend lightly patting the surface with the brush, then pushing it into the skin. After getting the initial coverage down, use a clean brush to blend the edges. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading.",B-
ANASTASIA,GLISTEN,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark copper with warm, brown undertones and a frosted finish. It had opaque color payoff with a soft, lightly dusty texture that applied fairly well to bare skin, but there was some sheering out of the color without a primer. The eyeshadow was blendable, though, and lasted for seven hours on me.",B
ANASTASIA,TOPAZ,Eyeshadow,"a medium, golden brown with warm undertones and a soft, frosted finish. The eyeshadow had opaque color payoff with a smooth, lightly dusty texture that applied well and did not sheer out too readily. It lasted for eight hours on me before fading.",A-
ANASTASIA,TRUFFLE,Eyeshadow,"a dark brown with warm, reddish undertones and a satin sheen. The pigmentation was fully opaque, while the texture was firmer in the pan but still was fairly blendable. It had a tendency to take on a stronger sheen over bare skin than it did over a primer (sort of like a matte eyeshadow sometimes can darken or have a semi-matte finish on normal-to-oily skin). The color started to fade after eight hours on me.",B+
KAT VON D,ALCHEMIST,Palette,"four shades that can be used on the eyes, lips, or face and are designed to be used over other products as transformers. The formula is supposed to be pigmented. Three of the four shades have real shifts, so depending on the viewing angle, can appear more like one color or another distinct color. One shade was more iridescent in its effect.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,SHY,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark rosy mauve with a lightly glossy, cream finish. The consistency was smooth, moderately emollient, and creamy without feeling heavy (but it had a thicker, denser texture). It covered the lips with full, even coverage that lasted for just over four hours on me. The formula was noticeably moisturizing while I wore it.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,PROPER,Lipstick,"a muted, medium pink with neutral-to-warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good color coverage, though you could still see a bit of my lip freckle peeking through. The consistency had a velvety, smooth feel to it that glided easily across the lips and did not tug, but it was a denser texture and had a tendency to look ‚Äúcracked‚Äù when I smiled as the color pulled away around my deeper lip lines. This shade wore for three and a half hours and was a bit drying.",B
MAKEUP GEEK,SPOILED,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark plum with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. The pigmentation was great, while the consistency was lightly creamy, thicker without being heavy, and was very comfortable to wear. It wore for five hours, left a pink stain behind, and was lightly hydrating overall.",A
MAKEUP GEEK,QUIRKY,Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange with warm, yellow undertones and a satin finish. The texture was smooth, velvety and applied without tugging, but it did not adhere evenly to my lips and seemed to emphasize the texture noticeably. The coverage was nearly opaque, though, and it was comfortable to wear. It lasted for five hours but had noticeable color in my lip lines two and a half hours into the wear.",B
MAKEUP GEEK,CLUMSY,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark pink-coral with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had rich color coverage, but something in the texture seemed prone to making it apply unevenly with some streaking‚Äìit was hard to get the color to ‚Äústick‚Äù to my upper lip without it looking bubbly. The consistency was creamy, emollient and did not seem too slippery from feel alone, but it just did not apply that well. On me, the color lasted for four hours and was moisturizing.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,ELEGANT,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark ruby red with cool undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly. I was surprised that it wasn‚Äôt full coverage, as it‚Äôs usually the reds in a given lipstick range that do the best! The consistency was lightly creamy with some slip but did not feel slippery nor did it slide around when worn. It wore well for five hours, left a fuchsia stain behind, and was lightly hydrating.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,FEISTY,Lipstick,"a deep fuchsia-red with strong, cool pink undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was extremely firm in the tube, so the lipstick tugged and dragged when applied directly from the bullet. It was thinner and clingy, which did not make for particularly comfortable wear. It had semi-opaque color coverage that lasted for six hours but was very drying.",C+
TARTE,SIS,Lipstick,"a medium-dark plummy brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly full color coverage, but the downside this shade had was in its dry down‚Äìit was very clingy and emphasized every lip line. It ‚Äúcracked‚Äù when I smiled and just felt dry on my lips. This shade started to flake away from the center of my mouth after four hours of wear and was tolerable for six hours. It was moderately drying.",B-
TARTE,KILLIN' IT,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark plum with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff with a lightweight, thin consistency that spread evenly across the lips. This shade dried down to a smooth, matte finish that was more of a ‚Äúsoft matte‚Äù that felt flexible and wasn‚Äôt too clingy. It lasted for six hours and was a touch drying.",A
TARTE,XOXO,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark brick red with warm undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was thicker, more mousse like than your average liquid lipstick, but it spread well and had opaque color payoff. It dried down lightly tacky, even though it seemed to be transfer-proof. I also some vertical cracking, which was a new experience for me, and this was the area where the color started to flake away from while worn. It lasted decently for about five hours on me. The formula was lightly drying.",B
ESTEE LAUDER,PEACH PASSION,Blush,"light-medium pink with warm undertones and gold shimmer. Applied and blended out on the skin, the finish became more luminous with a soft glow that didn‚Äôt look like heavy shimmer and did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture.",B
COLOURED RAINE,QUEEN OF HEARTS,Palette,"twelve eyeshadows‚Äìsix matte, six foil‚Äìhoused in a slim, cardboard palette. It had a more ornate exterior sleeve (with the gold foil design), which I would have loved to have seen on the actual palette, though! The formulas used in the palette were in line with the singles I‚Äôve tried from the brand: the more shimmery shades have a denser, more cream-like texture, while the more matte shades have a drier, thinner texture (more like your average powder eyeshadow).",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,VAIN,Lipstick,"a deep berry with subtle,c ool undertones and a mostly matte finish. The texture was rather stiff, so this shade dragged and tugged as I applied it, but it was forgiving enough on the lips that it managed to distribute color fairly evenly despite the struggle to get it on in the first place. It lasted well for over six hours, left a strong fuchsia stain behind, but felt extremely drying after three hours of wear.",C+
MAKEUP GEEK,SAVVY,Lipstick,"a muted, dark purple with warmer, pink undertones and a satin finish. The consistency was firmer, slightly stiffer in the tube, and it seemed to get a little creamier after three or four uses (I applied once for photos, then once to wear, and I just kept wearing down the end on the back of my hand). It had semi-opaque pigmentation that went on fairly evenly, though it tugged a bit during application. The color stained my lips a vibrant fuchsia upon removal, which was after it wore for six hours. It was drying on me after three and a half hours of wear. The biggest upside to this shade was how unique the color was.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,SHADY,Lipstick,"a blackened berry with cool undertones and a glossy finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation paired with a very slippery consistency. The lipstick melted immediately upon contact, and I had trouble keeping the lipstick in the ‚Äúlines.‚Äù I experienced a little bit of feathering along my upper lip line, which I don‚Äôt usually experience, but this was a very dark hue with an extremely emollient texture. It was lightly hydrating and managed a good four and a half hours. This shade also left a strong, fuchsia stain behind.",B
SMASHBOX,METALLIC,Palette,"a small, travel-friendly palette that features a smoky take on earth shades of brown, plum, green, and gray. What I liked about this palette was that each well was large enough for regular eyeshadow brushes, and there was enough product across each that nothing felt skimpy. It actually is a more realistic amount of product, where one can finish and work through it, particularly for those of us with less modest stashes!",B-
TARTE,CHEERLEADER,Lipstick,"a bold, bright medium-dark red with strong, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had medium color coverage that went on fairly evenly and dried down to a flat, matte finish. It did not ‚Äúcrack‚Äù on me and was only mildly clingy while worn. The color lasted for six hours, faded away somewhat evenly, and was drying over time.",C+
TARTE,FLY,Lipstick,"a medium-dark berry with cool undertones and a matte finish. While it didn‚Äôt have the full coverage promised‚Äìit was semi-opaque‚Äìthe color applied evenly and smoothly with a thin texture that spread well but did not sink into lip lines or dry down and leave lips looking ‚Äúcracked.‚Äù The color wore well for over six hours, but the formula was somewhat drying overall.",A-
TARTE,FRIYAY,Lipstick,"a deep purple with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was thin, a little watery and had a tendency to apply unevenly. It had medium color coverage, which was not even close to the full coverage described. The formula dried down to a transfer-proof finish that was matte but did not ‚Äúcrack‚Äù when I smiled. This shade lasted for five hours, faded away more noticeably from the center of the mouth, and was mildly drying.",C
TARTE,ACID WASH,Lipstick,"a blackened berry with cool undertones and a flat, matte finish. This was one of the worse shades, as it applied unevenly, was incredibly drying over time, and did not even have opaque coverage. This was painfully drying, as my lips felt raw and started to peel after wearing this for six hours (to add insult to injury, it also faded unevenly).",D-
CHANEL,BEIGE DORE (126),Lipstick,"a soft gold with fine pearl and a luminous sheen. It had sheer coverage, which primarily added a little warmth to my natural lip color and a moderate shimmer and shine.",B-
CHANEL,NOIR MODERNE (128),Lipstick,"a muted,d ark plum with subtle, warm undertones and a soft sheen. It had sheer coverage, but the deeper hue made it more impactful; this is the type of coverage level that can create a lot of variance in how it translates from person to person due to just how much of the natural lip color comes through, but it will likely darken your natural lip color while adding some plummy color. The consistency was balm-like, emollient, and spread easily across the lips, and I had very little color that sat in lip lines but there was a bit. This shade wore well for three hours on me and was a touch moisturizing.",B+
COLOURED RAINE,ST. GERMAIN COCKTAIL,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic finish. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, cream-like texture that applied evenly to the lid. I had no trouble blending out the color along the edges. This shade lasted for eight and a half hours before creasing.",A
COLOURED RAINE,FLASHY,Eyeshadow,"a bright, light-medium gold with warmer undertones and a metallic sheen. It almost looked like a duochrome, but if there‚Äôs a shift, it‚Äôs very, very subtle. The consistency was smooth, dense, and cream-like, which worked well for applying it directly to bare skin as it went on with rich, opaque and even coverage. It lasted for eight hours on me.",A
COLOURED RAINE,SUPERSTAR,Eyeshadow,"a deep gold with strong, warm yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. It had rich, opaque color payoff that applied evenly to the lid. The texture was fairly smooth, blendable, and easy to work with. I noticed slight creasing after eight hours of wear.",A-
COLOURED RAINE,HAPPY DAZE,Eyeshadow,"a medium peach with warm, orange undertones and a pink shift. It had a more noticeable duochrome that shifted from a golden peach to a pinky-peach. The consistency was denser and had a tendency to come away in chunks, so it did not apply as evenly to the lid as a lot of the other shades as it lacked some of the creaminess present in more blendable shades. It did last for eight hours, though.",B-
COLOURED RAINE,SHORT CAKE,Eyeshadow,"a bright, light-medium coral with a sparkling, frosted finish. It had a very dense texture, which made it a little harder to work with fluffier eyeshadow brushes; I had the best luck using a flat, synthetic brush, as that picked up product better. The eyeshadow had great pigmentation, and once on the lid, it was surprisingly blendable and easy to work with. It lasted for eight and a half hours on me.",B+
COLOURED RAINE,PUMPKIN PIE,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium-dark orange with warm, red undertones and a fine, golden sheen. The color coverage was totally opaque, while the eyeshadow had a cream-like feel to the touch, so it was denser but still pliable and blendable on the skin. It applied evenly to bare lids and lasted for eight hours on me.",A-
TOO FACED,SWEET PEACH,Palette,"a re-release, but this time it is noted as permanent by Too Faced!",B-
TOO FACED,SWEET PEACH GLOW,Palette,"a highlighter, blush, and bronzer. The blush contains more product (almost double) compared to the highlighter and bronzing shade. Everything is housed in a pink-to-orange gradient, metal tin (like the Sweet Peach palette). The palette was good, though the shades themselves may be found within your stash already, and if you have a deeper skin tone, the blush and bronzer might not be visible enough for your liking. The texture of all three shades was firmer and denser but not really stiff‚Äìthey are in the vein of MAC Extra Dimension Skinfinishes, NARS Dual-Intensity Blushes, etc. They blended out nicely and lasted for eight to nine hours on me. The palette has the same peach scent as all of the other Sweet Peach products.",A-
SMASHBOX,NUDE MOOD,Lipstick,"a soft, muted coral with warm undertones and a lightly glossy, luminous finish. It had medium coverage that was buildable up to semi-opaque coverage. Unfortunately, this shade was not described as sheer by the brand.",B
SMASHBOX,JUST HIT PLAY,Lipstick,"a brighter, medium pink with subtle, warmer undertones and a satin finish. It had good pigmentation that applied without tugging on the lips, as the texture was creamy with light slip. It sat better on the lips than some of the other recently reviewed shades in the range, but there was a touch of color in my lip lines. It wore well for four and a half hours and was moisturizing while worn.",B+
SMASHBOX,ON SET,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark rosy mauve with subtle, warm undertones and a smattering of gold pearl. It had good color payoff, though not quite opaque, that applied evenly and smoothly. The texture had slip to it, but it had more substance and seemed to smooth over the lips better than other shades have for me, so it did not emphasize lip lines or sit in them. It lasted for just over four hours on me and was moisturizing for me.",A-
CHANEL,CODES ELEGANTS (274),Palette,"a new, permanent palette released in the spring collection, though it gave me a New Year‚Äôs Eve vibe with all the shimmer and gold tones. The formula is the same as the other quads in the Les 4 Ombres range, which is supposed to be ‚Äúvibrant, pigment-rich‚Äù with ‚Äúlong-lasting pigments‚Äù and ‚Äúeffortless application.‚Äù It‚Äôs a stunning set of shades that work well together, is easy to apply and blend out, and lasts for eight hours (without primer). The biggest ‚Äúcon‚Äù to this palette is just that the shades are more dupable, so you may already have similar golds and browns in your stash!",A
TOO FACED,PAPA DON'T PEACH,Blush,"a medium, coral-copper with warm undertones and a pinkish tint paired with a soft, frosted finish.",A-
ESTEE LAUDER,LOVER'S BLUSH,Blush,"a soft, light-medium coral with warm undertones and a golden, satin shimmer. It had semi-sheer color payoff that was buildable to medium coverage.",B
TARTE,PILLOWTALK,Lipstick,"a light peach with a hint of pink paired with a flat, matte finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage, which went on fairly evenly, but it had a little bit of streaking, even after it had finished drying. The texture was unforgiving when I smiled, with the color separating at my deepest lip lines. This shade lasted for four and a half hours before it had broken down so much at the center of the lips that reapplication would have been necessary to keep wearing it. The formula was moderately drying while worn.",C+
TARTE,SALTY,Lipstick,"a medium peach with warm undertones, a subtle pink tint, and a matte finish. The color payoff was almost opaque, but there was some translucency so a second layer would be recommended for fuller coverage. Like Pillowtalk, the color pulled away at the lip lines and looked ‚Äúcracked.‚Äù This shade lasted for four hours and was drying while worn, plus the way it wore down was uneven (strongest fading at the center of the mouth).",C+
TARTE,GET IT!,Lipstick,"a medium-dark peach with warm, orange undertones and a matte finish. It had good color payoff, though it was not fully opaque in a single layer‚Äìtwo layers would be necessary for full coverage. The texture was smooth, lightly creamy, and easy to to spread across the lips, but it was a bit streaky (even after it dried down). It didn‚Äôt ‚Äúcrack‚Äù when I smiled, but it was clingy and drying over the five hours it lasted. I also found that it faded unevenly over time.",B
SMASHBOX,FAIRPLAY,Lipstick,"a very light lavender with a strong white base paired with a satin finish. It was supposed to be matte, but it definitely took a couple of hours for the shine to wear it down to more of a matte finish in my experience.",B-
SMASHBOX,GETS IT,Lipstick,"a muted, light-medium pink with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. The consistency was smooth, velvety without being powdery or dry, so it glided across the lips without tugging. It had mostly opaque color coverage and a medium thickness, which did make the color more prone to pooling in my lip lines (mostly the bottom, deeper ones). It lasted for four hours on me and was just a touch hydrating.",B
SMASHBOX,FANMAIL,Lipstick,"a bright, lavender pink with warm undertones and a natural finish with fine pearl. It had semi-opaque color coverage with a moderately emollient texture that felt slippery on the lips, so it showed ‚Äúlines‚Äù if I pressed my lips together and gathered in some of my lip lines. I think the brightness of the hue made it harder to notice from a normal viewing distance, though. This shade wore nicely for four and a half hours and was moisturizing.",B+
CHANEL,CODES SUBTILS (278),Palette,"a new, limited edition palette for spring. The formula is the same as the other quads in the Les 4 Ombres range, which is supposed to be ‚Äúvibrant, pigment-rich‚Äù with ‚Äúlong-lasting pigments‚Äù and ‚Äúeffortless application.‚Äù All four eyeshadows had a really soft, finely-milled quality that made application easy‚ÄìI had no trouble applying and blending out the eyeshadows to create a cohesive look.",A
CHANEL,ELEGANCE (370),Blush,"a soft, medium-dark brown with warm, orange undertones and a satin sheen. The formula is supposed to be ‚Äúsoft‚Äù and ‚Äúsilky‚Äù with a radiant finish. Elegance had good color payoff‚Äìnot quite opaque but definitely buildable to opaque coverage in two layers‚Äìwith a soft, silky texture that didn‚Äôt kick up much excess powder in the pan. The blush blended out beautifully on the skin and gave it a natural sheen that did not look shimmery, just glowy. On me, it wore well for just over eight hours before fading.",A-
CHANEL,COCO CODE,Blush,"a soft, medium pink-coral with fine gold shimmer over a semi-matte finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable color coverage.",A-
CHANEL,ARDENTE (175),Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange-red with warm undertones and a satin finish. The Rouge Allure Luminous Lip Color formula is supposed to have ‚Äúintense‚Äù coverage with long-wear and a satin finish. This shade had nearly opaque color coverage that applied smoothly and evenly. The texture was thin but very, very smooth and lightweight on the lips without being clingy. This shade lasted for five hours, stained my lips moderately, and was slightly hydrating over time.",A
CHANEL,INDEPENDANTE (176),Lipstick,"a medium red with subtle, cool undertones and a seatin finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage that went on evenly and did not tug or pull ont he lips. While the consistency was thin on the lips and nearly weightless, it didn‚Äôt feel clingy or drying over time. The lipstick was smooth, creamy without being emollient, and was comfortable to wear for the six hours this shade lasted for.",A-
SMASHBOX,NUDE BEACH,Lipstick,"a medium coral with warm, orange undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque color payoff with a lightly creamy texture that had some slip but wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin on the lips.",B
SMASHBOX,CALL BACK,Lipstick,"a soft, light-medium coral with warm undertones and a slightly pinker tinter paired with a soft sheen. The color had a stronger white base, as I found it to look lighter and pinker applied to my lips. The texture was emollient with moderate slip, but it ran thinner and had a tendency to emphasize any imperfection I had. It went on evenly, but there was some color that slipped into my lip lines. The lipstick wore nicely for three hours, and it was hydrating over time.",B-
SMASHBOX,EASY,Lipstick,"a soft, medium pink-coral with a soft sheen. The brand described it as ‚Äúsheer brick,‚Äù which I sort of see, but the sheer part is definitely true‚Äìit had sheer coverage with noticeable gold pearl and glossiness. The consistency was comfortable to wear and didn‚Äôt tug when applied directly to the lips, but it filled my lip lines noticeably. This shade lasted for three hours on me, but it was moisturizing.",B
COLOURED RAINE,CHAMELEON,Eyeshadow,"a light lavender with subtle, cool undertones and a pearl finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage with a soft, thinner texture; it didn‚Äôt feel as dense as most of the Coloured Raine shimmery eyeshadows did, but it was softer and more finely-milled compared to their mattes (in general). It was blendable and easy to apply to the lid, but it sheered out a bit without a primer. This shade wore well for seven hours on me before fading.",B-
COLOURED RAINE,FLASHING LIGHTS,Eyeshadow,"a bright silver with cooler undertones and a metallic sheen. It had a denser, thicker consistency that applied best with a flat, firm synthetic brush than a fluffier eyeshadow brush, but I had no trouble getting even, smooth coverage that adhered well to bare skin. It was fairly blendable around the edges. It lasted for eight hours before creasing very faintly on me.",A-
COLOURED RAINE,SIDE OF OLIVES,Eyeshadow,"a medium olive green with warm, olive undertones and a golden, metallic sheen. The pigmentation was rich and opaque, while the consistency had a denser, firmer feel to it that was like a pressed cream, but it wasn‚Äôt difficult to work with, and I didn‚Äôt have trouble blending or diffusing the edges of this shade on the lid. It started to show some creasing after eight hours of wear.",A-
COLOURED RAINE,UNEXPECTED,Eyeshadow,"a dark jade green with subtle, cooler undertones and a warmer, golden sheen. It had intense color payoff with a cream-like, smooth texture that was denser and adhered really well without the need of a primer. I did have some trouble blending it out, as it had a tendency to look a bit patchy as the shimmer separated from the base color.",A-
COLOURED RAINE,BLACK MOON,Eyeshadow,"a deep black with neutral-to-warm undertones and a satin finish. It seemed more matte in the pan, but it seemed to have a bit of a sheen to it when applied to bare skin. It was intensely pigmented and applied evenly to the skin, but it could have been more blendable‚Äìit worked well for intense, all-over color but wasn‚Äôt as good for darkening the crease and the like. The color lasted for eight hours on me before fading.",B+
ESTEE LAUDER,POPPY PASSION,Blush,"a bold, medium-dark red with warmer undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff from the get-go, which was buildable to full coverage, if desired.",B
LANCOME,AUDACITY IN LONDON,Palette,"16 eyeshadows and most of them are terrible. Even when they swatched decently‚Äìwhich is probably being generous‚Äìthey applied worse on the lid, as the thin, dusty textures did no favors on my lids. The eyeshadows applied unevenly, patchily, and often looked like faded versions of the way they did in the pan, which meant that they tended to muddy and lose contrast as they are more muted colors to begin. If the palette was actually pigmented, blendable, long-wearing, and easy to use, the color scheme would be more unique. Instead, we have a palette that does little well.",F
SMASHBOX,SMOKY,Palette,"a small, travel-friendly palette that features a smoky take on earth shades of brown, plum, green, and gray. The formula is supposed to be ‚Äúhighly pigmented‚Äù with a ‚Äúbeyond blendable‚Äù texture. All eight shades had good pigmentation, were fairly blendable, and wore for seven to eight hours. Some shades were a touch dusty, which may have resulted in a bit of fallout during application or shorter-wear, but overall, the palette was easy to use, and the colors chosen make sense within the theme.",B+
SMASHBOX,SKINNY JEANS,Lipstick,"a medium-dark blue with fine pearl. The pearl is less obvious once applied, but there is a subtle sheen and luminosity to the finish from it.",C+
SMASHBOX,DEEP,Lipstick,"a deep navy blue with strong, cool undertones (almost looks purple) with fine blue and violet pearl. It had semi-opaque color coverage with a lightweight consistency that wasn‚Äôt too thin or too thick, spread fairly well across the lips, but it did look uneven and patchy in places. I also had trouble with color pulling into my lip lines from the beginning. It lasted for five hours, stained my lips slightly, and was lightly hydrating.",B-
SMASHBOX,BANKROLLED,Lipstick,"a medium black with neutral undertones and a soft, teal pearl. It had sheer coverage, so it was better at darkening other colors (including one‚Äôs natural lip color) but is just so-so on its own, as it settled into lip lines and didn‚Äôt look even. It lasted for four hours on me, but the color did sink further into my lip lines over time. This shade was described as a ‚Äúsheer black cream‚Äù by the brand, so the color coverage is in line with how it was described.",B-
URBAN DECAY,AFTERDARK,Palette,"ten shimmery eyeshadows from white gold to deep navy. There are three ‚Äúcult favorites‚Äù and seven ‚Äúnew‚Äù shades, and if you have a few palettes and singles from the brand, ‚Äúnew‚Äù might very well be ‚Äúold.‚Äù I definitely noticed a few shades shared more than a few similarities to past releases! This palette is limited and edition and exclusive to Sephora with an online release date of December 20th and an in-store release date of January 27th.",A-
TARTE,HOMESLICE,Lipstick,"a medium coral with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good color payoff, but it was not full coverage; you‚Äôd definitely need to apply a second layer to get that level of coverage. The consistency was thin, a little streaky and hard to spread across the lips without the color sinking into lip lines. This shade lasted for five hours but had some uneven fading around the center of the mouth. It felt a bit drying over time.",C+
TARTE,DELISH,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark rosy plum with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had opaque color coverage that applied smoothly and evenly on the lips. The consistency was thin, lightweight, and spread across the lips without streaking and dried down to a matte finish that did not appear dry or cracked. This shade wore well for five hours on me and was just a touch drying overall.",A
TARTE,ROSE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium rose with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque pigmentation that went on evenly, but I had issues with the color drying down smoothly as it appeared ‚Äúcracked‚Äù as I moved my mouth. The consistency didn‚Äôt seem overly watery, but it ran thinner and dried down faster than other shades, so it was harder to work with as a result. This shade wore for closer to five and a half hours, but there was uneven fading across the lips due to how it ‚Äúcracked‚Äù to begin with, so the color flaked away in some places. The formula was moderately drying on me.",B-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,LILAC (500),Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark purple with warm, pink undertones and a creamy finish. It had rich, opaque color coverage achieved with little product, and I‚Äôd say that semi-opaque coverage was within reach with just the barest dab of product (which also looked more semi-matte and stain-like).",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,DARK PURPLE (600),Lipstick,"a blackened purple with warmer undertones and a cream finish with moderate glossiness. It was intensely pigmented; even when I applied the barest amount to the lips, I was just able to get a warmer, redder version that still covered my lips entirely (it had more depth and blackness when applied with a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù amount of product). The texture was smooth, a little creamy without being heavy or too slippery, and was easy to work with. I didn‚Äôt experience any feathering or bleeding color over the six hours it lasted, and it was neither drying nor hydrating over time.",A-
URBAN DECAY,BRUISE,NailPolish,"a deep, purplish brown base with green-to-teal pearl that shifts. The shimmer was rather fine, and I did have some trouble smoothing out the pearl and polish so that it looked like an even, shimmery finish‚Äìlooked a little more like threads of shimmer, unfortunately! The consistency was thicker and did not self-level as it dried down. It was fully opaque after two coats, and it lasted for seven days on me with minor tip wear.",B+
URBAN DECAY,ROACH,NailPolish,"a deep, reddish brown with warm undertones and shimmer that shifted from dirty, olive gold to warm brown. The consistency was smooth, not too thick or too thin, and it applied beautifully to the nails with rich, opaque color in two coats, though one was almost opaque. I typically get a week of wear out of the brand‚Äôs formula.",A
URBAN DECAY,PLAGUE,NailPolish,"a rich, blackened purple with cool, violet sparkle and fine pearl. It had opaque color coverage with two coats (almost opaque in one). The consistency was thin without being watery, so it didn‚Äôt pool along the edges of my nails nor did it sheer out or appear uneven on the nail. It dried down to a modewrate shine, but I think a top coat is necessary for true glossiness. I wore this one and only had minor tip wear after seven days.",A-
URBAN DECAY,RADIUM,NailPolish,"a bright, medium-dark blue with cool undertones and lighter blue pearl. It had more of a pearly finish‚Äìnot quite metallic and not frosted or sparkly, as the particle size was rather fine. The texture was thicker, and it was hard to manage the amount of product on the nail; one coat was really sufficient with this one unless you were very, very careful and wiped away excess to get a thinner initial coat. Urban Decay‚Äôs nail polish lasts around a week with minor tip wear for me.",B+
URBAN DECAY,FROSTBITE,NailPolish,"a deep, blackened navy blue with fine bits of lighter blue pearl. It had intense color coverage with a smooth consistency that wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin, so it covered the nail evenly and didn‚Äôt require any extra work to maneuver it across the nail. I typically get a week of wear with Urban Decay‚Äôs formula with minor tip wear.",A-
URBAN DECAY,UV-B,NailPolish,"a bright, medium-dark cobalt blue with cool, purplish undertones and fine pearl. It had opaque pigmentation after two coats of polish, though the texture was more watery than ideal. It resulted in slightly streakier shimmer, as you could see where the brush wobbled and wiggled down my nail. It seemed to self-level a fair amount, but it wasn‚Äôt completely gone after drying down. This shade lasted for seven days with minor tip wear on me.",B
MAKE UP FOR EVER,CANDY PINK (200),Lipstick,"a bright, cotton candy pink with cool, blue undertones and a cream finish. It had intense, opaque color coverage with little product.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,FUCHSIA PINK (201),Lipstick," a bright, medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a creamy, lightly glossy finish. It had good color payoff‚Äìfrom semi-opaque to fully opaque‚Äìwith a smooth, lightweight texture that wasn‚Äôt tacky and felt comfortable tow ear. The color wore down to a satin finish (but never looked fully matte) after a few hours, though the color lasted for over six on me. I noticed that some color welled in my lip lines, which was my least favorite part about the formula, but it was true its non-drying claim.",B+
ESTEE LAUDER,PINK INGENUE,Blush,"a medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable color payoff that was true-to-pan in color and depth.",A-
TOO FACED,WHITE,Palette,"11 eyeshadows in a small, compact case. I had no trouble getting an average-sized eyeshadow brush into each pan, but the quality of the palette was actually surprisingly bad‚Äìthere was a cheapness to the formula that made colors look lighter and more white-based to the point where half the shades looked alike once on the lid. This was compounded by the fact that the palette itself lacks variety; a lot of light and light-medium shades and the one really dark shade (which ends up making more work for you as it was so difficult to blend and keep to small areas due to how dusty it was).",D
ESTEE LAUDER,CHRISTMAS KISS,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pinky-red with fine ruby red and pink pearl. It had nearly opaque color coverage that went on evenly and smoothly.",A
COLOUR POP,PEACHY KEEN,Palette,"four warm-toned neutrals. Three of the shades are ones we‚Äôve seen before; only Kennedy is new (at least, I can‚Äôt recall that one). All four performed well, and they coordinated well with enough contrast and variety of finishes to create a few looks out of them.",A
NARS,UNFILTERED II,Palette,"six shades of blushes with a mix of finishes (matte, high shimmer, and satin) and colors (pinks, peaches, and plum). I think that the shades in this palette are a little more dupable compared to Unfiltered I, and they run light to medium (though one shade is deeper) and will show up better on fair to medium complexions. Overall, the palette was pigmented, long-wearing, and fairly blendable.",B+
GIVENCHY,PALETTE ORS AUDACIEUX,Palette,"a new, limited edition holiday quartet that features four, shimmering shades. The formula is a wet/dry one, where wet application increases the ‚Äúdensity and brilliance.‚Äù For the most part, I did not notice significant differences between dry and damp application, except with the third one, which had the most glitter. I could see this working best with other shades in one‚Äôs stash, like a few matte shades, perhaps a black or deep brown for more contrast, as it could use more contrast for greater versatility.",B
CATRICE,LA VIE EN ROSE,Blush,"a light-medium pink with warm undertones and a soft, satiny sheen. It had mostly opaque color payoff with a soft, lightly dusty texture that was very blendable but did sheer out a bit on the skin. I expect that lighter skin tones will find it easy to work with it, as the coverage was forgiving, but it may not have enough depth for deeper skin tones (I hope Catrice will consider adding deeper shades to their range!).",B+
SMASHBOX,GOLDEN HOUR,Palette,"a small, travel-friendly palette that features a warm, gold and plum-themed color scheme across eight shades. What I liked about this palette was that each well was large enough for regular eyeshadow brushes, and there was enough product across each that nothing felt skimpy. It actually is a more realistic amount of product, where one can finish and work through it, particularly for those of us with less modest stashes!",B+
NARS,UNFILTERED I,Palette,"six powder blushes. It‚Äôs a new, limited edition palette for spring, which should officially release soon. There is another palette‚ÄìUnfiltered II‚Äìwhich features cooler, softer shades and leans pinker overall, while this one is bolder, richer, and warmer across the board. I think there‚Äôs a good mix of finishes, lights and darks, and like the addition of one cooler shade that still makes sense with the other shades.",A-
COLOUR POP,CATNAP,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark copper with hints of pink and copper sparkle over a metallic finish. It had semi-sheer coverage, which was not very buildable, unfortunately. This is a shade that would work best as an all-over wash of color or patted on top of another, more opaque eyeshadow to add sparkle and shine. I didn‚Äôt see any indication that was designed to be sheer on ColourPop‚Äôs website, as sometimes they release glittery, sheer shades. The texture was smooth, lightly wet, and blendable on the skin, and the eyeshadow wore for ten hours with minimal fallout.",B-
COLOUR POP,PUPPY LOVE,Eyeshadow,"a soft, light peach with an iridescent pink to gold shift paired with a pearly sheen. It had good color payoff‚Äìalmost opaque‚Äìand actually seemed smoother and more pigmented than the original release. It was easier to apply, too, to the lid and did not lose its coverage when blended unless intended! It wore well for ten hours without fading or creasing on me.",A
TARTE,TARTEIST PRO GLOW TO GO,Palette,"two highlighters and one contour powder. It‚Äôs a compact trio housed in a slim, black cardboard palette that had a velvety feel on the outside (like NARS‚Äô packaging in a way). I think it will work for someone who likes warmer, more intense highlighters and has use for the tone and depth of contour powder. The problem with something like this is that it‚Äôs just not going to work for all skin tones and undertones (I always want brands to at least put out a cool and warm version, if not a light/medium/dark).",A-
CATRICE,CORAL ME MAYBE,Blush,"a pop of light-medium pink-coral with warm undertones and fine, flecks of gold shimmer strewn on top of a more matte finish. It appeared more satiny on the skin, once I had a chance to blend and buff the powder onto my cheeks, but it definitely had a subtler finish, which would make it ideal for someone who doesn‚Äôt like a lot of noticeable shimmer in their cheek color.",C
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,TRUTH OR BARE,Lipstick,"medium pink with warm undertones and a creamy, lightly glossy finish. It had opaque color coverage that spread evenly across the lips.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,"SHUSH, BLUSH",Lipstick,"a deep, plummy rose with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. The texture was smooth, lightweight, not too thick or too thin, and was easy to work with. The color wore well for six hours, left a very, very faint stain behind, and was moisturizing while worn.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,TRUTH OR BARE,Lipstick,"medium pink with warm undertones and a creamy, lightly glossy finish. It had opaque color coverage that spread evenly across the lips.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,"SHUSH, BLUSH",Lipstick,"a deep, plummy rose with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips. The texture was smooth, lightweight, not too thick or too thin, and was easy to work with. The color wore well for six hours, left a very, very faint stain behind, and was moisturizing while worn.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,YOURS TO TRY,Lipstick,"a medium peach with warm, orange undertones and a satin finish. There was a noticeable sheen, but it wore down to more of a true satin finish after two hours of wear.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,FAWN OVER ME,Lipstick,"a medium, peachy beige with a hint of pink and a creamy, satiny finish. This shade was a little glossier than Yours to Try, but it wore down to a true satin finish after a couple of hours on the lips.",B+
LANCOME,BLANC SCINTILLANT,Eyeshadow,"a bright, sparkling white with subtle, warmer undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. It had semi-sheer coverage applied dry and semi-opaque coverage applied damp. The consistency was soft, a little dry and looser in the pan, and this particularly shade was better used with a damp brush, as it applied more evenly. The color lasted for eight and a half hours both dry and damp, but this was nowhere near the 16-hours claimed.",C+
LANCOME,ROSE SATIN,Eyeshadow,"a very light peach with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-sheer coverage applied dry, which was blendable and worked best as a soft wash of color. It had mostly opaque coverage when applied with a damp brush, and it had a more metallic finish. The consistency was soft, a touch loose in the pan but did not result in a lot of fallout during application. The color wore well for eight hours on me.",B
LANCOME,BRUNE GLACE,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, rosy copper with warm undertones and a metallic finish. It had good color payoff both dry and damp, though it was a bit darker and more metallic when applied with a damp brush. The consistency was soft, smooth, and blendable, while the eyeshadow adhered well to bare skin and wore for nine hours before creasing‚Äìstill not close to the 16-hour mark, unfortunately.",B
LANCOME,HOTEL PARTICULIER,Eyeshadow,"a deep, smoky purple with warmer undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. Applied dry, it had semi-opaque, softer color payoff with more of a satin to pearl finish. Applied damp, it was richly pigmented and had a more pronounced, reflective sheen. It was easy to apply to bare skin both wet and dry, but the richer payoff of the damp application made it easier to apply it evenly and still blend it out well. This shade lasted for nine hours on me.",B
THEBALM,BALM BEACH,Blush,"a muted, medium pink with strong, warm undertones and a matte finish. It‚Äôs the type of color that pairs well with a lot of looks so long as your skin tone is light-medium or fairer (it shows up as a subtle color on my skin tone, and I‚Äôm light-medium to medium). I did find that the color darkened just a tad on the skin, but if you are drier, you might get truer-to-pan color.",B+
JOUER,TOPAZ,Highlighter,"a light-medium, rosy copper with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. This is a more typical highlighting color, and it should work well on many skin tones, particularly medium and deeper complexions.",A
CLE DE PEAU,MODERN ERA (315),Palette,"a shimmery, green-themed ‚Äúquad.‚Äù All four shades were decent to good with slightly softer, looser consistencies, which made a couple shades appear sheerer and fade a bit faster. Both were solvable with regular eyeshadow primer as a base. The pop of brighter, lighter green was interesting, as it had a starker appearance but still paired well with the other shades when I tried it.",B+
CLARINS,NUDE (01),Palette,"four powder eyeshadows that are supposed to be usable both wet and dry and have long-wearing results. It‚Äôs a peachy twist on neutrals‚Äìnot quite orange, not quite pink. I like that there was a really deep shade, which made it more versatile and added much-needed contrast to the palette. While you can apply them wet or dry, I only felt one of the four shades really benefited from damp application significantly, so it is definitely wearable if you prefer to use your eyeshadows dry.",B+
COLOUR POP,JUST FUR FUN,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium pink with soft, yellow undertones and gold glitter. It had semi-opaque coverage, which was somewhat buildable but never looked fully opaque. It had a smooth, lightly wet texture that blended out easily, while the flecks of glitter seemed flatter and adhered better to the skin. The eyeshadow wore well for ten hours without creasing and had just a touch of fallout.",A-
COLOUR POP,KOOSH,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium, golden taupe with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good color coverage with a very smooth, noticeably emollient (but not too wet) texture that didn‚Äôt sheer out immediately but remained blendable. The color was still going strong after nine hours of wear.",A
COLOUR POP,SLEIGH,Eyeshadow,"a dirty, medium olive green with flecks of gold sparkle. It had semi-sheer coverage and felt wetter to the touch. This shade seemed prone to sheering out and applying unevenly, as some of the sparkle/glitter would overlap. I didn‚Äôt have any real wear issues, as what I applied looked good ten hours later, and there were only a few specks of fallout.",C-
COLOUR POP,TINSEL,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark rosy mauve with flecks of silver sparkle. It had mostly opaque color coverage with a smooth, blendable texture that wasn‚Äôt too thin or too thick and spread well across the lid without losing intensity. The color wore well for ten hours with minimal fallout.",A
COLOUR POP,ARROW,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark copper with warm, brown undertones and flecks of red and copper sparkle. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a smooth, almost wet-like consistency, but it had a tendency to sheer out on the skin and was not as buildable as a lot of the other shades I‚Äôve tried in this formula. It lasted for over nine hours with minimal fallout and no creasing.",B+
COLOUR POP,CUSP,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium-dark lime greem with warmer, yellow undertones and cooler, green sparkle. It had semi-opaque color coverage that did not apply as evenly as I would have liked. The texture felt wetter and had more slip, which I expect is part of why it looked more uneven on the skin than other shades in the formula have for me. The results were the same whether I used fingertips or brushes to apply. It still lasted for a long time‚Äìover nine hours‚Äìso at least there was that.",B-
COLOUR POP,DANCE PARTY,Eyeshadow,"a muted, dark purple with subtle, cool undertones and pink and purple flecks of sparkle. This shade has been released before, but the version most recently released seemed darker and warmer. It had good color payoff, though it was not opaque and did not build up well. The consistency felt smooth, blendable, and a little wetter and more prone to sheering out on the skin than most shades in the formula have in the past. It wore for nine hours without any fallout.",B+
COLOUR POP,FAR SIDE,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, golden brown with warm undertones and flecks of golden bronze sparkle. It had opaque color coverage that blended out easily and applied evenly. Even though it had more glitter in it, I didn‚Äôt notice more than a few flecks of fallout after ten hours of wear.",A
COLOUR POP,SAILOR,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium, golden beige with warm undertones and a lightly metallic, sparkling finish. The pigmentation was fantastic, while the consistency was smooth, blendable, and easy to apply to bare skin. It wore well for ten hours without fading or creasing.",A+
COLOUR POP,TO AND FROM,Palette,"six twist-up lipsticks. It‚Äôs currently listed as sold out on the brand‚Äôs website, but you never know with ColourPop‚Äìthey have restocked limited edition products before, plus some shades are available individually.",B+
JOUER,ROSE QUARTZ,Highlighter,"a light pink with warm undertones and a golden, metallic sheen. It‚Äôs the type of highlighter that imparts a touch of color on my skin tone but is mostly a highlighter‚Äìon fairer complexions, it might be a subtle blush as well.",A-
BURBERRY,GOLD SHIMMER NO. 28,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette for the holidays. It contained a ‚Äúcooler‚Äù gold, medium gold, soft bronze, and brighter, golden bronze.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,WARM (02),Palette,"one of two limited edition, holiday palettes from the brand, and it is the ‚Äúwarmer‚Äù of the two. The packaging is the signature white of the Soleil collections, and it comes with a large, interior mirror; it felt substantial to hold and clicked together nicely.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,COOL (01),Palette,"one of two limited edition, holiday palettes from the brand, and it is the ‚Äúcooler‚Äù of the two, though some shades are still warm-toned overall. The packaging is the signature white of the Soleil collections, and it comes with a large, interior mirror; it felt substantial to hold and clicked together nicely.",A-
COLOUR POP,ARIGATO,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and gold, silver, and fuchsia sparkle. It has a Sheer finish, which is apt, as the coverage was sheer. It darkened and added pink to my natural lip color, but it may look quite different depending on what your natural lip color is. The texture was smooth, lightweight, and non-sticky on the lips, which made it comfortable to wear for the three and a half hours it lasted for.",A-
COLOUR POP,SUPERCUTE,Lipgloss,"a sheer, pink-based gloss with silver and pink sparkle. It‚Äôs the kind of gloss that is mostly sparkle/shimmer, which works well for layering over other lip colors to add shine and shimmer or to enhance your natural lip color without really altering it. It had a smooth, thin consistency that wasn‚Äôt too thin, because I didn‚Äôt feel the shimmer/sparkles on the lips while I wore the gloss. The gloss wore for just over three hours on me.",B+
COLOUR POP,TRINKETS,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark fuchsia-red with cool undertones and barley-there gold pearl. It had semi-sheer pigmentation that went on fairly evenly with only some color that darkened my lip lines. It seemed significantly more pigmented than a lot of the other Sheer finish shades I‚Äôve tried, though it‚Äôs not opaque either. The color was smooth, non-tacky, and lasted for three and a half hours on me.",B
COLOUR POP,DATE MATE,Lipstick,"a deep fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a flat, matte finish. The consistency was much drier and firmer than the majority of Lippie Stix I‚Äôve come across, which made it tug and pull at the lips when I attempted to apply it. I was quite surprised that it applied as evenly as it did, as stiffer formulations usually end up looking streaky, thick, and uneven. The formula was clingy, which made it feel drier on, though it did not start to feel drying until three hours into wear (of total of six hours of wear).",B-
COLOUR POP,KONICHIWA,Lipstick,"a muted, medium pink with cool undertones and a natural finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a moderately emollient texture that was lightly tacky. The lipstick felt firmer in the tube, but it warmed up and melted against the warmth of my lips, which made it more malleable. It‚Äôs part of the Creme finish range, which is supposed to have ‚Äúmedium to full coverage,‚Äù so it seemed like it was in line with the description (most of the Lippie Stix finishes are full coverage). This shade wore for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",A-
COLOUR POP,LET'S PLAY,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark ruby red with cool undertones and pink and ruby red pearl and sparkle. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered the lips with smooth, even color. The texture wasn‚Äôt completely smooth‚ÄìI could tell it had a ton of shimmer in it‚Äìbut it glided on without tugging and didn‚Äôt feel gritty or rough on the lips. It wore well for over six hours, left a reddish stain behind, and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
CHANEL,OMBRES LAM√©ES DE CHANEL,Palette,"undeniably more intricate and stunning upon arrival than most powders, but the question is whether the product‚Äìonce the overspray is removed‚Äìactually lives up to the three digit price tag. There are six narrow strips with different designs, but there are actually only three unique shades. I wish the colors were contained with two strips in a row, rather than alternating, because it would make each area about a third of the pan and totally usable with a brush. It doesn‚Äôt work as well as average-sized eye brushes and is one better suited for detail brushes or if you don‚Äôt mind mixing shades.",B-
LORAC,TAILS & TOP HATS,Palette,"seven eyeshadows housed in a slim, cardboard palette with a mirror under the lid. While it seemed compact, it contained quite a bit of product! I was more impressed by this palette than I anticipated, as the eyeshadows were pigmented with soft, blendable textures and lasted a decent length of time. The formula runs thinner and soft enough that it can be dusty, so it will wear longer over a primer for sure, but I didn‚Äôt have any trouble getting pigmentation or applying them without primer.",B
LORAC,BLACK TIE ATTIRE,Palette,"even eyeshadows housed in a slim, cardboard palette with a mirror under the lid. While it seemed compact, it contained quite a bit of product! I was more impressed by this palette than I anticipated, as the eyeshadows were pigmented with soft, blendable textures and lasted a decent length of time. The formula runs thinner and soft enough that it can be dusty, so it will wear longer over a primer for sure, but I didn‚Äôt have any trouble getting pigmentation or applying them without primer.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,MAKE ME (08),Palette,"a slim lip color with a twist-up ‚ÄúLip Shaper,‚Äù where the lip color hides in the base of the component. The duo features a deeper, muted plum with warmer undertones and a lighter, cooler plum lip pencil (I don‚Äôt think they match that well, actually).",C
MAC,I GET SO OOC,Lipstick,"a deep, plummy brown with subtle, warm undertones and gold, red, and pink pearl. It had semi-opaque color coverage that went on evenly and smoothly. The consistency was soft, lightly emollient, and didn‚Äôt tug on the lips when applied directly from the tube. The color lasted for four hours on me.",B+
MAC,NEW OMBRE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark peach with warm, orange undertones and a matte finish. It had a smooth, velvety texture that glided across the lips fairly well with minimal tugging/dragging. It was easy to use along the outer edge of the lips, and it was definitely doable to fill in my lips with it entirely. The texture was thin, a little tacky, but it didn‚Äôt feel immediately drying. This shade lasted for seven hours but did eventually feel drying on me.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,NICHOLAS,Lipstick,"a very deep red‚Äìalmost burgundy‚Äìwith a semi-matte finish. This shade was one of the most matte finishes in the line-up. It had mostly opaque coverage with a firmer texture, but it did not drag or pull on the lips‚Äìit was just creamy enough not to do so. The color was still going strong after six hours of wear, and it left behind a strong stain. The formula was neither drying nor hydrating to me.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,RYAN,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, reddish plum with warm red and copper pearl. It had semi-opaque color coverage, which applied fairly evenly and didn‚Äôt sink into lip lines quite as noticeably as some of the other shades in the post‚Äìbut it wasn‚Äôt perfect by any means. The texture had some slip, which gave it a glossier finish but also made it more prone to settling. This shade wore for four and a half hours and was moisturizing.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,INIGO,Lipstick,"a deep plum with subtle, cool undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a moderately emollient consistency‚Äìthis color was one of the more slippery shades within the newer shades, so if you‚Äôre prone to feathering/bleeding lip color, this is one you might pair with a liner or skip. I did not experience either myself, though. The texture seemed to cause a lot more color to gather in my lip lines as well. The color lasted for five hours and left a stain behind, while the formula felt hydrating.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,A/W '16,Palette,"a slim lip color with a twist-up ‚ÄúLip Shaper,‚Äù where the lip color hides in the base of the component. The duo has a very light beige lipstick paired with a very light beige lip pencil (with sparkle), and the two are very similar in color and undertone.",D+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,THOMAS,Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. The pigmentation was rich and covered the lips with smooth, opaque color. The texture was less forgiving compared to other shades in the range, which I expect is partially due to the more matte finish, and it seemed more prone to making my lip lines apparent. It lasted for just over five hours, left a subtle stain behind, but some of the color seemed to gather in my lip lines over time.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,CHRISTOPHER,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark plum with warm, brown undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was great‚Äìtotally opaque‚Äìwhile the lipstick felt smooth, moderately creamy, and glided on with ease. The color wore well for five hours on me, and the formula felt somewhat hydrating overall.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,BEN,Lipstick,"a deep, plummy brown with warm, reddish undertones and a semi-matte finish. The consistency was lightly creamy, almost velvet-like as it had a bit of density to it, but it was never heavy. It had rich, opaque color payoff that applied evenly and smoothly. This shade wore well for six hours and was a touch hydrating.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,DOMINIC,Lipstick,"an incredibly deep red with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a creamy, almost velvet-like texture that wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin and felt comfortable on the lips while still having less shine. It seemed more emollient than it looked! This shade was still going strong after seven hours of wear and was hydrating the whole time.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,TRAVIS,Lipstick,"a deep, reddish brown with fine copper and gold pearl. The reddish tone made it a little more unique, while the shimmer gave it an element that a lot of deeper browns lack, so it wasn‚Äôt as dupable as other shades have been. It was semi-opaque, and the texture was moderately emollient with some slip but did not slide around or feather while worn. I noticed a touch of color gathered in my deepest lip line (center, bottom lip) but not so much in the other lines. It wore well for four and a half hours and was moisturizing over time.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,GRAHAM,Lipstick,"a golden peach with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. While there were several shimmery shades in the new line-up, I thought this one had one of the more metallic finishes in the range. It had semi-opaque color payoff with a fairly smooth‚Äìa touch of the shimmer was noticeable when applied‚Äìbut felt smooth once on, almost like it thickened a bit and hid the texture of the shimmer. The color wore well for four hours but some color pulled into my lip lines over time.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,DEVIL INSIDE (06),Lipstick,"a slim lip color with a twist-up lip pencil, where the lip color hides in the base of the lip pencil. The duo features a bright, coral-red with warm, orange undertones and a matching lip liner that runs a little lighter and redder with gold sparkle.",C+
SMASHBOX,BLACK CHERRY,Lipstick,"a deep berry with a hint of cool, red undertones and a natural sheen. There was very, very fine shimmer throughout, but it was sparse and only gave it greater luminosity but did not make it appear pearly, frosted, or metallic. It had semi-opaque, even coverage, which gave it a lip-stained-like appearance as the translucency was noticeable but even.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,I'LL TEACH YOU (05),Palette,"a slim lip color with a twist-up ‚ÄúLip Shaper,‚Äù where the lip color hides in the base of the component. It‚Äôs one of the brighter, deeper duos in the range, and it features a raspberry pink lipstick and a lighter, much cooler pink lip liner.",B-
MAKEUP GEEK,MIDNIGHT SUN,Highlighter,"a soft, light-medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic finish. It had the type of finish that was very reflective, but it was so smooth that it did not seem to emphasize my pores or my skin‚Äôs natural texture.",A
COLOUR POP,SCHOOL IS FUN,Blush,"a very light gold with warm, yellow undertones and a pearly sheen. It had a subtle finish on the skin, as it had semi-sheer, buildable coverage (up to semi-opaque) and definitely did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture or look shiny/metallic. The texture was smooth, moderately emollient with some wetness to the touch, and blended out nicely on the skin. It lasted for eight and a half hours on me.",B+
COLOUR POP,COIN PURSE,Blush,"a bright, medium fuchsia pink with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. The texture was smooth, sponge-like, and felt denser (and a little drier, but I wouldn‚Äôt describe it as dry) compared to a lot of the other shades in the Super Shock Cheek range. It had rich color payoff when applied with fingertips‚Äìas expected based on the brand‚Äôs claims‚Äìbut blended out fairly readily and without too much work. The texture was easier to use over bare skin than over a base (like foundation), though. It wore well for eight and a half hours on me before fading.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,ELECTRIFY,Highlighter,"a bright, very lite white with a reflective, golden sheen. This shade had one of the stronger white bases, so it was one that I think is going to be better for very fair skin tones or layered over a bolder blush/bronzer when used on other skin tones to avoid the white base lightening the skin. It seemed to have less of a shine compared to other shades, too, but I‚Äôd still describe it as a moderate highlighter.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,FLING IT ON (02),Palette,"a slim lip color with a twist-up ‚ÄúLip Shaper,‚Äù where the lip color hides in the base of the component. It features a medium, pink-coral lipstick with a lighter, brighter pink-coral lip liner with gold sparkle.",B
CLARINS,BROWN (03),Palette,"four powder eyeshadows that are supposed to be usable both wet and dry and have long-wearing results. I think that, despite being a neutral palette, it is not quite as dupable as is typical, because there is a lot less warmth coming from orange tones. It‚Äôs also more subdued, which may make it an easy to wear palette for some.",B
MAC,BARE END/EARTHNUT,Palette,"a light-medium, pearly gold on one end and then a medium, warm brown on the other end. The gold seems ideal for highlighting, while the darker shade could be used to bronze or contour (on warmer skin tones). This one applied a bit better and lasted a touch longer than some of the other duos, but it‚Äôs still faster to wear away than most powder blushes on me.",B
COLOUR POP,HONEYMOON,Highlighter,"a very light, bright white with iridescent shimmer that shifted from aqua blue to violet. It was very, very glittery, and on the skin, it looked like sparse glitter that applied with little rhyme or reason. I felt like there was no real sheen or highlighting effect, just random sparkle. The texture felt smoother than it looked, and it didn‚Äôt seem like it was going to have such a translucent, barely-there base. There was definite fall out during the day, though what little ‚Äúsheen‚Äù I saw lasted for eight hours.",C-
COLOUR POP,OVER THE MOON,Highlighter,"a very light lavender with a cooler, white base and flecks of pink and lavender sparkle. It had sheer coverage that wasn‚Äôt buildable, and it did not seem to matter whether I applied with fingertips or a brush‚Äìit was always sheer. The base seemed to be nearly translucent on the skin, and the effect was mostly glitter/sparkle with little sheen. Some of the ‚Äúsheen‚Äù lasted for eight hours, but a lot of the sparkle had migrated or gotten lost during the day.",C-
COLOUR POP,PERILUNE,Highlighter,"a light, greenish-gold with warm undertones and a sparkling sheen. This shade had a stronger base color, though it was still sheer to semi-sheer (even applied with fingertips). It also had less larger sparkle, so it produced more of a noticeable sheen and actually highlighted the skin. The texture was soft, lightly wet, and blendable on the skin and did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. This shade wore well for eight hours with some sparkle that had migrated over time.",C+
CLARINS,ROSEWOOD (02),Palette,"a sultry set of smoky, mauve shades housed in a gold-hued compact. If the name sounds familiar, it‚Äôs because this an updated, reformulated version, except the colors are more different than not from what I‚Äôve seen (I don‚Äôt recall having the original). The formula is a wet/dry formulation that‚Äôs supposed to be long-wearing.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,DAYBREAK,Highlighter,"a light-medium peachy orange with warm, yellow undertones and a luminous sheen. This had a nearly metallic sheen, but it was very smooth and reflective without emphasizing my skin‚Äôs natural texture or the look of my pores (I was rather surprised!). A little went a long way, so I would recommend using a fan brush to get a sheen without blinding everyone near you!",A
MAKEUP GEEK,CELESTIAL,Highlighter,"a very light, icy lavender with cool undertones and a luminous sheen. The finish was somewhere between luminous and metallic, but the shimmer seemed very fine and had a smoother look, so it did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. I didn‚Äôt notice much of a shift with this one‚Äìit always looked icy and purplish.",A
GUERLAIN,COQUE D'OR (03),Palette,"a mix of beige, gold, bronze, brown, and green. This was one of the better performing palettes that Guerlain released, though I think the colors are more dupable than not, so at this price point, I would expect near perfection. It was a mix of textures, most of them underwhelming, but a few shades had better pigmentation. The wear was still problematic with shorter wear times than average.",C-
HUDA BEAUTY,ROSE GOLD,Palette,"eighteen eyeshadows with a mix of matte and metallic finishes across mostly warm-toned hues. The metallic eyeshadows are very, very dense, with some being drier and dense and others being creamier and dense. The ones that were drier tended to yield chunkier pieces of product that were difficult to apply to the lid, even using fingers as recommended by the brand. They had a tendency to emphasize the texture of my lid, which made the area appear more wrinkled and thicker/uneven. I was able to apply the metallic shades with a damp, flat synthetic brush (MAC‚Äôs 242) as well as with fingertips (but the brush gave me a lot more precision). Some shades lasted around eight hours while a few were more prone to fallout and creasing after six hours of wear.",C-
MAC,ALL AFLUSH/HERE YOU GO,Palette,"a gold-shimmered plum and a deeper, red-berry. This is one of the deeper, darker duos in the line-up, so it should be wearable by a lot of skin tones and complexions.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,GLITZ,Highlighter,"a light lavender with a hint of pink paired with a frosted sheen. It‚Äôs a very light highlighter, so it seems like it will suit fairer complexions rather well without adding a lot of color. I think it can be layered over blushes to add shimmer and shine, though.",A
ESTEE LAUDER,HOT CHILLS (310),Lipstick,"a medium-dark orange with warm, red undertones and fine, coppery gold pearl. It had medium color coverage with a lightly glossy finish and moderate slip. The texture was thinner without feeling clingy or wearing away easily. It wore well for four and a half hours and was nicely moisturizing over time. There was a touch of color that sat in my lip lines but wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance as the color blended in with the lip color.",A-
ESTEE LAUDER,DROP DEAD RED (320),Lipstick,"a bold, bright, medium-dark red with subtle, warm undertones and fine red pearl. It appeared darker applied than it seemed swatched. The texture was light-medium in feel and weight, so it covered evenly and didn‚Äôt drag when applied, but it didn‚Äôt feel clingy or thin. This shade had semi-opaque color coverage that wore for six hours and left behind a stain.",A-
ESTEE LAUDER,BAD ANGEL (330),Lipstick,"a muted, light-medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a soft, pearly sheen. It was surprisingly pigmented‚Äìone of the most pigmented in the range with nearly opaque coverage‚Äìwith a thicker, creamier texture that was heavier in look but never actually felt heavy or uncomfortable on the lips. This shade wore well for four and a half hours and was moisturizing over time.",A-
GUERLAIN,ROSE BARBARE (01),Palette,"a pink and purple themed palette that contains five shades. I‚Äôm beyond disappointed in the formula that Guerlain created for their more recently released eyeshadow palettes; it is just so powdery, dusty, dry, and hard to use. I used it over primer, and it was still a total pain to apply and looked uneven, patchy, and faded. I felt like primer just made the mess wear longer, but it did little to make it look better, and I did try several types of primer. The only base that worked decently was a tackier, slightly wet base, which gave the powdery formula more to cling to.",D-
MAC,SHOW GOLD,Highlighter,"a light, yellowed peach base with shimmer that shifts from pink to golden peach with a more sparkling, metallic finish.",B
CLE DE PEAU,LES ANNEES FOLLES,Palette,"a new, limited edition holiday palette that features eight eyeshadows. Each row of eyeshadows is actually removeable and can be put into one of the brand‚Äôs quad compacts. The formula was very finely-milled, but it was so soft that it was prone to sheering out as it was a little thin and dusty, though the formula blended well on the skin. If you‚Äôre someone who wants very true-to-pan color and intense coverage that lasts, you‚Äôll likely be disappointed with this palette. If you‚Äôre someone who likes softer, more muted takes on color and doesn‚Äôt mind using an eyeshadow primer, it might be more in your wheelhouse (but it is undoubtedly expensive, so there are numerous other options that are more versatile‚Äìe.g. capable of delivering intense pigmentation but can also be sheered down).",C
MAC,BEAMING BLUSH,Highlighter,"a light, subtly warm-toned pink base with a gold and pink shimmer.",B
BITE BEAUTY,MAUVEMBER 2016,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark pinky plum with cooler undertones and a satin finish.",A
MAC,SMOKY EYE COMPACT,Palette,"a warm-toned, neutral eyeshadow palette with nine shades. There are some nicer shades in the palette, but there are also some real misses, and at this price point, that makes it far less enticing. There are better neutral palettes out there, especially of the warm-toned variety.",B-
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,THE LEGENDARY MUSE,Palette,"a warm-toned set of mid-tone shades in light-medium copper, medium-dark gold, light-medium gold, and rosy brown. I liked it overall, though all of the shades are dupable, so it might be redundant in some stashes but may also be an easy go-to for others. I would have liked to have seen one deeper shade with less shimmer, which would have offered more contrast.",B
CHANEL,POUDRE LUMIERE GLACEE,Highlighter,"a very light white with subtle, cooler undertones and a smattering of white sparkle.",D
MAC,COOL EYE COMPACT,Palette,"nine eyeshadows in ‚Äúcool‚Äù hues, which was comprised mostly of pinks with a couple of grays and mauves. It‚Äôs not the worst palette I‚Äôve seen from MAC, but it‚Äôs not a good palette at this price point either.",C
CHANEL,ROSE GLACIER (170),Blush,"a bright, medium pink with warm undertones and gold shimmer.",B+
NATASHA DENONA,STAR,Palette,"18 eyeshadows, all of them new, with a combination of four finishes. There are two new finishes: Creamy Matte (CM), which is supposed to an improved version of the matte formula, and Crystal (K), which is supposed to have a ‚Äúsparkling, star-like shimmer.‚Äù The brand‚Äôs eyeshadows are supposed to be ‚Äúlong-lasting‚Äù with ‚Äústrong color payoff‚Äù that ‚Äúwill not crease‚Äù and ‚Äúeasily adhere to the eye‚Äìwithout having to use primer.‚Äù The Creamy Matte formula is denser than the regular Matte formula, and it seemed to be more pigmented with less sheering out, but they tended to darken on the skin and did not layer as well with each other. Two shades were almost clumpy in texture (Phoenix, Electra) and were messy to use‚Äìeven over primer, they were extremely difficult to build up or blend out without using lighter shades to help. The Crystal formula has large, chunky sparkle, which didn‚Äôt really bind with the base color, so there is a lot of fall out during application and moderate fall out during wear (less than anticipated, actually).",B-
MAC,DOUBLE-GLEAM,Highlighter,"a light gold with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic sheen.",A-
CHANEL,ROSE TOURBILLON (67),Blush,"a bright, medium-dark pink with subtle, cool undertones and a soft pearl finish.",A-
TARTE,TARTEIST PRO,Palette,"20 eyeshadows with 16 shades that are matte and 4 that are shimmery. The matte eyeshadows felt smoother and a little denser with less powderiness/dustiness compared to the Tartelette palettes, but they are still rather soft and have slight dustiness overall. The shimmery eyeshadows were soft, smooth, and denser, but they did not seel as velvety or as dense compared to the Metallics Shadow range (and the ingredient lists seemed different). I think the palette is pretty good, particularly if you normally use an eyeshadow primer, as the mattes all really benefit from it in minor ways that make them much easier to use and longer-wearing.",B
SURRATT BEAUTY,LA ROS√©E DU SOIR,Blush,"muted, medium brown with hints of warm, rosy undertones paired with a satin finish. ",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,OBJECT OF DESIRE,Palette,"three cheek colors and six eyeshadows. They are in a gold, zippered case with a large, black tassel. As far as traveling goes, the upside is that it is rather cushioned and shouldn‚Äôt break easily, but it is thicker than most palettes. Some of the shades were decent, others were below average; it‚Äôs not a palette that seems worthy of splurging on for the holidays as a result. Those with several neutral palettes may find that this palette is rather repetitive. I did like that the cheek colors coordinated with the eye products, at least.",B-
SURRATT BEAUTY,CLASSIQUE,Blush,"a bright, bold pinky-red with cooler undertones and a satin finish. ",A+
TARTE,PRETTY PAINTBOX,Palette,"24 eyeshadows, four cheek colors, miniature size Glossy Lip Paint, black liquid eyeliner, and miniature sized mascara. It‚Äôs another middling mega set from Tarte-it‚Äôs disappointing with some real misses in the palette. There were only a few shades that were actually good. The set itself is contained within a zippered case, but it is pretty bulky for traveling (and storing). The best part about the set were the punny art-inspired names.",C+
MAC,NUDE,Palette,"four miniature-sized Patentpolish Lip Pencils, which are supposed to have the color and ‚Äúsheen of a gloss with the precision of a lip pencil.‚Äù The formula is also supposed to be hydrating. The texture of the formula is smooth, lightly creamy, and emollient, so it feels thinner and more balm-like on the lips, which makes for a hydrating formula overall, but it tends to have short wear time. Of all MAC‚Äôs lip kits, this one seems to be short on value, too.",C+
DIOR,GREGE 1947 (169),Lipstick,"a soft, light-medium coral with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque color payoff that went on evenly. The consistency was soft, lightly creamy, lightweight, and emollient, so there was a lot of slip, which made it comfortable to wear and more balm-like on. The downside was that it moved around more, and the wear time only came in at three and a half hours for me. It was very hydrating, though. ",C
DIOR,ROSE CAPRICE (475),Lipstick,"a bright, medium fuchsia pink with cooler, violet pearl. It had semi-sheer color coverage, which applied well enough, but it could have been a bit more even overall. The consistency was thin, balmy, and comfortable to wear as it glided right on and didn‚Äôt cling to the lips. It lasted for three and a half hours on me and was hydrating. ",D
DIOR,DARLING (775),Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark fuchsia-red with subtle, warm undertones and a luminous finish. The consistency was smooth, lightly emollient, and applied easily and did not tug on my lips. It had good pigmentation, though not fully opaque, that went on evenly. This shade lasted for six hours and left a stain behind, and the formula was moisturizing over time. ",B-
MAC,NUDE,Palette,"three Cremesheen Glasses and one Dazzleglass in variations on ‚Äúnude.‚Äù Cremesheen Glass is supposed to be creamy, hydrating, and sheerer. Dazzleglass is supposed to have medium coverage with a hydrating, non-tacky formula filled with lots of shimmer/sparkle. In general, Cremesheen Glass tends to have a creamier, milkier quality to it, which makes it comfortable and hydrating to wear, but it often looks streaky, settles into lip lines, and is shorter wearing. Dazzleglass is moderately tacky, thicker, and wears longer and has tons of sparkle, but it is more semi-sheer in coverage. What I‚Äôve always found funny about the holiday gloss sets is that they‚Äôre called ‚Äúminis,‚Äù but they‚Äôre larger than full-size.",B-
NARS,SHADOW SIDE,Palette,"three miniature sized twist-up cream eyeshadows and a miniature sized mascara. I haven‚Äôt had great luck with the Velvet Shadow Stick formula, as they are harder to blend and work with on the lid and have shorter-wear (five to six hours). They tend to work best for me as an eyeshadow base rather than as a standalone eyeshadow, though the shades that are closer to the skin tone and have some pearl are the easiest to use as-is. My experience with these three was consistent with past experience‚Äìshorter wear and harder to blend and even out on the skin.",C-
NARS,GIVE IN TAKE,Palette,"six eyeshadows and three blushes in the Dual-Intensity formula. The Dual-Intensity Eyeshadow formula is supposed to be sheerer when applied dry and more opaque with a ‚Äúhigh-impact finish‚Äù when used damp. The Dual-Intensity Blush formula is supposed to have a ‚Äúhigh-impact‚Äù flush when used damp and a ‚Äúnatural-looking glow‚Äù when used dry. In general, regardless of whether it‚Äôs an eyeshadow or blush, they are sheer to semi-opaque with more of a frosted, shimmery finish when used dry, and then more opaque and more metallic when used damp. The blushes can be more difficult to blend and diffuse when used damp, but I don‚Äôt have that issue (or at least, not as often) with the eyeshadows applied with a damp brush‚ÄìI expect this is partially due to how blush is often applied at sheerer coverage levels than eyesahdow, so it is more obvious when it is not diffusing as readily. Both formulas wear between six and nine hours for me.",B
BITE BEAUTY,BRONZE/PEPPER,Palette,"the most dramatic layered result of the duos, as the coppery top coat really changes the color of the rosy plum lipstick quite a bit. If you like more metallic, pigmented color, you may also find that this duo is better suited for wearing the metallic shade alone, as it did over a lot more coverage.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,BLACQUER (000),Lipstick,"a deep black with neutral undertones and a cream finish. It was intensely pigmented‚Äìone of the most pigmented shades in the range that I‚Äôve tried‚Äìwith a creamy, easy-to-apply texture that glided over the lips and spread the color evenly across the lips. It wore well for six and a half hours, but it was a bit drying after four hours of wear.",B+
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,BAD BEHAVIOR,Lipstick,"a dark burgundy with warm, brown undertones and a satin sheen. It had mostly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly. The texture was lightly creamy, light-medium in weight, and didn‚Äôt drag or tug on the lips. The color wore well for seven hours, left a slight stain behind, and was a touch drying after four hours of wear. ",B
BITE BEAUTY,ROSE GOLD/FIG,Palette,"a well-paired set of shades, as it creates a warm, rosy lip that can be shimmery or satin-like, depending on whether you layer the two shades. I liked both shades, and I felt Fig was consistent with the permanent version I had in wear and color.",A-
COLOUR POP,STUDIO 1400,Palette,"four cream eyeshadows. You can also purchase the shades individually if all four do not appeal to you. I‚Äôve always liked the Super Shock Shadow formula, because when it‚Äôs good, it‚Äôs really good‚Äìpigmented, long-wearing, and blendable. They are a cream formula, and I find it works best with flat, synthetic brushes over fluffier brushes, though I‚Äôll use a fluffier brush for crease work or blending.",A+
BITE BEAUTY,GOLD/SOUR CHERRY,Palette,"a holiday party duo if I‚Äôve seen one‚Äìa gold, glimmering top coat paired with a rich, ruby red. The richness of the Amuse Bouche formula can overwhelm the shimmer if applied directly from the tube (the shimmer was noticeable, but it appeared ruby in hue‚Äìbut it did result in a gorgeous, ruby red slippers kind of effect), but I had better success patting it on over the red color with a fingertip to make the gold shimmer standout more.",A
URBAN DECAY,FULL SPECTRUM,Palette,"21 eyeshadows (each is 0.04 oz.) in a variety of rainbow-inspired hues. It‚Äôs a new, limited edition palette for the holidays. While it has some similarity to last year‚Äôs Spectrum palette, the packaging is different‚Äìthe lid now is hinged and lifts off of the palette, rather than fully removes (which is a complaint often made about last year‚Äôs palette!)‚Äìand it also contains more eyeshadows (21 vs. 15). If you normally use a primer or don‚Äôt mind using a white base to get the most bang out of the eyeshadows in the palette, you might enjoy it. On the other hand, if you want intense, totally opaque coverage in one pass, this might leave you wanting more as there are several shades that are either sheerer, dustier, or a combination of both. The palette launches on October 26th at Urban Decay and will follow shortly to other retailers after that.",C+
LORAC,CUE THE CONFETTI,Palette,"four full-sized blushes/highlighters. The three blushes are part of the permanent range, while the highlighter is a limited edition shade. The Color Source Buildable Blush formula is supposed to offer‚Äìyou guessed it‚Äìbuildable color coverage with a ‚Äúsilky-smooth‚Äù consistency available in matte and satin finishes. The Light Source Illuminating Highlighter formula is supposed to be buildable for both a ‚Äúsoft, natural sheen‚Äù or ‚Äúlayered for a high-shine, dramatic effect.‚Äù The four shades in the palette weren‚Äôt what I‚Äôd call buildable; they are very pigmented with a light to moderate touch of the brush to the pan‚Äìwhich will be a happy thing for someone who likes more pigmented cheek colors. The texture was soft, smooth, and blendable across all four shades, and they lasted between seven and eight and a half hours on me. The brush is smaller than the average blush brush, but it didn‚Äôt seem too small (like it would take a lot of work to apply and blend over the cheek area), and it was fairly soft with only a few bristles that seemed out of place.",B+
CHANEL,ROUGE TROUBLANT (60),Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark pinky-coral with warm undertones and a very subtle pearl that gave it more of a satin finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage that applied evenly, but some of the color sat in lip lines and emphasized them. The consistency was thinner and clung more noticeably, so I don‚Äôt think it was the most flattering finish overall. This shade lasted for five and a half hours and was lightly drying over time.",B+
CHANEL,ROUGE REBELLE (172),Lipstick,"a bright, medium red with neutral-to-warm undertones and fine pearl. It had semi-opaque color coverage, which applied evenly and smoothly without tugging on the lips. The consistency was thin, lightweight, comfortable to wear, and felt lightly hdyrating. This shade wore for five hours on me and left behind a subtle stain.",A-
CHANEL,ROUGE ANGELIQUE (174),Lipstick,"a muted, medium rosy brown with warm undertones and a satin finish. It was nearly opaque in pigmentation, but the consistency was heavier and a touch thicker than most of the Rouge Allure range‚Äìyou can even see how it had less sheen and luminosity in its finish. There was some color that pulled into lip lines, but the color was close enough to my natural lip color that it wasn‚Äôt as noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The color wore well for four hours and was lightly hydrating.",B+
MAC,YUM YUM YUM,Blush,"a medium pink with subtle, cool undertones and gold sparkle over a satin finish. ",D
MAC,SWEET VISION,Blush,"a medium-dark pink with warm undertones and a gold, frosted shimmer. ",A
CHANEL,LUXURIANT (150),Lipstick,"a muted, pinky-red with cool undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff that applied smoothly and evenly. It was one of the better-applying shades I tried. The texture was lightweight, water-like initially but dried down to a comfortable, thin, and smooth consistency that didn‚Äôt slide around but didn‚Äôt feel tacky or clingy either. The color wore just over six and a half hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
CHANEL,EXPERIMENTE (154),Lipstick,"a dark red with warm, brick undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that spread easily across the lips and covered evenly. The texture felt thin and more water-like initially, but it dried down after thirty minutes to a semi-matte finish that was comfortable to wear. It wore for six hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
MAC,RETROGRADE,Eyeshadow,"a deep gray with cooler, bluish pearl. It had good color coverage with a soft, silky texture, but I noticed that some of the color would stick more readily to some areas, and then it would not want to diffuse much from there, so the end result was somewhat patchy. I had better luck when I used it over a primer getting more even intensity but did not experience easier blending. It started to crease after seven and a half hours of wear on bare lids, and it had no signs of wear with primer after nine and a half hours.",B+
MAC,APHRODISIATIC,Eyeshadow,"a deep, blackened navy blue with lighter medium blue pearl that gives is a more pearlized finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a fine, smooth consistency that was soft to the touch but had a tendency to sheer out a bit on the lid and look a bit uneven. I highly recommend using it over a primer as a result, which helped even out the coverage a lot. The color lasted for seven hours before creasing on me, and it had no signs of wear with primer after nine and a half hours.",B+
MAC,BLUE KARMA,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark green-leaning teal with subtle, cool undertones and warmer green-gold and bluish-teal pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly, but it had a translucency that made it appear faded and more subdued. The consistency was soft, felt velvety in the pot, and it blended out fairly well on the lid. It wore well for just over seven and a half hours, and it had no signs of wear with primer after nine and a half hours.",B+
MAC,COSMIC CLASH,Eyeshadow,"a blackened brown with cooler, emerald green pearl that gives it a slightly metallic finish overall. It had medium coverage, which was somewhat buildable, but I struggled to get true-to-pan intensity without using a damp brush or patting it on two to three layers over a primer. The color was harder to blend out evenly and tended to look patchy and dotty over bare skin as some product stuck and did not want to budge, and it was somewhat improved over primer but still finnicky. It wore well for seven and a half hours on me, and it had no signs of wear with primer after nine and a half hours.",B-
NARS,THOUSAND WORLDS,Palette,"two miniature sized Audacious Lipsticks (both brand new shades) and two miniature sized Nail Polishes (also new shades). I‚Äôm so bummed about this set, because both polishes were problematic and lacking (and for high-end polish, it really should perform, given how many excellent options exist at lower price points), while the Audacious Lipsticks were fantastic‚Äìand new shades at that! This was one of the few sets that had more distinctive packaging, too, and it had a frosted plastic clamshell with a staggered edge that opened to reveal the products.",B+
ANASTASIA,ULTIMATE GLOW,Palette,"six highlighters in a gold-hued theme. This palette is going to be best suited for someone who likes more over-the-top highlighters that run glittery, sparkling, and/or metallic and doesn‚Äôt mind if the texture of their skin is emphasized by their highlighter. The formula on some of the highlighters is rather dense, so airier, fluffier brushes did not work well with it‚ÄìI felt like a denser or even a flat, synthetic brush worked better to get both color and shimmer out of the product. The more feathery brushes I tried tended to grab more of the sparkle and frost content than color, which resulted in a more uneven application.",B
NARS,INDES GALANTES,Palette,"a dark, smoky duo of shades featuring a shimmery gray and matte burgundy. I wasn‚Äôt a fan of either shades, as they were both harder to apply and blend out. It is an interesting combo of shades, though, so there is that!",C+
DIOR,PRECIOUS EMBROIDERY (776),Palette,"a new, limited edition five-pan eyeshadow palette that features a mauve, pinky-white, golden beige, deep brown, and blackened plum. The formula feels like last year‚Äôs holiday eyeshadow formula, which was a little easier to use and better performing than some of Dior‚Äôs other eyeshadow palettes in recent times. It is described as being ‚Äúultra-pigmented‚Äù with ‚Äù no powdery effect.‚Äù Overall, the palette had good pigmentation with a slightly drier, lightly dusty consistency that was blendable but more prone to sheering out when working with it on the lid. They would perform better with a primer, which would give them a better base to adhere to as well as extend the wear.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,BANDWAGON,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium taupe brown with neutral-to-warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff that was buildable to mostly opaque coverage on the lid. The consistency was soft, thin and a bit dusty, but it blended well and didn‚Äôt fade quickly. It lasted for eight hours on me.",B
MAKEUP GEEK,FAUX FUR,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark taupe with neutral-to-cool undertones and a matte finish. The pigmentation was opaque, while the texture was blendable and maintained its intensity on the lid‚Äìa smidgen dusty overall‚Äìbut soft and finely-milled. It applied well to bare skin, and it wore for eight hours.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,CABIN FEVER,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark reddish-brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was very soft, but it was dustier and had more excess product kicked up in the pan. The color was buildable on the lid but more prone to sheering out, so it was hard to get and keep opaque coverage without a primer in place. This shade wore well for seven and a half hours on me. ",B-
MAKEUP GEEK,EARLY BIRD,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium orange with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had great pigmentation, but the texture was powdery, despite being soft to the touch. It blended well on the skin, but it had a tendency to sheer out and look somewhat faded on bare skin, so this is another shade that I would only use with a primer. It lasted for seven hours before fading noticeably.",B
BURBERRY,THE RUNWAY PALETTE,Highlighter,"a light-medium, yellow gold with warm undertones and a luminous sheen.",B+
GUERLAIN,SHALIMAR,Palette,"a limited edition set of shades for the holiday season. Guerlain‚Äôs weakness seems to be eyeshadows, unfortunately, and the holiday duo left much to be desired. The formula is supposed to be ‚Äúultra-pigmented‚Äù with ‚Äúmultiple metallic reflections.‚Äù The consistency of the top shade was dry, slightly gritty, and extremely difficult to blend, while the bottom shade was looser and easier to work with but had fall out (and is, between the two, quite dupable).",C
ANASTASIA,FALL 2016,Palette,"six, miniature-sized glosses in six, new and exclusive shades. I‚Äôm a big fan of Anastasia‚Äôs gloss formula for something more pigmented, longer wearing, and hydrating over time. On the whole, the set is nice‚Äìthe colors are very autumnal, and for the most part, they applied well, had good color coverage, and were moisturizing and comfortable to wear.",A-
COLOUR POP,BARDOT,Blush,"described as a ‚Äúrusty red copper.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, coppery red with warm, red-orange undertones and fine pinky-red and gold shimmer.",A
ESTEE LAUDER,BITTER CLOVE,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium-dark golden blackened-brown with larger, gold flecks of sparkle and shimmer that has a more metallic finish. It was intensely pigmented with a dense, cream-like texture that blended and adhered well to the lid. The color started to crease faintly after six hours of wear.",B+
ESTEE LAUDER,CHARRED EMERALD,Eyeshadow,"a deep, blackened teal with subtle, cool undertones and a pearly sheen. The pigmentation was fantastic and was easy to apply to the skin. While it was intense on the lid initially, I noticed that the brightness seemed to fade within a few minutes, and it had more of a blackened look. From there, the color wore well for six hours before it started to crease on me.",B
CLINIQUE,BLACK HONEY POP,Blush,a medium-dark pinky plum with warm undertones and a luminous finish.,A+
CLINIQUE,PINK HONEY POP,Blush,"is a soft, light-medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and a satin sheen.",A
ESTEE LAUDER,MODERN MERCURY,Highlighter,"a light-medium, rosy brown with warm undertones and soft pink and gold shimmer.",A+
ESTEE LAUDER,JAVA SUN,Bronzer,"a muted, medium brown with warm, yellowish undertones and a matte finish.",A
BITE BEAUTY,BLONDIE,Blush,a light-medium peachy brown with warm undertones and a satin finish.,B-
MAC,TECHNO CUMBIA,Palette,"blush duo that features a split-pan with more of the deeper shade (Blunt) and a smaller portion of the lighter shade (Ven Conmigo). The smaller blush is hard to apply on its own, as it doesn‚Äôt accommodate the average blush brush well, and even my smaller blush brushes were too large and I had to pinch the brush head to get it to narrow and fit in the area. This was the weakest product in the collection, so I figured we‚Äôd get it out of the way.",C
BOBBI BROWN,FLAME,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark orange-red with strong, red undertones and a satiny sheen. This shade wasn‚Äôt as glossy as others in the range, but it was still a more luminous finish overall. The texture was smooth, lightly creamy, and glided on easily. It had mostly opaque pigmentation that covered my lips evenly. I was able to wear this for six hours, and it felt moisturizing during that time.",A
BOBBI BROWN,IMPERIAL RED,Lipstick,"a deep red with subtle, cooler, pink undertones and a glossy finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which did apply evenly and smoothly, so it looked like stain glass on the lips as there was still very rich, pronounced color on the lips. The texture was moderately emollient, so it didn‚Äôt tug while I applied, but it had more slip. I did not personally experience feathering or bleeding around the edges of my lips, but the consistency makes me think it might on others more prone to those things. This shade wore well for five and a half hours and left behind a strong stain.",A-
BOBBI BROWN,BOBBI,Lipstick,"a muted, medium pinky-brown with subtle, warm undertones and a creamy finish. The texture was lightweight, smooth, and creamy, so it was easy to apply and comfortable to wear. It had nearly opaque pigmentation, which applied evenly, and lasted a solid four and a half hours on my lips. I felt the formula was lightly hydrating over time.",A
BOBBI BROWN,BAHAMA BROWN,Lipstick,"a muted, medium rosy mauve with warm undertones and a cream finish. The texture was smooth, lightly creamy and glided across the lips without tugging or dragging. It yielded opaque coverage in a single stroke, and despite the slip, the edges were quite crisp and even without work. On my lips, the formula felt hydrating over the five hours this shade lasted for. I noticed very slight color settled into my lip lines after four hours of wear.",A
BOBBI BROWN,UBER ROSE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark plum with subtle, cool undertones and a creamy, lightly glossy finish. This shade had a really smooth, creamy texture that applied rich, opaque coverage comfortably. It‚Äôs the kind of formula you can apply half-asleep, because it‚Äôs rather effortless. It had fully opaque pigmentation that went on evenly and lasted for five hours on me.",A
BOBBI BROWN,TAHITI PINK,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink with warmer undertones and a lightly glossy finish. The texture was more slippery compared to other shades, and it didn‚Äôt have the same cream-like look applied‚Äìthis had subtle translucency and I would get ‚Äúlines‚Äù if I pressed my lips together. I also noticed that color gathered in my lip lines right away, which did worsen over time. The color itself lasted for six hours, left a pinkish stain behind, and was hydrating.",B+
BOBBI BROWN,BELLINI,Lipstick,"a medium, coral-orange with warm undertones and a creamy finish with a light sheen. It had rich, opaque pigmentation with a lightweight, very creamy texture that glided on without tugging on the lips, but it had enough slip that I had trouble with some of the color gathering in lip lines over time. It was comfortable to wear, as the formula was hydrating, over the five hours it lasted.",B+
BOBBI BROWN,UBER BEIGE,Lipstick,"a medium brown with subtle warm, rosy undertones and a creamy finish. The consistency was lightweight, creamy, and felt hydrating on the lips. This shade was richly pigmented and covered the lips with smooth, even color. After two hours of wear, some color slid into my lip lines, though I could press my lips to smooth everything back into place. The color wore well for close to four and a half hours on me.",A-
BOBBI BROWN,BOND,Lipstick,"a deep, muted plum with subtle, warm undertones and a lightly glossy, cream finish. The texture was smooth, lightly creamy, a little thicker overall than the other two shades, which I think helped it fill in lip lines without emphasizing them. The lipstick had opaque color payoff that applied evenly, and the formula was moisturizing over the six hours it lasted for. There was a faint purplish stain left behind.",A
BITE BEAUTY,LOTUS,Blush,"a medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish.",B
BITE BEAUTY,PRALINE,Blush,"a slightly brightened, medium orange with warm undertones and a satin sheen.",B
NARS,UNSPEAKABLE,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark red-plum with warm undertones and a creamy finish. It had nearly opaque color payoff that went on evenly and smoothly. The consistency had the plushness of a gloss with the creaminess of a satin lipstick, so it didn‚Äôt feel heavy or tacky, but it still had noticeable shine. This shade wore well for five hours on me, and it was moisturizing as well.",A
NARS,TOY,Lipgloss,"a deep, purpled burgundy with subtle, warm undertones and a smattering of fine pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which was even for the most part with minor color pulling into lip lines (this was a case where the color was so dark that it was hard to tell from afar). The consistency was lightweight, smooth, a little gel-li,e and comfortable to wear over the five hours it lasted for. The formula felt hydrating to me while worn.",B+
NARS,AREA,Lipgloss,"a deep brown with subtle, warmer undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered the lips with smooth, even color, but some of the natural lip color can come through still. The texture was lightweight, non-tacky, and comfortable to wear on the lips, while a bit of color sat in lip lines and made the ones on my bottom lip a bit more noticeable, though I didn‚Äôt really detect it from a normal viewing distance. This shade stayed on well for four and a half hours and was hydrating.",A-
NARS,DEVIANT,Lipgloss,"a rich, medium-dark reddish plum with subtle, warm undertones and a creamy finish. The texture was smooth, light-to-medium in weight, and spread well across the lips. The formula delivered rich, opaque color coverage that was even and didn‚Äôt pull into lip lines. I was able to wear this shade for just over five hours, and it felt moisturizing to me.",A+
COLOUR POP,FLEXITARIAN,Highlighter,"a light, golden beige with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. The texture was very smooth, moderately emollient, and blendable on bare skin or over my base products. It had medium, buildable coverage when applied with a brush and intense, opaque coverage when I used my fingertips. While it looked very metallic in the pot and swatched, once blended, it had more of a medium shimmer finish. This shade stayed in place for ten hours.",A+
COLOUR POP,MIGHT BE,Highlighter,"a muted, medium-dark rosy copper with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-sheer, buildable pigmentation with opaque coverage easily achieved if applied with fingertips rather than a brush. The texture was more emollient and wetter to the touch compared to the majority of shades in this formula (I would say it is comparable to the equally metallic shades in the eyeshadow formula). It blended out easily and wore well for nine hours.",A
URBAN DECAY,SMOG,Lipstick,"described as a ‚Äúdeep coppery bronze [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, golden bronze with warm undertones and gold, green, and bronze pearl that give it more of a metallic finish. The consistency was creamy, lightly emollient but not too slippery, and glided on with ease. It had nearly opaque coverage that applied smoothly and evenly. This shade wore well for five hours and was moisturizing while worn.",A
URBAN DECAY,ROACH,Lipstick,"described as a ‚Äúdeep burgundy-brown [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, dark brown with warm, reddish undertones and fine bronze shimmer with subtle, multi-colored pearl. It had nearly opaque color payoff that applied fairly evenly, though it slid around somewhat on the lips, so I could see ‚Äúlines‚Äù if I pressed my lips together. The texture was lightweight and comfortable to wear, but it had more slip than other shades in the Cream finish. It wore well for four and a half hours and was hydrating.",A-
URBAN DECAY,BRUISE,Lipstick,"described as a ‚Äúsheer deep burgundy red with green shift [with a Sheer finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a brighter, medium-dark reddish plum with a lightly glossy finish. There‚Äôs a very, very fine bit of bluish-teal pearl, but it‚Äôs barely-there‚ÄìI can‚Äôt really detect a shift, even when just swatched on my arm and twisting it in every different direction. The texture was smooth, moderately emollient that glided on easily and had a wettish feel going on. This shade was lightly hydrating and lasted for five and a half hours, and it left behind a stain.",A
NARS,MINESHAFT,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium red with warm, orange undertones and a cream finish. The texture was smooth, non-sticky, and light-to-medium in weight; it sat well on lips for the most part with just the faintest settling that was visible in the close-up but not in person (without a magnifying mirror). The color was richly pigmented and lasted for five hours while it felt hydrating over time. ",A
NARS,NO. 54,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a cream finish. It had opaque color payoff that applied with smooth, even coverage. The texture was smooth with a little weight (but it wasn‚Äôt heavy) and just slightly emphasized a few of my lip lines, which I could only see close-up. This shade wore well for five hours and was moisturizing while worn.",A
NARS,LE PALACE,Lipgloss,"a deep red with subtle, cool undertones and very fine pearl. It had intense color payoff that applied smoothly and evenly. The texture was smooth, almost gel-like, and easy to spread across the lips and did not well up into my lip lines. This shade wore well for almost five hours and was hydrating over time.",A+
URBAN DECAY,JUNKIE,Palette,"a limited edition palette that includes 12-pans of lipstick with all shades from the brand‚Äôs permanent range of colors. There are two variations available, and between the two palettes, there are three shades that overlap‚Äì714, Big Bang, and Firebird. Junkie is slightly cooler in tone (particularly the second row) and includes a few less ‚Äútraditional‚Äù shades. This palette is exclusive to Sephora and should launch sometime in September (I don‚Äôt have an exact date).",B+
NARS,STRIPPED,Lipgloss,"a light-medium beige with a hint of pink paired with a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, and while it didn‚Äôt appear streaky, the color settled into lip lines noticeably. This was one of the worst performers in the range as a result, even though it felt comfortable to wear over the three and a half hours it lasted.",B-
NARS,UNLACED,Lipgloss,"a soft, light-medium pink with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage that applied without streaking, but some of the color gathered into lip lines. The texture was smooth, lightweight, and non-sticky. The color lasted for three hours on me, but there was more color visible in my lip lines at that point as well.",B-
NARS,PLAYPEN,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that covered evenly and spread easily across the lips. The formula was hydrating, comfortable on the lips, and lasted for four hours on me. There was a slight amount of visible color in lip lines, but it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,BISCOTTI,Blush,"a muted, medium-dark rosy plum with subtle, warm undertones and a natural sheen.",A-
MAC,SPOILED FABULOUS,Lipstick,"a light, champagne gold with warm undertones and fine gold and larger gold sparkle. It had a noticeably gritty texture when applied directly to the lips, and the sparkle really clings to each other, which causes unevenness and lumpy bits of sparkle on the lips. The ‚Äúcolor‚Äù seemed to slip into lip lines as well. This is a shade that I found difficult to apply on its own and get any measure of standalone wear out of it, as it always made my lips look rough and very textured. It would work better as a layering shade. It lasted for two and a half hours on me.",D
MAC,WILD EXTRACT,Lipstick,"a bright, light-medium chartreuse with warm, yellow undertones and a fine, metallic shimmer. There aren‚Äôt that many shades like it, so I really wish this performed better, since it is permanent! The texture was thin, emollient but a little slippery, and it did gather a bit in lip lines. It could have applied more evenly as well and only had medium coverage. The color lasted for three and a half hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",C
MAC,TIME TO SHINE,Lipstick,"a silvery white with a pearly shimmer finish. This was one of the least shimmery shades in the new Frosts being added to the permanent line. It had semi-opaque coverage, but the color did seem to emphasize every lip line by settling into it. I think a lip primer or lip liner might help this one, but I would consider using an invisible lip liner with this one. This shade lasted for three hours and was slightly drying.",C-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,ABOUT LAST NIGHT (240),Palette,"a very large, product-packed palette housed in a bronze-hued plastic compact. Overall, the majority of the eyeshadows were soft, blendable, pigmented, and long-wearing. For a palette with this many shades (and several of them matte!), its performance was impressive. I‚Äôm not, personally, sold on the color combination and didn‚Äôt feel like it was as versatile as last year‚Äôs The Free Spirit palette. If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with the way this palette is arranged, look at the shades as columns, as each column creates a ‚Äúlook.‚Äù",A-
BITE BEAUTY,MASCARPONE,Blush,"a medium, rosy plum with warm undertones and a satin finish.",A-
MAC,CHERRY TOPPED,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium-dark pink with subtle, warm undertones and a sparkly, frosted finish. It had good pigmentation that applied fairly well, but the glittery bits felt grainy and loosened from the base color both in the pan as well as when I blended out the color on the lid. It wore well for eight hours with some fallout.",B
MAC,NICE ENERGY,Eyeshadow,"a bright, light chartreuse with strong, yellow undertones and a pearly sheen‚Äìit is more yellow than green, though it isn‚Äôt truly yellow either! The texture was soft, smooth, and blendable without being too firm or too soft in the pan. The eyeshadow blended out well on the skin and didn‚Äôt sheer out instantly, but the edges were easy to diffuse. On me, the color lasted for eight hours before fading noticeably.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,GELATO,Blush,"a medium, rosy mauve with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish.",B+
SMASHBOX,RED RAGE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark ruby red with strong, pink undertones and fine fuchsia shimmer sprinkled throughout. Though it wasn‚Äôt fully opaque, it covered evenly and smoothly as the lipstick glided on without tugging and sat well without settling into lip lines. The texture was lightweight, thin without being clingy, and comfortable to wear over the six and a half hours this shade lasted. It felt lightly hydrating overall.",A
SMASHBOX,INSPIRATION,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark fuchsia-berry with cool, blue undertones and a dusting of fine, pink pearl. It had semi-opaque color coverage, so some of the natural lip color will come through. The texture was light-medium in weight with a moderately creamy feel‚Äìmore emollient than the average shade in the range‚Äìthat covered well and didn‚Äôt streak. This shade was still wearing well after six hours, and the formula felt lightly hydrating.",A
SMASHBOX,TABLOID,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark purple with warm, pink undertones and a cream finish. Of all the Cream shades, this had the least glossiness, but it definitely wasn‚Äôt matte. The texture was a bit thicker, and it applied without dragging, but it didn‚Äôt sit as well on the lips and emphasized the texture. The color wore well for six hours and was just a bit hydrating overall.",B+
MAC,PRETTY PUNK,Palette,"pops of color, like blue and green, paired with glittery silver and taupe. Whatever formula MAC is using in the shimmers goes too far in the cream department that they‚Äôve become more solidified and difficult to work with‚ÄìI had really had to jab at a few of the shimmery eyeshadows with my brush to get the product to dislodge, while using fingertips did better as they softened the pan of product and made it easier for product to transfer from fingertip to lid.",C
COLOUR POP,CR√®ME DE LA CR√®ME,Palette,"four powder highlighters, which are best characterized as more subtle to moderate highlighters; they‚Äôre not over-the-top at all (definitely less intense than most of their powder highlighters I‚Äôve tried thus far). They‚Äôre on the lighter side, so they‚Äôll work best for fairer complexions or layered over stronger blushes to give them more a shift but not tons of shimmer, but I‚Äôd be curious to hear from those with medium and deeper complexions on how these red. The texture on these was odd; they felt like a drier (almost dried out!) cream-based product rather than as smooth and creamy as their powder highlighters but not at all like their Super Shock Highlighters. They went on better than I expected, and the overall performance was there, but the texture caught me off guard.",B+
COLOUR POP,AT TWILIGHT,Lipstick,"a medium coral with strong, warm orange undertones and a cream finish. It had opaque pigmentation in a single layer, though it had a moderate amount of slip, which made it harder to apply perfectly evenly as color slid around and looked a touch patchy in places. From a normal viewing distance, the very slight patchiness wasn‚Äôt noticeable. The texture was lightweight, creamy, and a little thicker, but it was comfortable to apply and to wear for the four and a half hours it lasted for. The formula felt lightly hydrating over time.",B+
COLOUR POP,DREAM DATE,Lipstick,"a light-medium peach with strong, warm undertones and a cream finish. The color applied oddly on me with the product looking almost like a yellowish-peach in areas and more like a pink-peach in other areas (like the center and edge of my lips). It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a more slippery consistency that felt creamy and comfortable to apply, but it slid around and pulled into my lip lines. It wore well for four hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.",B
COLOUR POP,HAPPY THOUGHTS,Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had rich color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips without dragging. The lipstick felt denser but still had just enough creaminess to apply without issue. It stayed on well for five hours and was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,107 BRONZE,Eyeshadow,"a medium, coppery base (with warmer undertones) paired with flecks of gold and pink sparkle that give it a peach-to-pink shifting finish. Most of the time, it read ‚Äúpeachy-copper with pink sheen‚Äù when I wore it on my cheeks with a slightly warmer and cooler appearance as I moved or tilted my face. As I mention in the ‚Äúformula overview,‚Äù this product worked best with some tackiness, whether patted over a cream eyeshadow, tacky base, liquid/cream foundation, or with an adhesive spray, which helped the micro-sparkles adhere better with less transfer/movement over time. The pigmentation was buildable and really depended on tool/application method and how much product one picked up (loose products are harder to be consistent with how ‚Äúmuch‚Äù is picked up compared to a pressed eyeshadow).",B
NARS,IGNITED,Palette,"a new, limited edition pink-themed palette with a mix of mattes, shimmers, and more sparkly/glittery shades. The matte shades are from the brand‚Äôs permanent range with the updated formula, while most of the shimmer/glitter eyeshadows are new/exclusive to the palette. The ‚Äúglitter shades can be applied dry or with a dampened brush for stronger intensity,‚Äù with the latter being pretty necessary to utilize the palette to the fullest and have the least trouble with fallout/application. If you want to use all of your eyeshadows dry and have it be a fuss-free experience, skip this one. For those who like their pops of sparkle and regularly use an adhesive spray or tacky base, you should have better luck with this palette.",B+
COLOUR POP,PRINCESA,Highlighter,"a pale, white-to-peach shifting loose highlighter with finer pearl and larger sparkles. It seemed to have a slightly whitish base but transformed to more of a pale, pinky-peach on my cheeks as I buffed it in. I didn‚Äôt see much of a shift in person, let alone in photos, but it was a moderate, glowing highlighter that didn‚Äôt emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. There was slight twinkling from the sparkle but didn‚Äôt read glittery as a finish once applied. It had sheerer coverage when applied with a fan brush and more medium, buildable coverage when applied with a denser brush (as marketed). It wore well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.",A-
COVER FX,SUNLIGHT,Highlighter,a medium-dark copper-shimmered bronze with warm undertones and pink and gold pearl. ,A
DIOR,PARISIAN SKY (506),Palette,"a new, limited edition five-pan palette for fall that features a medium brown, warm beige, pale silver, light blue, and brown-burgundy. It‚Äôs a so-so palette; workable if you really want to exert the effort, but it‚Äôs unlikely to merit paying the price. I think if you use a primer, it is marginally improved but some of the dustiness seemed to eat right through a solid base.",B-
NARS,SHIRLEY,Lipstick,"a deep red with subtle, warm undertones and a creamy, lightly glossy finish. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, creamy, and lightweight consistency that applied evenly and was comfortable to wear. This shade wore for over six hours and left behind a stain. The formula felt lightly hydrating on my lips.",A+
NARS,STEFANIA,Lipstick,"a deep, magenta fuchsia with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. The texture was smooth, creamy, and easy to apply as it didn‚Äôt tug on the lips and delivered rich, opaque coverage in a single stroke. The color lasted awhile‚Äìwell past six hours‚Äìand was neither drying nor hydrating over time.",A
CLE DE PEAU,ALMOND (16),Highlighter,a light beige with warm undertones and a light gold shimmer.,A
COVER FX,SUNSET,Highlighter,"medium-dark brown with warm, reddish undertones and a natural finish.",A
MAC,BLIND SCORE,Blush,"a ‚Äúdirty reddish lilac.‚Äù It‚Äôs a slightly muted, dark berry with cool undertones and a natural sheen.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,C503,Lipstick,"a bright pop of medium lavender with subtle, cool undertones and a creamy finish with a light sheen. The texture was lightweight, moderately creamy with noticeable slip, but applied fairly evenly overall‚Äìthough not as smoothly as other shades in the Cream range. This shade wore well nearly five hours but had some color settled into lip lines, though the formula was lightly hydrating",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,C506,Lipstick,"a deep berry with subtle, cool undertones and a lightly glossy finish. The texture was very smooth, creamy, and easy to apply as the color went on evenly and smoothly without tugging on the lips. It did feel wetter and more emollient than the majority of the Cream shades, though. I did not experience feathering or bleeding along the edges of my lips, but neither is something that I experience frequently so your mileage may vary. It lasted for over six hours, left behind a pink-hued stain, and was hydrating over time.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,C600,Lipstick,"a light white with cooler undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a lightweight, creamy consistency that applied unevenly and with noticeable streaks. I was surprised that while the brand nailed their black-hued lipstick, they really left a lot to be desired with this shade. Due to the texture and how it appears alone, it is likely better for mixing and layering than as a standalone shade, so it is not as versatile other shades in the range. The color lasted for four hours and was lightly hydrating, but I noticed some color pulled into lip lines after two and a half hours of wear.",C
MAC,GUTTER GAL,Eyeshadow,"an ‚Äúoff-white grey [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a very light taupe with warm undertones and a matte finish. The texture was very smooth, almost cream-like, and it yielded opaque color coverage. It was harder to apply evenly on the lid, as it tended to sheer out a bit once blended. The color lasted for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
MAC,BOWL OUT,Eyeshadow,"an ‚Äúmid-tone grey [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark taupe with a hint of warmth paired with a matte finish. It had good color coverage that went on evenly and blended out well. The texture was smooth without being too soft or too firm. I noticed fading of this shade after eight hours.",B+
MAC,300 GAME,Eyeshadow,"an ‚Äúblackened cherry [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a deep plum with neutral-to-warm undertones and a matte finish. It had rich color payoff, but it didn‚Äôt adhere as well to dry skin as one might hope. It works a bit better over a primer, with respect to pigmentation, but it didn‚Äôt blend out perfectly even over primer‚Äìthere was a slight patchiness around the edges so the color looked dragged out rather than diffused. The color wore well for eight hours.",C+
MAC,BOWLARAMA,Eyeshadow,"an ‚Äúbright lime green [with a Satin finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, chartreuse green with warm, yellow undertones and a satin finish. It had great color payoff paired with a soft, lightly dusty consistency that adhered fairly well to the skin without sheering out too much. The color lasted for eight hours on me before fading.",B+
MAC,IT'S A STRIKE,Lipgloss,a ‚Äúsoft nude pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium pinky-mauve with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage that went on fairly evenly and had minimal settling. The gloss lasted for three hours and was lightly hydrating while worn.,B-
MAC,KING PIN,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúdeep chocolate mauve.‚Äù It‚Äôs a deep brown with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage‚Äìrather pigmented for a Cremesheen Glass, which is a sheerer coverage formula‚Äìthat went on evenly but some color pulled into lip lines. The texture was smooth, creamy, and comfortable to wear over the four hours this shade lasted. The formula was hydrating while worn.",B-
MAC,SPARE ME,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúdark purple.‚Äù It‚Äôs a dark berry with cool undertones and a jelly-like finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation paired with a smooth, lightweight texture. The application, however, left a bit to be desired as it didn‚Äôt go on as evenly as one would wish, and I had some color darken my lip lines. This shade wore well for four hours and was moisturizing.",B
MAC,THROW A SPARE,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúfuchsia with pearl.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool, bluish undertones and iridescent purple and pink sparkle. It had semi-sheer color coverage that went on evenly and smoothly without settling into lip lines. The texture was fairly smooth, though I could feel a couple of the sparkles if I pressed my lips together. This shade lasted for three hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",B+
MAC,RIGHT UP MY ALLEY,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúdark red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a rich, medium-dark pink-red with cool undertones and a cream finish. This shade went on rather evenly with only a bit of color settling and darkening lip lines. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which is higher than expected with this formula, so it may or may not be what you‚Äôre looking for. This shade wore well for four hours and was hydrating over time.",B
MAC,BABES AND BALLS,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep burgundy [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a deep berry-plum with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had mostly opaque pigmentation that covered the lips with even color. The texture was lightly creamy, which made it glide on without tugging on the lips, but it didn‚Äôt slide around or feather on me while worn. This shade was still going strong after six hours, and it was neither drying nor hydrating over that period of time.",A
MAC,PERFECT SCORE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep red [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark red with subtle, cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. The pigmentation was fantastic and covered lips with opaque color in a single pass. It had a velvety consistency that applied easily and didn‚Äôt tug on the lips. This shade was still fully intact after six hours of wear, but it started to feel drying after the fifth hour.",A
MAC,BOWL ME OVER,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep burnt brown [with a Retro Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark burgundy with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good color coverage, though it was not fully opaque, that applied evenly. The consistency felt lightweight, velvety, and was thin overall. It‚Äôs more like modern Retro Mattes and less like past Retro Mattes that would drag, tug, and pull painfully. On me, the color lasted for a solid six and a half hours and could easily be worn longer. It was lightly drying after four hours of wear.",A-
MAC,LIQUID LUREX,Lipstick,"a ‚Äútarnished gold [with a Dazzle finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a dirty gold base with multi-colored glitter‚Äìprimarily pewter, gold, and pink. It had semi-sheer color coverage that was mostly the result of the high density of glitter in the sheerer, lightly glossy base color. The texture is noticeable on the lips, due to the amount of glitter, but I only saw less than a dozen glitter particles stray beyond my lips over the three and a half hours it lasted (though some glitter lingered for longer than that).",C
VISEART,BIJOUX ROYAL (09),Palette,"a set of 12 shimmery eyeshadows in muted jewel tones. The quality was consistent across all of the shades; they were pigmented, blendable, soft without being too powdery, and easy to work with. Some shades were closer to perfection than others, but there weren‚Äôt any misses or even so-so shades in the palette. If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with Viseart, their palettes were designed to work with each other, so for someone who likes a mix of mattes and shimmers, it is designed to be used with one of Viseart‚Äôs all-matte palettes. It‚Äôs a beautiful palette that is just dreamy to use as it blends out with little to no effort while still maintaining rich, true-to-pan color.",A
COVER FX,CELESTIAL,Highlighter,"a light, almost icy, pink with subtle, warmer undertones and a mix of cooler and warmer silver, pink, and gold pearl.",A
MAC,ITSY BITSY,Lipgloss,"an icy, pinky-lavender with cool undertones and multi-colored pearl along with larger, copper flecks of sparkle. It had semi-opaque color coverage with all of the shimmer in it; the base color seemed sheerer and tended to blend in with my natural lip color, but there was a ton of shimmer in this one that made the gloss appear more opaque applied. This shade wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",B+
MAC,DILLY DAZZLE,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark purple with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had medium coverage with a light-medium weight texture that was noticeably tacky and had a tendency to highlight lip lines. While a lot of the shades from the Little MAC collection weren‚Äôt streaky, this one was surprisingly difficult to even out on the lips. On me, the color wore for five hours. ",C+
MAC,LOVE YOU BIG TIME,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark magenta purple with subtle, warm undertones and cooler, lavender and pink shimmer. It had semi-opaque color coverage that could have applied more evenly. The color didn‚Äôt pool into lip lines like some of the Lipglasses do, so that was an upside. If you don‚Äôt mind the lack of opacity, it is a more unique shade that wears longer (five hours) and is comfortable to wear",B+
ANASTASIA,VAMP,Lipgloss,"a slightly muted, medium-dark reddish-burgundy with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. The coverage was semi-opaque, and a second layer might give you better coverage, but the consistency is most comfortable with just one layer in my experience. It felt lightweight, moderately hydrating, and sat well on the lips over the five hours it lasted.",A-
ANASTASIA,VENOM,Lipgloss,"a deep, reddish-burgundy with fuchsia and violet pearl. It had semi-opaque color coverage that applied evenly, but I did have issues with some of the color gathering and darkening my lip lines. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too noticeable from a normal viewing distance, and the lack of streaking did make it better than some alternatives I‚Äôve tried. The color lasted for six hours and was really hydrating over time.",A-
ANASTASIA,BORDEAUX,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark brick red with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, where a bit of the natural lip color peeked through. The texture was lightweight, mostly non-sticky, and comfortable to wear over the six hours the gloss lasted. The color applied evenly and smoothly with little effort.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,C601,Lipstick,"a bright, medium mint green with subtle, warm undertones and a satin sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that went on somewhat evenly, but it did pull into lip lines, and there were a few patchy places. For the type of color it is, the application was still better than usual, but this needs a primer or lip liner underneath to help it apply better. The texture was lightweight, creamy, and felt hydrating over the four and a half hours it lasted.",B
MAKE UP FOR EVER,C602,Lipstick,"a bright, cyan blue with cool undertones and a creamy, lightly glossy finish. It was moderately creamy, and I was surprised to find it still applied rather well, as this type of color paired with so much slip is usually a total disaster! That being said, there was a bit of color that sunk into lip lines, which worsened as the lipstick wore on. I would recommend lightly blotting the shine down with a tissue or the back of your hand, which helps to minimize settling over time. On me, this shade wore well for four and a half hours and was hydrating. It did leave a very subtle bluish stain behind.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,C603,Lipstick,"a deep, navy blue with subtle, cool undertones and a glossy finish. The texture was moderately creamy but had more slip‚Äìit felt wetter and looked that way applied‚Äìbut went on relatively evenly and with semi-opaque coverage. I think a lip liner underneath this one would help amplify the coverage while minimizing the slip. On me, this shade lasted for four and a half hours but moved around more than ideal, though I did not personally experience feathering/bleeding around the edges, it is something that might be more of a concern for someone who is prone to either.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,PUPPY LOVE,Blush,"a muted, medium mauve-y brown with warm undertones and a matte finish.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M402,Lipstick,"a bold, medium-dark red with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good color payoff that applied evenly and smoothly without emphasizing the texture of my lips too much. The color wore well for over six hours and left a stain behind, while the formula felt lightly drying after four and a half hours of wear.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M500,Lipstick,"a deep burgundy with subtle, cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had mostly opaque coverage with a lightly velvety consistency that glided on without tugging and distributed color evenly. The formula felt somewhat drying after four and a half hours, while the color lasted for nearly seven hours and left behind a strong, reddish stain.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,M501,Lipstick,"a dark berry with pinky undertones and a semi-matte finish. Oddly, the lipstick had an iridescent green sheen to it (in the same way some of Urban Decay‚Äôs matte Vice lipsticks had!) but doesn‚Äôt actually have shimmer. It‚Äôs hard to find true matte berry-hued lipsticks, from my experience, as there aren‚Äôt too many dupes for this one. It had a smooth, velvety texture that didn‚Äôt tug as it applied, and it laid down color evenly. The consistency wasn‚Äôt as flat-matte as it could have been, but I think that helped it be more forgiving when applied. This shade wore nicely for over six hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
URBAN DECAY,BUMP,Eyeliner,"a bright white with a satiny sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in one stroke, which applied fairly fluidly and didn‚Äôt skip. In order to get truly opaque coverage, a second layer is needed, but be sure to wait until the first layer dries down. It lasted for ten hours on me.",B
URBAN DECAY,CUFF,Eyeliner,"a bright silver with a metallic sheen. It had semi-sheer color coverage, even after I spent a good bit of time shaking up the tube; on the best application, I was able to get semi-opaque coverage, but three of the four times I tried swatching for better coverage, it was just semi-sheer. If you want to layer this for true opacity, just make sure to let the first layer dry.",C
URBAN DECAY,REVOLVER,Eyeliner,"a dark gray with silver and teal shimmer. It had semi-sheer color payoff in one pass (and I did shake it up for about 20 seconds), and it didn‚Äôt improve even after opening/closing the product over the course of a week to see if it would dry out any. The texture was thinner, somewhat runny and watery, and it was harder to control. Once on, the liner locked on for ten hours without issue.",D+
URBAN DECAY,PERVERSION,Eyeliner,"a deep, dark black with a satin sheen. It was intensely pigmented with a fluid, smooth consistency that wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin, though it is thinner than the average eyeliner from my experience. It lasted for ten hours on me.",A
URBAN DECAY,GOLDRUSH,Eyeliner,"a medium, yellowy gold with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. After swatching this five times, it seemed to thicken and become more pigmented, but the first four times, it was always semi-sheer, so it may be like some mascaras where after some use, it dries out and actually is better.",C+
URBAN DECAY,SNAKEBITE,Eyeliner,"a medium-dark brown with gold and bronze pearl. It had semi-opaque coverage initially, which you could layer if you made sure to let the initial layer dry down and get opaque coverage. The liquid eyeliner did apply smoothly and evenly, though, and it still went for a full 10 hours without budging on me.",B-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,C103,Lipstick,"a very light, pink-tinged beige with a creamy, lightly shiny finish. It had nearly opaque color payoff, but the real feat here was how evenly it applied, despite being a very light shade. The consistency was creamy, comfortable, and felt hydrating over the four hours it lasted. I did have a little bit of the color gather in my lip lines over time.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,C104,Lipstick,"a muted, medium rosy peach with warm undertones and a creamy, lightly shiny finish. It had great pigmentation that applied with smooth, even coverage and sat well on the lips. The consistency was creamy enough to glide on and fill in lip lines to give the illusion of healthier lips while not being too emollient and sliding around. It wore well for four and a half hours and was nicely hydrating.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,C105,Lipstick,"a soft, light-medium rosy pink with warmer undertones and a satin finish. The color coverage was opaque, while the texture was smooth, lightly creamy, and comfortable to wear. It applied evenly and didn‚Äôt cling to the lips. This shade wore well for just over four hours on me and was lightly hydrating over time.",A
NARS,MELINA,Palette,"one of two new, permanent highlighting/contour duos for fall. The highlighting shade in the duos tends to be mostly matte, so it is not your typical shimmery, glowy highlighter. This is one of the deeper duos, so it should be good for someone who wants a more dramatic contour or for someone with a medium or darker skin tone.",B+
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,SECRET SALMA,Lipstick,"a muted, medium rosy mauve with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque coverage that went on evenly and smoothly. The texture was thinner and clung, but it didn‚Äôt emphasize texture like some of the other shades have. It wore well for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,HOT EMILY,Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange-coral with warm undertones and a creamy, lightly glossy finish. It had very nearly opaque pigmentation with a smooth, creamy, and comfortable consistency that sat well on the lips. It applied evenly and lasted for four hours on me, while the formula was lightly hydrating.",A-
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,MIRANDA MAY,Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink-coral with warm undertones and a matte finish. The texture is thin but smoth, and it does feel a little clingy, though it was neither drying nor hydrating on me. The coverage was mostly opaque, not quite what I‚Äôd say is buildable (it‚Äôs pretty pigmented right out of the gate; hard to sheer it out without becoming very uneven). The color lasted for three and a half hours on me.",B+
CLINIQUE,BRONZE GLOW,Highlighter,a medium-dark brown with warm undertones and a satin sheen.,B
MAKEUP GEEK,INFATUATION,Blush,"a medium brown with warm, orange undertones and a mostly matte finish.",A
MAKEUP REVOLUTION,GOLDEN LIGHTS,Highlighter,"a white gold with strong, yellow-gold shimmer.",B
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,KIM K.W.,Lipstick,"a light-medium, pinky beige with warm undertones and a creamy, natural sheen. This shade is part of the original Kissing formula, so it is much creamier, a little weightier, and has more slip than the Matte Revolution range. It was also hydrating and more comfortable to wear over time, though this particular shade ended up applying somewhat streaky due to the amount of slip and the lighter color. It had semi-opaque coverage that did well into my lip lines over time. On me, it lasted for three and a half hours.",B-
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,KIDMAN'S KISS,Lipstick,"a medium, pinky-coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. It is part of the Matte Revolution formula. It had medium, buildable pigmentation, which is in line with the formula, that goes on without tugging on the lips but tended to emphasize every imperfection on my lips. The color also pulled into lip lines noticeably after two hours of wear, while the lipstick lasted closer to four hours overall. I found it neither drying nor hydrating.",B
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,SUPER CINDY,Lipstick,"a muted, medium rosy coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had medium, buildable coverage that applied easily without dragging or skipping on the lips. The texture had some slip, and as a result, it wasn‚Äôt as matte as some shades in the Matte Revolution range, but it was more comfortable to wear and lightly hydrating after the three hours it lasted.",B+
MAC,BRIGHT RESPONSE,Blush,"a ‚Äúvibrant clean orange [with a Frost finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, tangerine orange with warm, yellow undertones paired with a frosted, golden shimmer.",A
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,HEL'S BELLS,Lipstick,"a deep berry with cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage that went on evenly and smoothly. It had light slip, so it didn‚Äôt cling or feel uncomfortable on, but it thinner than most lipsticks. This shade is a Matte Revolution formula, though it wasn‚Äôt truly matte to me. The color lasted for five hours, left a stain behind, and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,TELL LAURA,Lipstick,"a medium-dark orange-red with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had rich color payoff (not what I‚Äôd call buildable‚Äìyou‚Äôd have to use just a pat and blend with fingertips for sheerer coverage!) that went on smoothly and evenly. This shade is in the Matte Revolution formula, and it had a more matte finish and felt a smidgen clingy, but this shade was denser and a little heavier than most of the Matte Revolution range. This shade wore well for four and a half hours and was neither just slightly hydrating.",A-
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,CARINA'S LOVE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark red with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had medium, buildable coverage‚Äìin line with the Matte Revolution formula‚Äìthat applied evenly and felt a little clingy due to the thinner consistency. The color lasted five hours and left a stain behind, but I found it a little drying after three hours.",A-
BH COSMETICS,FOIL EYES,Palette,"28, metallic eyeshadows. I picked this up a couple of months ago, because it was getting a lot of buzz, and I‚Äôve been really impressed by the quality overall. Only a few shades had issues, and they were fairly minor (slightly less pigmented, could apply better with primer or with a dampened brush). The majority of the eyeshadows were very pigmented, applied beautifully on bare skin, blended out easily, and lasted for seven to nine hours on me (without primer). As they are all shimmery, it may not work as well as an all-in-one-look palette, though. If you like your high-shimmer, metallic eyeshadows, it‚Äôs well worth checking out!",A
MAC,GLOW RIDA,Highlighter,"a ‚Äúbeige.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium peach with warm, orange undertones and a fine pearl, plus larger sparkle.",B+
MAC,CAN'T BE TAMED,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúsheer lime yellow [with a Cremesheen finish].‚Äù It is a semi-sheer, chartreuse with a natural sheen. It was somewhat uneven and a little streaky, while some color gathered into lip lines over time, though I‚Äôll say it applied a lot better than I expected. This would work better over a lip liner or patted over another lipstick to layer and alter the color. The color lasted for two and a half hours on me.",C+
MAC,"DANCE OFF, PANTS OFF",Lipstick,"a ‚Äúfrosted hot pink [with a Frosted finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, fuchsia pink with cool undertones and multi-colored shimmer. It had semi-opaque color coverage that went on evenly and smoothly without dragging. The lipstick‚Äôs consistency was thin but not clingy. The color lasted well for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
MAC,MIDNIGHT TROLL,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúrich blue [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium-dark navy blue with strong, cool undertones (almost looks violet in some lighting conditions) with a satin finish. It isn‚Äôt matte to me, and it had enough slip in it that it doesn‚Äôt apply as evenly as a true matte might have in this hue. The color lasted for five hours and left a strong stain behind. The formula was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
MAC,CHARTREUSE,Eyeshadow,"a bright, light-medium chartreuse with strong, warm undertones. It‚Äôs been around for ages, but it is being repromoted in this launch and will be specially packaged for the Good Luck Trolls collection. I‚Äôve always loved this shade as a base color underneath brighter blues, greens, and teals. The nice thing about MAC Pigments is that they bind well on their own, so you can use them just damp and get really smooth, even application, or you can use their Mixing Medium for additional hold, but you can also apply them dry and get them to adhere and wear well on the lid. Chartreuse was richly pigmented, applied well, blended easily, and wore for eight hours before creasing on me.",A
MAC,"SUN'S OUT, BUNS OUT",Eyeshadow,"a brighter, light-medium golden yellow with warm undertones and a frosted finish. It had good color payoff with a fairly soft, smooth consistency that applied well to the lid. I found I preferred a flatter brush with this for really smoothing out the color on m lid. This shade wore well for eight hours before creasing.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,ATLANTIC BLUE,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, cobalt blue with a matte finish. It has decent, fairly buildable pigmentation, but it can be hard to blend out as it is a little drier and thinner. It is somewhat more manageable over a primer, but I have the best luck using it primer and then layering it on top of another eyeshadow for added depth. The color wore well for eight hours on me.",C+
MAKEUP GEEK,CHIVALRY,Blush,"a dark, reddish brown with warm undertones and a satin finish.",B+
MAC,NORDSTROM C'EST CHIC,Palette,"a set of 15 matte, neutral-hued eyeshadows in a large, plastic compact. Each eyeshadow is full-sized, but they‚Äôre not easily removed (they are glued in). I can see this palette being really useful for someone who likes MAC‚Äôs matte eyeshadow formula and needs neutrals in their stash. Overall, it‚Äôs a good palette, and like most MAC eyeshadows, they tend to perform better when I used them on my eyes than just on my arm. I didn‚Äôt have any major issues with any shades; the texture is firmer but soft, blendable, and the pigmentation varied from semi-opaque to opaque (most shades were buildable). The wear was eight to nine hours, without primer. There are three permanent shades in this palette: Soft Brown, Corduroy, and Embark.",B+
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,NIGHT FEVER & HOT STUFF (508),Blush,"a medium-dark pink with subtle, warm undertones and a luminous sheen. The lighter shade is a light-medium pink with very subtle blue undertones, while the deeper shade was a rosy plum; each shade seemed similarly shimmery.",A
MAC,NEVER SAY NEVER,Blush,"a ‚Äúdeep scarlet red [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark pink-red with subtle, cool undertones and a mostly matte finish.",A-
ANASTASIA,SEPIA,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark reddish-brown with warm undertones and a cream finish. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, creamy consistency that spread well across the lips and didn‚Äôt appear streaky. The color wore well for four and a half hours on me and was hydrating over time.",A
ANASTASIA,VINTAGE,Lipgloss,"a dusty, medium pink-mauve with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that covered fairly evenly. I noticed a little bit of color settling into lip lines, but it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance (only up-close). This shade lasted for four and a half hours on me and felt moisturizing.",A-
ANASTASIA,DUSTY LILAC,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark pink-lavender with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage with a lightweight, smooth, and comfortable consistency that highlighted lip lines slightly. This shade wore well for four and a half hours on me and was hydrating.",A-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,FLESH & FANTASY (506),Blush,"muted, medium peach with hints of brown and warmer undertones paired with a soft sheen. The lighter shade is more of a light, golden beige with a shimmery sheen, while the deeper shade is a muted, dark peach-brown with a satin finish.",A-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,KINK & KISSES (504),Blush,"soft, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a luminous finish. It is comprised of a shimmery, very light, rose pink and a medium-dark pink-coral with a more satiny sheen.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,VELVET BLOOM,Blush,"a light-medium pink with cool, blue undertones and satin finish paired with a dusting of pale pink sparkle.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,BLIND DATE,Blush,"a light-medium, peachy-pink with warm undertones and a matte finish.",A-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,LUSH & LIBIDO (500),Blush,"a bright, medium peony pink with subtle, cool undertones and a satiny sheen. The lighter color is warmer and a little more shimmery, appearing as a soft petal pink, while the deeper shade is more of a slightly muted fuchsia pink with blue undertones and a true satin finish.",A-
NARS,SUMMER 2016,Palette,"four, limited edition powder blushes (one is more of a highlighter shade for most skin tones). The three blushes shades are richer shades, and two of the shades are quite deep, so I can see this working on a variety of skin tones. When working with the formula dry, I find it easy to apply and blend out, and they perform well overall. Damp application is harder to work with on my skin, as it doesn‚Äôt blend out as easily; it is better patted on with a damp fingertip or on bare skin (something about the damp brush/powder seems to disturb any base products more often than not for me). The wear ranged from seven to nine hours for me with damp application lasting longer overall.",A-
GUERLAIN,NEON PUMPS (065),Lipstick,"a medium, fuchsia pink with blue undertones and a soft sheen. It had semi-sheer color coverage after two layers, so it seemed slightly sheerer than most of the shades I‚Äôve tried in the range. It had a thin texture with barely-there sheen, and it was neither drying nor hydrating over the three and a half hours it lasted.",B
GUERLAIN,BERRY BERET (066),Lipstick,"a medium, fuchsia pink with subtle, blue undertones and a soft, pearly sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered evenly and smoothly after two layers. This shade wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating. The texture was lightly emollient, more like a lip balm, and thin without being clingy.",A
GUERLAIN,CHERRY CAPE (067),Lipstick,"a medium, fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque coverage after two layers, which is as described. The texture was smooth, balm-like, and glided on easily, though this particular shade seemed to have less shine than some of the other shades. The formula was lightly hydrating over the four and a half hours it lasted. The range has a few more fuchsia/raspberry pink shades, and on me, they seemed to run together and were harder to differentiate between.",A
LANCOME,GLOWING LIGHTS,Highlighter,"a medium, rosy copper with warm undertones and a frosted sheen.",A+
MAC,ANYTHING BUT DEMURE,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium mauve-pink with warm undertones and a smattering of fine, gold pearl. It had good pigmentation that went on evenly, though I noticed some of the gloss welled up in lip lines. It wasn‚Äôt too noticeable from a normal viewing distance, though. The gloss was comfortable to wear and wore well for four and a half hours. The formula was hydrating for me.",A-
MAC,FAB TESTED,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark plummy brown with warm undertones and a cream finish. It applied really well with smooth, even coverage that didn‚Äôt settle into lip lines. The color payoff was mostly opaque, and I think it would be totally opaque with an additional half layer of gloss. This shade wore well for five hours and was lightly moisturizing over time.",A
MAC,ABSOLUTE SCORE,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark taupe-brown with neutral undertones and a cream finish. It had mostly opaque pigmentation that went on fairly evenly and smoothly. The texture was lightweight, comfortable, and didn‚Äôt sink into lip lines. On me, the gloss lasted for five hours and was lightly hydrating.",A-
MAC,SMART ALECK,Lipgloss,"a bold, bright, medium-dark pinky-red with cool, blue undertones and a jelly-like finish. It had good pigmentation‚Äìnot quite opaque‚Äìwith a translucent quality to it that reminded me of a stain or jelly. The consistency was lightweight, smooth, and easy to wear over a six hour period, as the formula was moderately moisturizing.",A
TOO FACED,TOTALLY CUTE,Palette,"a new, limited edition nine-pan eyeshadow palette with several neutral shades and a few pops of color. One of the selling points is that the palette has a soft pink exterior that was designed for you to decorate with stickers, which are included. (If you purchased directly from Too Faced, you‚Äôll get an additional sticker sheet.) I wish I could say it was a decent palette, but I actually found it surprisingly difficult to apply, even when I used it with Too Faced‚Äôs Shadow Insurance Primer. The difference in application with primer was minor, while the longevity was the most improved by primer. The mattes were thinner, and they didn‚Äôt blend as well with the denser, metallic shades. The standout shades were Clover and Storm Cloud, but shades like Shooting Star, I Love TF, and Meow! were more time-consuming to use.",B-
URBAN DECAY,TANTRIC,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúlight nude-pink [with a Sheer finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, pinky-peach with a luminous sheen. It had semi-opaque color coverage, but it applied unevenly and settled into lip lines from the get-go. The consistency was lightly creamy and balm-like, but I just couldn‚Äôt keep the color in place. This shade lasted for two and a half hours on me and was lightly hydrating. ",C+
URBAN DECAY,LOVELIGHT,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúpale peach with pink shimmer [with a Sheer Shimmer finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium pinky-coral with warm undertones and fine, gold shimmer. It had semi-sheer color coverage with a thin, balm-like consistency that ‚Äúmelted‚Äù as it warmed up against the lips, but initially, it had a firmer feel against the lips. I felt like the thinner texture emphasized my lip lines, though. The color wore werll for three hours and was lightly hydrating overall.",B+
URBAN DECAY,EX-GIRLFRIEND,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúnude-rose with pink shimmer [with a Sheer finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, peachy-brown with warm undertones and a fine gold shimmer-sheen finish. It had sheer color coverage, which just seemed to darken and warm-up my natural lip color‚ÄìI expect this will vary a lot from person to person due to the sheerness of it. The color lasted for three hours on me, but it was lightly moisturizing. It seemed to have slightly more pigmentation than the one in the Gwen Stefani release.",B+
URBAN DECAY,HITCH HIKE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbrick rose [with a Comfort Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark rosy plum with warm undertones and a creamy finish. It had rich color payoff with a very smooth, creamy consistency that glides onto lips and just makes lips look plumper. This shade wore well for five and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",A
URBAN DECAY,AMULET,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúmetallic brick rose [with a Metallized finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark plummy brown with warm undertones and a metallic shimmer-sheen finish. It had nearly opaque coverage‚Äìwhich isn‚Äôt as common with the Metallized finish‚Äìthat went on evenly. The consistency was lightly creamy, not too slippery, and sat well on the lips. This shade wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating.",A
MAC,MANGROVE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúhot, bright red [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, bright, medium orange-red with strong, orange undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good pigmentation that covered evenly and smoothly. The consistency was thinner but not so thin that it dragged nor did it apply sheerly. On me, it lasted for six hours and left a stain behind, though it was also a bit drying. This is a repromote.",A
MAC,NIFTY NEON,Lipstick,"an ‚Äúorange [with an Amplified finish].‚Äù I‚Äôt s a light-medium, yellowed orange with warm undertones and a creamy, lightly shiny finish. The pigmentation was fully opaque, and it covered evenly. The texture was moderately emollient, comfortable to apply and to wear, and went on smoothly. The color wore well for four hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",A-
MAC,GOLD XIXI,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúlemony pastel yellow [with a Lustre finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium yellow with strong, warm undertones and a lustrous sheen. It had semi-sheer coverage on its own‚Äìnot unexpected, given the Lustre finish‚Äìthat goes on unevenly and pulls into lip lines. The color lasted for two and a half hours on its own. Like Frosting, it would be more practical to use to mix and layer with other shades, though it will add some slip to whatever you layer it with, so I liked it best patted on the center of lips or over a more matte lipstick. This is a repromote.",C
LORAC,PRISM,Blush,"a muted, medium peach with a hint of pink paired with a matte finish.",B+
TARTE,GRUNGE,Lipstick,"a deep, muted red-brown with subtle, warm undertones and a natural finish. It had opaque color payoff with a thinner consistency that wasn‚Äôt too watery or too dense, so it spread easily across the lips but applied evenly. On me, this shade wore well for six hours but was drying over time.",A
TARTE,RAVE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark plummy-taupe with neutral undertones and a soft sheen. It had rich pigmentation that covered the lips evenly and smoothly. The texture was thin and somewhat slippery, so it moved around more than other shades and only lasted for four hours, despite being a darker shade. It was somewhat drying over time.",B+
TARTE,NAUGHTY,Lipstick,"a deep, inky black with subtle, cool undertones and a natural sheen. It had good pigmentation with a slightly thin texture that spread across the lips easily, but it was a little streaky in places and tended to pool into lip lines. The deeper shade made it harder to notice that, though.",B+
OCC,STRANGE & UNUSUAL,Lipstick,"a muted, rosy plum with subtle, warmer undertones and a fine, metallic shimmer. It had mostly opaque color payoff with a smooth, lightweight consistency that spread across the lips evenly. I‚Äôve found that a lot of the Metallic shades have more slip and aren‚Äôt always as pigmented as the Cream Lip Tars, but this one was just right and went on nicely. It lasted for five and a half hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
OCC,WORKING GIRL,Lipstick,"a bright, almost neon pink with subtle, cool undertones and warmer gold shimmer. It had good pigmentation, though not fully opaque, with a moderately emollient consistency that spread well across the lips but had a tendency to highlight lip lines. The brighter color made it less noticeable from a normal viewing distance at least! This shade wore well for five hours, left behind a stain, and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
TARTE,BROWNIE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark brown with warm, yellow undertones and a natural sheen. It had opaque color coverage with a thin, spreadable consistency that wasn‚Äôt too watery or too mousse-like. The texture sat well on the lips initially, but over time, it does seem to emphasize lip lines. This shade lasted for five hours on me and was lightly drying. Keep in mind, this is not a typical liquid lipstick that dries down to an ultra-matte, transfer-proof finish‚Äìit does transfer, but it is pigmented enough that it doesn‚Äôt seem to lose intensity after drinking or light meals (no fried chicken!).",A-
TARTE,CHOKER,Lipstick,"a muted, medium brown with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It was intensely pigmented with a lightweight texture that applied evenly and smoothly with little effort. The color wore well for five hours, settled into lip lines just slightly, and was somewhat drying.",A-
TARTE,CROP TOP,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark plummy-brown with warmer undertones and a lightly glossy finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, but there was a grittiness to the consistency, almost as if it wasn‚Äôt fully mixed, that was unusual. The texture was more slippery than a lot of the other Lip Paints I‚Äôve tried as well. It lasted for four hours and settled noticeably into lip lines, while the formula was drying overall.",C+
URBAN DECAY,F-BOMB,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúclassic red [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium-dark red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a creamy, lightly glossy finish. It was nicely pigmented with full color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly. The consistency was dense enough that it helped to fill in lines and make lips appear plumper and smoother. This shade wore well for six hours and was lightly hydrating.",A
URBAN DECAY,TEMPER,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúred-orange [with a Comfort Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a slightly muted, medium-dark orange-red with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had good pigmentation that covered evenly and smoothly. The consistency was very creamy, and it glided on without tugging on the lips while laying down full coverage in one stroke. This shade wore well for five hours on me and was very lightly hydrating.",A
URBAN DECAY,ZEALOT,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúsatin red with micro-shimmer [with a Metallized finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium red with warm undertones and very fine pink and ruby red shimmer. The shimmer is fine enough that it adds a subtle sheen to the lipstick, but it isn‚Äôt noticeable by feel or look overtly shimmery. The texture was smooth and applied evenly, and it really did feel like a shimmery take on their Cream finish. This shade stayed on for five and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",A
URBAN DECAY,BAD BLOOD,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep red [with a Comfort Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark red with warm, brown undertones and a satiny sheen. It had very nearly opaque pigmentation that applied easily as the texture was very creamy and smooth without feeling heavy on. This shade lasted for five hours, left a stain behind, and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
URBAN DECAY,714,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright red [with a Mega Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium red with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a very lightly creamy consistency; just creamy enough that it didn‚Äôt drag or feel uncomfortable when applying. For me, while the color was very similar to the 714 released previously, the texture was much, much better. The color was still going strong after six hours of wear, but it was moderately drying.",A
LAURA GELLER,ROSEBERRY,Blush,"medium, muted, rosy plum with warm undertones and a satin finish.",B+
MAKEUP ATELIER,NUDE (T01S),Palette,"five eyeshadows. The color combination seemed more unique than not, as it combined warmer and cooler tones together, which resulted in an combination I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever worn before. The formula ran thin, sometimes a little dusty, but they were blendable and fairly easy to apply to bare skin. They tended to fade or crease within seven hours of wear for me. I‚Äôm not sold on the formula yet, but I have six more palettes to try!",B
URBAN DECAY,NATIVE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúpale pink [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium pink with subtle, neutral-to-cool undertones and a creamy, lightly glossy finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly for the most part, but it had a lot of slip and really seemed prone to getting into the lines of my lips. The formula was comfortable to wear and to apply, while wearing for four hours.",B
URBAN DECAY,HEARTLESS,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbaby pink [with a Comfort Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium pink with soft, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a creamy, smooth texture that was very easy to wear and apply, but it didn‚Äôt have the most flattering appearance on as it didn‚Äôt smooth out the texture of the lips‚Äìperhaps a little too much slip compared to other Comfort Mattes that appear better applied. It wore well for five hours and had some color settle into lip lines after three hours of wear. The formula felt neither drying nor hydrating to me.",A-
URBAN DECAY,BRAT,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúwarm baby pink [with a Sheer finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark pink with cool, blue undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-sheer pigmentation that applied evenly but highlighted the depth of lip lines. This shade lasted for three hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B-
URBAN DECAY,NAKED,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúnude-pink [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium rosy-pink with subtle, warm undertones and a glossy sheen. The Vice version is rosier and cooler than the Revolution version. It had semi-opaque pigmentation paired with a creamy, moderately emollient consistency that applied evenly but had some color pool into lip lines. If I pressed my lips together, I could see ‚Äúlines‚Äù develop. The formula was comfortable to wear and nicely hydrating, and it lasted for four hours on me.",B+
URBAN DECAY,MORNING AFTER,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúpale baby pink with blue undertone [with a Sheer finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a natural sheen. It has a warmer base in the tube and swatched, but applied, it looks almost cool in tone for me. As it had semi-sheer coverage, this is another shade that can look different from person to person as a result. It had a lightweight feel, moderate slip, and glided on without tugging. Some of the milkier color made its way to lip lines, but it wasn‚Äôt too noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The color lasted for three hours on me.",B+
URBAN DECAY,BOBBY DAZZLE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúwhite iridescent pearl [with a Metallized finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a neutral-to-warm leaning white shimmer. There‚Äôs not much color to it, and I imagine it would be better as a layering shade than on its own, though the lack of base color makes it wearable on its own. The consistency had some slip, was on the thinner side, and wasn‚Äôt drying when worn, though I had some of the milkiness seem to settle into lip lines. The shimmer wasn‚Äôt too noticeable on the lips and didn‚Äôt seem to migrate. It lasted for two hours on me. I think this shade would be better labeled as a Sheer Shimmer.",C-
URBAN DECAY,WALK OF SHAME,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúpale nude-pink [with a Sheer Shimmer finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, peachy-beige with warm undertones and very fine shimmer. It had semi-sheer color coverage, which means a lot of the natural lip color will come through, so this can look wildly different from person to person. On me, it lightens my natural lip color and washes it out. It applies somewhat unevenly and gathers in some of my lip lines. This shade lasted for two hours and was neither hydrating nor drying.",C
URBAN DECAY,BARFLY,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúpale nude [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium peach with warm, orange undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a creamy, light-medium-weight consistency that glided on without tugging, but this shade didn‚Äôt apply as evenly as other shades. I noticed that it struggled to adhere near the center of the lips for some reason. This lipstick wore well for four hours with some color pulling into lip lines over time.",B
URBAN DECAY,EARTHLING,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúpale nude with pink undertone [with a Sheer finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, peachy-beige with warm undertones and a natural finish. It is a lot like Walk of Shame, but this shade has more coverage (semi-opaque). It goes on somewhat evenly but is unforgiving. it seemed to catch on any imperfection on my lips. Some of the color pulled into lip lines, which worsened over the two and a half hours it lasted.",B-
URBAN DECAY,TRICK,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúmetallic pinky-copper shimmer with micro-sparkle [with a Metallized finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium gold with copper and fuchsia shimmer. It had semi-sheer color coverage that went on fairly evenly and didn‚Äôt emphasize lip lines. The shimmer is just barely noticeable when applying from the tube, but I don‚Äôt feel it when it is sitting on the lips. The consistency had moderate slip but wore for three hours. It did, however, feel more like a Sheer Shimmer.",C+
URBAN DECAY,WRATH,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúmetallic red [with a Metallized finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark red with subtle, warm undertones and a fine, ruby red shimmer. I find it very, very similar to Cruel, just with more pigmentation and finer, tonal shimmer. The shimmer is smoother in this one, so it has a more pearlescent sheen overall. It had nearly opaque color payoff with a creamy, lightly emollient texture that glided on easily and delivered even coverage. This shade wore well for almost six hours and was hydrating while worn.",A
URBAN DECAY,69,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright red with pink undertone [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium pink-red with blue undertones and a glossy, creamy finish. It had a really smooth, lightweight, and creamy consistency that had enough density to it that it made lips look smoother and plumper (also due in part to the higher-shine finish). The coverage was opaque, while the lipstick wore for over six hours and was hydrating.",A+
URBAN DECAY,DOUBT,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúred with blue undertone [with a Comfort Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a slightly muted, medium-dark red with cool, blue undertones and a mostly matte finish. It was one of the more matte finished shades in the Comfort Matte range (which tend to look more like satins). It was richly pigmented with one-stroke coverage that applied evenly and smoothly without gathering into lip lines. This shade wore well for over six hours and was lightly hydrating.",A
URBAN DECAY,SPIDERWEB,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúsatin red [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, bright, medium-dark red with cooler undertones and a natural sheen. It had nearly opaque color payoff, but there‚Äôs a very slight translucency that gives the lipstick a more gel-like finish overall. On me, it was still going strong after six hours of wear, and it was moderately hydrating over time. I didn‚Äôt experience feathering personally, but it did have some slip, so it might be an issue for others!",A
URBAN DECAY,CRUEL,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúred with copper shimmer [with a Metallic finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark red with warmer undertones and a multi-colored shimmer‚Äìgold, fuchsia, and copper. It had semi-opaque color payoff, and it felt more Cream like than Sheer, which is a plus (it‚Äôs supposed to be more like a Cream, just with a lot of shimmer!). The texture wasn‚Äôt too slippery, so it stayed in place well and applied evenly. This shade lasted for five and a half hours on me and was comfortable to wear.",A-
CITY COLOR,G*PSY,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, warm-toned purple with reddish tones and a pearly sheen. It had great color payoff with a soft, smooth, and blendable texture that wasn‚Äôt quite as dense as other shades‚Äìsomewhere between the cream-like feel of formulas like the Shimmer Shadow and traditional powder eyeshadow. This shade wore well for eight and a half hours on me.",A-
CITY COLOR,CLEO,Eyeshadow,"a rich, medium-dark copper with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It was very, very pigmented with a creamy, dense texture that blends out well and adheres to the skin intensely without primer. The only issue I had with this shade is really that it‚Äôs so dense and pigmented that it can look thicker in places until blended and smoothed out‚Äìso use less than you think you need. It wore well for eight hours before creasing.",A
CITY COLOR,U JELLY?,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark pink-plum with warm undertones and a frosted sheen. It had good color payoffs with a soft, blendable texture that wasn‚Äôt as dense as other shades, and it was also a smidgen powdery in the pan. It still seemed to apply easily and blend out without issue, though. It showed slight creasing after eight hours of wear.",A-
CITY COLOR,YAS!,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, copper-brown with warm, red undertones and a frosted sheen. The texture was a good balance between creamy, blendable, and dense‚Äìit applied well without losing its intensity, but it was very easy to apply and difficult to overdo. I noticed faint creasing after nine hours of wear.",A+
URBAN DECAY,MENACE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúmedium fuchsia-pink [with a Comfort Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark fuchsia with cool, bluish undertones and a mostly satin finish. This one seemed to have very, very faint shimmer in it. The texture was creamy, lightweight, and easy to apply, though it was thinner than some of the other Comfort Mattes and I could see streaks of color in the close-up photo (not apparent to my eye in real life). This shade lasted for five and a half hours and left behind a strong stain. The formula was neither hydrating nor drying.",A
URBAN DECAY,WONDERLAND,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdark pink-red [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a deep, medium-dark red-coral with warm undertones and a creamy, lightly shiny finish. It was richly pigmented with a light-to-medium-weight texture that was creamy and glided on well, but it had some density to it so that it adhered well to the lips (without feeling clingy). It was comfortable to wear, lightly hydrating, and lasted for five hours.",A
URBAN DECAY,STREAK,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúcoral-pink [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a creamy finish. This was one of the few shades that was noticeably different in color/tone from the prior formula to the new formula‚Äìthe Vice version is significantly cooler and pinker. The texture had moderate slip, some creaminess, and applied fairly evenly. It had semi-opaque coverage and felt more like a hybrid between the Sheer and Cream finishes than a true Cream. This shade lasted for four hours and was lightly hydrating.",B+
URBAN DECAY,CHECKMATE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúpink-fuchsia [with a Comfort Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, bright medium pink with warm undertones and a satin finish. It was richly pigmented and yielded full, even coverage that was smooth and didn‚Äôt pull into lip lines over time. The color lasted for five and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
URBAN DECAY,SNITCH,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúpale coral-pink [with a Sheer finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, peach-coral with warm undertones and a lustrous shine. It had semi-opaque coverage that applied decently, but it was somewhat streaky and highlighted lip lines. The texture was thin enough that it didn‚Äôt seem to truly settle into lip lines, but it was one of the less flattering shades applied in the line-up. It lasted for three hours and was lightly hydrating.",C+
URBAN DECAY,LADYFLOWER,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúrose-pink [with a Sheer Shimmer finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark pinky-plum with cool undertones and a natural sheen. It‚Äôs a smidgen more pigmented than the Sheer version of this from the Revolution range, but it is not as pigmented as the opaque as the regular Revolution shade. It had semi-sheer color payoff with a soft shine. The consistency felt slightly stiff initially but quickly warmed up against the lips and glided on more easily; I felt like this shade self-leveled after a minute or so after being applied. It wore for three and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",B+
URBAN DECAY,JILTED,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep fuchsia shimmer with blue shift [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium-dark fuchsia-berry with subtle, cool undertones and fuchsia shimmer. It had nearly opaque pigmentation‚Äìthere was just a hint of my lip freckle peeking through‚Äìwith a creamy, medium-weight texture that had moderate slip but didn‚Äôt feather or slide around too easily. The formula wore well for five hours, left a stain behind, and was hydrating.",A
URBAN DECAY,FIREBIRD,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep fuchsia [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark pinky-berry with cool, blue undertones and fuchsia pearl. It had mostly opaque pigmentation with a creamy, moderately emollient consistency that had a natural sheen to it. It was comfortable to wear, lightly hydrating, and wore for six hours.",A
URBAN DECAY,AFTERDARK,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúmedium-dark berry pink [with a Comfort Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a deep, plum-berry with cool undertones and a fine, subtle pearl. It had more of a semi-matte to satin finish‚Äìnot quite as satiny as others in the Comfort Matte finish but not truly matte. The consistency was lightweight, smooth, and creamy enough to glide on without tugging. It wore well for six hours, left behind a stain, and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
URBAN DECAY,VENOM,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright plum [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a deep, muted berry with cool undertones and fine purple and pink shimmer. It had mostly opaque color coverage with a creamy, lightly glossy consistency that glided on well and wore for five hours. It left behind a stain, and it didn‚Äôt feather on me over time. It swatched very similarly (I couldn‚Äôt detect a difference) on the skin, but it appears more muted/deeper in pigment applied, which translated into a darker, less pink end result for me.",A
URBAN DECAY,LIQUID,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbrown-plum [with a Sheer finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark plummy brown with warm, red undertones and a soft sheen. It had semi-sheer color payoff that went on fairly evenly. The texture was lightweight, thin with some slip and felt balm-like when initially applied. On me, it lasted for three and a half hours and was very lightly moisturizing.",B+
URBAN DECAY,PERVERSION,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúblack [with a Comfort Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a deep black with neutral undertones and a very fine shimmer-sheen. It applied with nearly opaque coverage, and despite having a lightly creamy texture, it actually applied quite evenly. The color lasted for five hours and didn‚Äôt feather on me (but this is not something I‚Äôm particularly prone to, so I would take that with a grain of salt!). The formula felt neither hydrating nor drying to me.",A-
URBAN DECAY,JUNKIE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúmetallic green shimmer with gold micro-sparkle [with a Metallized finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark cooler green with a lot of warmer, gold sparkle and shimmer. It had semi-opaque color payoff with a moderately emollient consistency that slid around slightly but was comfortable to wear and did not feather on me. It lasted for four hours and tended to gravitate towards lip lines after two hours of wear, but the more emollient texture made it more forgiving to smooth the color back into place. This shade is exclusive to Sephora.",C+
URBAN DECAY,HEROINE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúnavy blue [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a deep, navy blue with cool undertones and a satin finish. It was one of the more ‚Äúmatte‚Äù shades in the range and didn‚Äôt really look or feel like a cream It is officially listed as a Comfort Matte at launch. The color payoff was very nearly opaque, while the texture applied evenly for the most part, but it did have some areas where it wasn‚Äôt as pigmented as others, particularly around the edges for me. It wore well for five hours with slight color getting into my lip lines.",B+
URBAN DECAY,SAVAGE,Lipstick,"an ‚Äúelectric pink [with a Mega Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, bright, medium pink with cool, blue undertones and a mostly matte finish. The texture was thin but creamy enough not to drag on the lips, while the thinner texture highlighted lip lines to a minor degree. I noticed some of the color pooled into my lip lines after three hours of wear, though the color lasted closer to five hours in total. The formula was lightly drying.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,D750 FROSTED PEACH,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium, coral-orange with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. It had mostly opaque coverage with a soft, blendable consistency that was very smooth but had a dense feel and firmer press. The color wore well for nine hours but had some fall out.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,D830 BLACK ROSE,Eyeshadow,"a deep blackened purple with warmer undertones and a satiny sheen. It was intensely pigmented with a very cream-like, dense, buttery texture that applied well to bare skin (I actually think it applies better on bare skin than primer). This shade wore well for nine hours on me.",A+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,D850 NITRO PINK,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium pink with warmer undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. I originally thought it was a cheek-only color, though it is not listed on Sephora‚Äôs ‚Äúfor use on cheeks‚Äù section, which is why you‚Äôll see a cheek swatch for this one as well as a skin swatch! The texture was dense and cream-like, but it remained very pigmented and adheres well to the skin. As an eyeshadow, it works well, but as a blush, it is a little harder to get anything less than pretty intense coverage, and it was harder to really diffuse the edges to the degree that I typically do for blush. The texture also emphasized pores on cheeks. Note, since it‚Äôs not a cheek color, the rating reflects only its performance as an eyeshadow.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,D914 CRYSTALLINE MAUVE,Eyeshadow,"a very light lavender with a strong, white base and an iridescent sheen. It had semi-sheer color payoff, which was somewhat buildable, but it is definitely one of the least pigmented shimmery shades in the Artist range. I liked it best to brighten up the inner tearduct or along the lower lash line. The texture was dense but blendable, and the color lasted for eight hours on me.",B-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,D712 CREME BRULEE,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium copper with warm, orange undertones and a frsoted finish. It was richly pigmented with a cream-like, denser consistency that was firm to the touch but very, very smooth and blendable on the skin. The color wore well for nine hours before creasing slightly.",A
URBAN DECAY,FRENEMY,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright pink with blue shift [with a Comfort Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium fuchsia with strong, blue undertones and fine iridescent bluish-violet pearl. It had semi-opaque coverage and felt a lot more like the Metallized finish than a Comfort Matte finish, as it had more slip, a thinner feel, and was less cream-like. On me, this shade wore well for five hours, left behind a stain, and was lightly hydrating.",B+
URBAN DECAY,SHEER ANARCHY,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúfuchsia [with a Sheer finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-sheer color coverage‚Äìadds plenty of noticeable color while allowing the natural lip color to come through‚Äìand looks like a much darker fuchsia-pink on my lips than it appears initially swatched/in the tube. The texture had light cling, had some slip and was comfortable overall. The color lasted for five hours and lightly hydrating.",A
URBAN DECAY,CRUSH,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúhot pink [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium-dark fuchsia with cooler, blue undertones and a cream finish. It had great pigmentation with a creamy, moderately slippery consistency that glided on easily but didn‚Äôt slide around too much as the consistency wasn‚Äôt that thick. The color wore well for five and a half hours and was hydrating while worn.",A
URBAN DECAY,SHAME,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep berry [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a dark, burgundy red with subtle, warmer undertones and a glossy finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that went on fairly evenly (and a lot more evenly than the Revolution formula version), but some of the color gathered in lip lines, and it had some ‚Äúchunks‚Äù that didn‚Äôt seem to spread out. This shade wore well for five hours but feathered slightly on me. It was lightly hydrating overall.",B
URBAN DECAY,PDA,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright medium pink [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium pink with cooler, blue undertones and a cream finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff with a lightly creamy consistency that applied without tugging on the lips. It had a little more slip, which resulted in very subtle streaking around the edges or when I pressed my lips together. This shade lasted for four and a half hours and was hydrating.",A-
MAC,AIM FOR GORGEOUS,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright fuchsia [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a slightly muted, medium fuchsia-pink with blue undertones and a semi-matte to satin finish. It had great color payoff with a consistency that didn‚Äôt tug when applying, but it had a thicker feel to it that seemed more prone to clinging to the lips and exaggerating the texture of the lips. It was slightly drying over the five hours it lasted.",B+
MAC,BY SPECIAL ORDER,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep reddened fuchsia [with an Amplified finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, bright medium-dark pink-red with cooler undertones and fine pink pearl. It had mostly opaque coverage with a moderately creamy texture with some slip that applied evenly but didn‚Äôt slide around easily. On me, this shade lasted for over six hours, left behind a fuchsia-hued stain, and was slightly hydrating.",A
MAC,PRESSED AND READY,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúsoft whitened nude [with a Lustre finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light peach that leans slightly warmer, more orange-based than perfectly balanced, and it had fine, gold pearl. The texture was lightly emollient, a little stiffer in the tube until it warmed up against the lips, and applied with semi-opaque coverage‚Äìwhich is actually more coverage than most Lustres offer. The texture seemed to highlight lip lines as some of the color sunk into mine. This shade lasted for two and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",C+
MAC,STYLIST'S TIP,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep violet [with an Amplified finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a slightly muted, medium purple with warm, red undertones and a satin finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage with a lightly creamy consistency that applied without tugging and went on evenly. This shade wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",A-
MAC,COURTING SEDUCTION,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúcreamy pastel lavender [with an Amplified finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a very light lavender with cooler undertones and a natural sheen. It had good color payoff, though not fully opaque. The texture was lightly creamy with some slip, so it didn‚Äôt tug when applied, but the color pulled into lip lines over the four hours it lasted. It was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",B-
MAC,LURED IN,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúmid-tone pastel purple [with an Amplified finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, lavender purple with cooler undertones and a natural finish. It had mostly opaque coverage, but it had quite a bit of slip and tended to look uneven and streaky applied. The color gravitated towards my lip lines, and as the shine wore down, this seemed to get worse over time. This shade lasted for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B-
MAC,HEROINE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright purple [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, red-toned purple with warmer undertones and a semi-matte finish. This is part of the permanent range and has been released a few times before. It had mostly opaque coverage with a lightly creamy texture that applied without tugging but could have had a more flattering look at the end (seemed to emphasize the texture of my lips slightly). It is less matte than a previous tube of Heroine I have, as well. The color wore for over six hours and left a strong stain behind, while the formula felt neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
MAC,LUST EXTRACT,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep royal purple [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a deep, dark purple with cooler undertones and a very fine micro-shimmer that gives it a subtle sheen (it‚Äôs not matte at all!). The texture had some slip, which made it apply unevenly in places‚Äìit‚Äôs not the worst, but it would benefit greatly from a lip liner. The color lasted for five hours, and then it was reduced to a very strong, fuchsia-tinted stain. It was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
MAC,OMEGA,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúsoft muted beige-taupe [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, taupe brown with warmer undertones and a matte finish. The texture was soft, smooth, and blendable‚Äìdefinitely a MAC cult favorite for good reason‚Äìand adheres well to the skin without sheering out. It lasted well for eight hours on me before creasing slightly.",A-
MAC,ERA,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúsoft golden beige with shimmer [with a Satin finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium brown with warm, golden undertones and a soft, pearly sheen. The texture was slightly stiffer to work with, which resulted in more semi-opaque payoff, though it seemed buildable in practice. It was still blendable and sat well on the skin. This shade wore well for eight hours.",B
MAC,HONESTY,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúpewtered bronze [with a Lustre finish].‚Äù It has a cooler, taupe-brown base with warmer, coppery shimmer and sparkle. The two don‚Äôt seem to bind together, so you‚Äôre left with this sheerer, taupe base and then an uneven application of the sparkle/shimmer that seems to fly away as it is blended out. This one is a miss for me; it is really difficult to use without a lightly tacky primer and then patted into place (avoid blending!). What did adhere to the skin lasted for seven hours.",F
MAC,PATINA,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äútaupe brown with golden pearl [with a Frost finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, more antique-y gold with warm undertones and a soft, frosted finish. The texture was soft, smooth, and blendable, while the color payoff was fully opaque. I remember loving the dimension of this one many years ago, and it is interesting that it remains harder to dupe because it is muted, browner, but still warmer than most taupes (but cooler than most golds). It wore well for eight and a half hours before creasing slightly.",A
MAC,TEMPTING,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúsinfully rich coco [with a Lustre finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark bronzy brown with warm, copper undertones and a golden frosted shimmer. If you normally dislike Lustres, this is one of the least-Lustre-like shades (and as a result, it is marked down for pigmentation, as it is opaque not sheerer like Lustres are designed to be). It has less shimmer and opaque coverage, and the texture is much smoother and less loose/chunky; to me, it is more similar to a cross between Frost and Veluxe Pearl with slightly more sparkle. On me, the color wore well for eight hours with some fall out.",B
MAC,WOODWINKED,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúwarm antique gold [with a Veluxe Pearl finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a rich, dark coppery-brown with warm, reddish undertones and a metallic sheen. It was intensely pigmented with a smooth, buttery, and dense texture that was easy to use and applied beautifully to bare skin. The color lasted for eight hours before creasing faintly.",A
MAC,PHLOOF!,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúfrosted off-white [with a Frost finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, pinky-white with subtle, warmer undertones and a frosted sheen. It is one of the brighter and more metallic lighter, neutral shades MAC has in its permanent line. The texture was denser, firm but not stiff, and had good pigmentation with a blendable texture that adhered well to bare skin. It wore well for eight hours before creasing slightly.",B+
MAC,VAPOUR,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúpeach-pink with violet pearl [with a Velvet finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, warmer beige base with cool, iridescent blue shimmer, which gives it a cooler-toned look as a result. The texture was fairly soft, just a bit dusty, but remained blendable and easy to use on the lid. It wore well for eight hours on me.",B+
MAC,ORB,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúsoft peachy-beige [with a Satin finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a very light peach with a satin finish. It had good color payoff, though not fully opaque, that was buildable and blendable on the skin. The texture was a smidgen on the drier side, but it didn‚Äôt emphasize the texture of my lids/skin. On me, it wore well for eight hours.",B+
MAC,GRAIN,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúgolden beige with icy shimmer [with a Satin finish].‚Äù It had great color payoff with a soft, smooth, and blendabe consistency that was neither too firm nor too soft in the pan. The color applied well to bare skin and lasted for a good eight hours before fading.",A-
URBAN DECAY,UPTIGHT,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúwarm nude [with a Comfort Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, peachy brown with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had fully opaque color payoff in a single stroke, and the color applied evenly due to the very creamy, smooth consistency. I noticed that the texture seemed to emphasize lip lines just slightly after I applied, but it did worsen as the color wore off (over a four and a half hour period) as the color gathered into lip lines.",B+
URBAN DECAY,1993,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúmedium brown [with a Comfort Matte finish.]‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark brown with warmer, slightly orange-y undertones and a satiny sheen. It had rich color payoff that covered the lips with smooth, even coverage. The texture was very creamy, lightweight, and comfortable to wear and never tugged on the lips when applied from the tube. On me, the color lasted for five hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
URBAN DECAY,BACKDOOR,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúfrosted dusty brown [with a Metallized finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, reddish brown with warmer undertones and a lot of fine pearl. It had mostly opaque pigmentation where the natural lip color came through very slightly, but this was one of the more pigmented Metallized shades. The texture was also a bit denser than most of the Metallized range, though it was still thinner than a Cream and had more slip. It lasted for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",A-
URBAN DECAY,CONSPIRACY,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúplum-bronze shimmer [with a Metallized finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs an intense, deep reddish-brown with warmer undertones and a lot of fine, copper pearl. Like Backdoor, it was more pigmented than not with a lightly creamy texture that applied easily and went on smoothly but could have been a smidgen more even on. This shade lasted for five hours and was lightly hydrating.",A-
URBAN DECAY,NIGHTHAWK,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbrown-red [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a deep, reddish brown with warmer undertones and a creamy, lightly glossy finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff, though there was a slight translucency to the color. This could look even redder if you have naturally red-tinted lips. The texture was lightweight, moderately emollient, and glided on without tugging, but it felt more slippery than most shades in the finish. I didn‚Äôt personally experience feathering, but it has enough slip that it might be an issue for others. This shade wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating.",A-
URBAN DECAY,CRIMINAL,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúsoft pink-nude [with a Comfort Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium pink with neutral-to-warm undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage that went mostly evenly (it could have been a little smoother on the lips) with a very creamy, lightweight texture that glided on without tugging. It lasted for four hours on me with some color gathering into my lip lines after two and a half hours of wear. The formula was neither drying nor hydrating.",B
URBAN DECAY,REJECTED,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúpearly rose-pink [with a Metallized finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, rosy pink with subtle, cooler undertones and fine pearl. It had semi-sheer color payoff, and as a result, it had more in common with the Sheer finish than the Cream finish. The texture had moderate slip and had a thinner feel to it compared to the Creams, which are denser. It lasted for three hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",B-
URBAN DECAY,WRONG NUMBER,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúsoft neutral pink [with a Sheer finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium pink with neutral-to-warm undertones and a natural shine. It had semi-sheer color coverage that applied evenly for the most part, but some of the color seemed to gather into lip lines. The color is closer to my natural lip color, so it isn‚Äôt as obvious as it would be with a deeper shade, but it may look better/worse depending on how it contrasts with your natural lip color. The color lasted for three hours and was lightly hydrating.",B
URBAN DECAY,SHEER LIAR,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúpink-nude [with a Sheer finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark rosy brown with warmer undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-sheer color coverage that applied evenly with a lightweight texture and moderate slip. The texture is thin but not so thin that it clings or feels a little dry. The formula was hydrating and wore for three and a half hours on me.",A-
URBAN DECAY,RAVENSWOOD,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdusty rose with red undertone [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark rosy plum with warm undertones and a creamy, lightly glossy finish. It had mostly opaque coverage with a creamy, light-medium-weight texture that applied easily, hugged the lips without feeling clingy, and was comfortable to wear. This shade wore well for four and a half hours on me, and it was hydrating while worn.",A
CHANEL,DUO N. 02,Palette,"a highlighting and contouring powder duo that gives a ‚Äúsheer, natural finish.‚Äù Between the two duos offered, this is the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù one, but it still falls noticeably short when it comes to being blendable and easy to use. I just think that the texture is far too firm, too stiff, and it translates into application, which is where it really counts. For some, this might be a happy accident, but the darker ‚Äúcontour‚Äù shade here is far from ‚Äúsheer.‚Äù",C+
MAC,CUSHY LIFE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúlight warm golden beige.‚Äù It‚Äôs a sparkling, medium copper with warm undertones. It had sheer to semi-sheer color payoff with a slightly drier texture that made it hard to apply it at anything more than wash of all-over color. It does make me concerned about how it might work over time, as it might get a little drier over months. The color lasted for ten hours and had faint fall out.",C+
MAC,JEALOUS GIRL,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúmint green.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium green with warm undertones and a sparkling, golden sheen. It had sheer to semi-opaque color payoff with a fairly smooth consistency that was very blendable, but it tended to thicken on the lid and emphhasize the lid‚Äôs texture if attempted to be worn at more opaque coverage. The color lasted for ten hours with very minimal fall out.",B+
MAC,BIG BAD BLUE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúsoft pastel blue.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium blue with cool undertones and a sparkling finish. It had sheer to semi-sheer pigmentation; it always appeared several shades lighter applied than it did in the pot. The texture was a smidgen dry but workable. This shade wore well for ten hours without fading or creasing.",B-
MAC,PLEAD GILTY,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúvibrant sparkling gold.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, glittering white gold with warm, yellow tones and a very glittery finish. This was the most glittery shade out of the eleven I tested. The texture isn‚Äôt really rough going on, but it is better applied as more of a wash than trying to make it opaque on the lid. It‚Äôs buildable from sheer to semi-sheer, but it can look uneven easily. The color wore well for ten hours without creasing or fading, but there was a moderate amount of fall out over time.",B-
MAC,"SO, SO SAUCY",Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúmid-tone peach.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, peach with warm, yellow undertones and a sparkling, frosted finish. It had sheer to semi-opaque color payoff, and this was one of the shades that had a drier consistency and applied that way‚Äìit was very easily ‚Äúbunched‚Äù where the product would overlap onto itself in some places and lift color up from other areas, so it appeared quite uneven. What did apply certainly lasted as long as the rest of the shades‚Äìten hours‚Äìbut was a pain to apply.",B
MAC,QUITE YUMMY!,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúlight pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium rosy copper with warm undertones and a frosted shimmer-sheen finish. This shade didn‚Äôt have as much sparkle as some shades, so it might feel more subdued as a result. It had better color payoff, ranging from medium to totally opaque. The color was blendable, long-wearing (over ten hours), and easy to apply.",A
MAC,SOFTENED UP,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúmid-tone warm brown.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, bronzy brown with warm, golden tones and shimmer. It had semi-sheer to opaque color payoff (about two layers or just applied more heavily). The texture was a little ‚Äúwetter‚Äù compared to most shades, but it still had more of a powder-like texture on the skin once applied. I didn‚Äôt see any creasing or fading after ten hours of wear.",A
URBAN DECAY,RAPTURE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdusty rose [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a soft, medium-dark rosy plum with neutral-to-warm undertones and a creamy finish. It had nearly opaque color payoff with a smooth, creamy texture that glided on without tugging but sat well on the lips and didn‚Äôt slide around too much. The formula is forgiving and seems to minimize the appearance of lip lines. On me, it wore well for four and a half hours and was nicely hydrating.",A
URBAN DECAY,CRISIS,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúplum-rose [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark plum with subtle, warmer undertones and a cream finish. It had opaque color coverage with a creamy, smooth consistency that applied beautifully and had a soft shine but wasn‚Äôt so slippery that it slid around. The formula was comfortable to wear, moderately hydrating, and lasted for four and a half hours.",A
URBAN DECAY,TAMPERED,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep mauve [with a Comfort Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark rosy plum with warmer undertones and a satiny sheen. It had great pigmentation that fully covered the lips, while the texture was lightweight, smooth, and very creamy‚Äìit glided on easily. The color sat well in the lips and didn‚Äôt settle into lip lines. It lasted for four and a half hours on me and was very lightly hydrating.",A
URBAN DECAY,SAFE WORD,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúneutral nude-pink [with a Comfort Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, rosy beige with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had opaque pigmentation with a very creamy, smooth texture that applied easily and seemed to develop a dewier finish as it sat on the lips (after a minute). The texture was comfortable to wear and lightly hydrating. over the four hours it lasted, but some of the color separates into lip lines as it wears away.",B+
URBAN DECAY,PEYOTE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúmetallic dusty mauve-rose [with a Metallized finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark rosy brown with warm undertones and fine gold and rose pearl. The texture was soft, lightly pliable and applied without dragging or skipping; it didn‚Äôt seem to need time to ‚Äúmelt‚Äù in order to apply well, though the texture seems to soften even more as it is applied. It had semi-opaque color coverage, where the natural lip color will still come through and can influence how the color looks overall. It was lightly hydrating and lasted for three hours on me.",B
MAKEUP GEEK,CHIT CHAT,Eyeshadow,"a slightly muted, medium periwinkle with strong, cool undertones and a pearly sheen. It seemed really promising, but it was surprisingly hard to work with, especially for a shimmer‚Äìit had a dustiness to it that made it hard to apply evenly. I could only get it to apply decently with a damp brush. It lasted for seven hours on me.",C+
MAKEUP GEEK,PILLOW TALK,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium, mauve-y lavender with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. The texture was very thin and dusty‚Äìand it was a color that seemed to change with each layer, almost as if it wasn‚Äôt mixed well or the colors weren‚Äôt binding, because sometimes it was lavender and other times it was reddish.",B-
MAKEUP GEEK,TOXIC,Eyeshadow,"a blackened-brown base and a pearly sheen. It had good pigmentation, though not fully opaque, with a fairly blendable and smooth texture that wasn‚Äôt too dusty. It applied well to the skin and lasted for eight hours.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,REBEL,Eyeshadow,"a medium, bluish gray base with warmer, gold and brown shimmer. The shimmer separates away from the base color when blended; even just patted on it, it was hard to keep the shimmer in place for an even finish/application. I think with an adhesive base and lots of patting and packing on, it could be quite interesting, as it was harder to dupe, but I‚Äôm surprised they released something that felt so unfinished. The color lasted for six and a half hours.",C+
MAKEUP GEEK,HOT PANTS,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium, pinky lavender with warm undertones and a frosted sheen. It had good color payoff with a soft, smooth consistency that was just a smidgen dusty but was otherwise easy to work with. It wore well for eight hours on me.",A-
CLE DE PEAU,GOLDEN APRICOT,Highlighter,"a light-medium peach with warm, orange undertones and a dusting of warm white shimmer and occasional sparkle.",A
CLE DE PEAU,MODERN PINK (2),Lipgloss,"a soft, peachy-pink base with a lot of fine, peachy-gold shimmer.",A-
COLOUR POP,SHE BAD,Lipstick,"a medium peach with warm, orange-brown tones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage with a lightweight, velvety consistency that was easy to maneuver and apply across the lips. The texture seemed to emphasize the natural texture of my lips, and it appeared ‚Äúcracked‚Äù slightly when I smiled or widened my mouth. The color lasted for five and a half hours and started to feel drying after four hours of wear.",B+
COLOUR POP,CAMI,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark rosy plum with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had great pigmentation with a creamy, velvety-smooth consistency that applied without tugging. The texture was less forgiving and did accentuate the natural texture of my lips, so if you have lips prone to cracking/peeling/flaking, this might be a flattering formula on. The color wore well for six hours and was lightly drying over time.",A-
COLOUR POP,TICKLER,Lipstick,"a bold, bright medium fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a matte finish. It had opaque color payoff with a very smooth, velvety texture that applied without tugging or dragging. I was surprised that the color appeared slightly ‚Äúcracked‚Äù despite being a darker/brighter shade, though it was not as apparent as it was in She Bad. The color lasted for over seven hours and was lightly drying after five hours.",A-
COLOUR POP,BOA,Lipstick,"a light-medium, pinky lavender with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had opaque color payoff, but the texture ‚Äúcracked‚Äù visibly on me from the get-go, even though it had seemingly good coverage and didn‚Äôt drag at all (very velvety applied). The color wore six hours with the color still remaining ‚Äúcracked‚Äù but didn‚Äôt seem to work into lip lines from there. It was drying after six hours.",B+
COLOUR POP,BACK UP,Lipstick,"a muted, purpled plum with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good color payoff with even, smooth coverage that applied without tugging or dragging on the lips. The color lasted for seven hours and was lightly drying.",A
COLOUR POP,CLIMAX,Lipstick,"a slightly muted, deep purpled-blue with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff, but it could have been richer for true, one-stroke opaque coverage. The texture felt smooth and glided on without dragging, but the thinner consistency seemed prone to emphasizing lip lines and natural texture of my lips. The color lasted for six and a half hours with slightly uneven fading overall. The biggest upside is the non-liquid format makes it easier to apply around the edges.",B+
ANASTASIA,CUSTARD,Eyeshadow,"a meduim, yellowed beige with warm undertones and a matte finish. It is pretty aptly named, actually. The texture was lightly dusty, though blendable, with semi-opaque color payoff. This one faded more quickly than some of the recent shades‚Äìafter six and a half hours‚Äìso I would recommend a primer as a must-have with this shade.",B-
ANASTASIA,CARAMEL,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, yellowed brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had decent color payoff, which wasn‚Äôt opaque but remained buildable in practice. The texture was soft, smooth, and lightly dusty overall. The color lasted for eight hours before fading on me.",B
ANASTASIA,COPPER SHIMMER,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark orange-copper with warm undertones and a pearly finish. It had great pigmentation, but the texture was drier, which led to some issues when blending out as it would appear a little more uneven and some of the shimmer would result in fall out. The color lasted for eight hours after applied without any more fall out.",B+
ANASTASIA,RICH BROWN,Eyeshadow,"a dark brown with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had decent to good pigmentation with a soft, lightly dusty texture that could have blended more easily (particularly for such a dark shade). I had better luck building it up slowly and blending it out in steps rather than applying with more product and then drying to diffuse. It lasted for eight hours before fading.",B
MAC,WILD HORSES,Palette,"four shades‚Äìtwo of which are part of the permanent range. The blue is an interesting addition, as it is a very neutral set of shades otherwise. It had good quality overall with nice color payoff and eight-hour wear.",B+
LAURA MERCIER,ICED POMEGRANATE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, reddish plum with subtle, warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had mostly opaque color payoff with a very smooth, creamy, and balm-like texture that was fairly emollient. The texture is thin enough that it doesn‚Äôt feel slippery, but feathering might be a concern for those more prone to it (I didn‚Äôt experience it, to be clear). This shade lasted for four and a half hours on me and was hydrating.",A
LAURA MERCIER,CINNFUL,Lipstick,"a muted, medium rosy brown with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had mostly opaque color payoff with a creamy, lightweight texture that glided on and felt very nourishing while worn. The color wore for three and a half hours on me.",A-
LAURA MERCIER,RED VELVET,Lipstick,"a bright, pinky-red with subtle, warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had mostly opaque pigmentation, though there was a little more translucency across the board. The consistency was creamy and smooth, which made it comfortable to wear and apply, and I noticed this shade had a bit less slip than the other two. It lasted for four and a half hours on me and was moisturizing over time.",A-
SURRATT BEAUTY,ANGELIQUE,Blush,"a soft, muted, medium-dark coppery orange with warm undertones and a frosted sheen.",A
ANASTASIA,TOUCH OF LILAC,Eyeshadow,"a very light, muted pink with a soft, frosted finish. It‚Äôs not really lilac to me‚Äìit is much warmer than that. It had good color payoff with a soft, blendable texture that wasn‚Äôt too soft or too firm, so it applied well to the lid and didn‚Äôt lose its coverage when blended. The color started to fade after eight hours of wear.",B+
ANASTASIA,ELECTRO,Eyeshadow,"an iridescent, medium pinky lavender with subtle, cool undertones and a frosted sheen. It had semi-opaque color payoff with a soft, lightly dusty consistency that is a bit dry to work with, so there is some fall out and sheerness without a good primer or base in place. The color lasted for seven and a half hours.",B-
ANASTASIA,STAR COBALT,Eyeshadow,"a bold, medium-dark navy blue with cool undertones and a metallic sheen. It had really intense pigmentation, but its downfall was the very dense consistency‚Äìit felt more like a cream than a powder eyeshadow‚Äìwhich made it harder to blend out and apply to the lid. I would recommend a flat, firm synthetic brush for this one, and then using a softer blending brush after initial application. The color itself started to crease after eight hours of wear.",B+
ANASTASIA,RICH VELVET,Eyeshadow,"a deep, burgundy-brown with warm, reddish undertones and a smattering of white micro-sparkle over a mostly matte finish. Applied, it looks more matte than anything else as a lot of the sparkle doesn‚Äôt transfer to the lid. It had good color payoff with a soft, smooth consistency that was easy to blend on the skin. It wore well for eight hours on me.",A-
LAURA MERCIER,EXTREME NEUTRALS,Palette,"a set of twelve shades with a general neutral-leaning vibe. Two shades‚Äìboth in the purple family‚Äìare the only non-standard neutrals (your browns, beiges, etc.). There are so many neutral palettes available that it seems like any new-to-market palette should be exceptionally high quality in order to compete with all those other neutral palettes, and this one isn‚Äôt. There are several shades that miss here, primarily with respect to pigmentation and texture.",B-
BECCA COSMETICS,BLUSHED COPPER,Blush,"a medium-dark copper-brown with warm undertones and a sparkling, frosted finish.",B+
COLOUR POP,JUJUROUGE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeepened berry red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark red with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. It had very nearly opaque color coverage‚Äìyou can see my lip freckle just peeking through‚Äìthat covered evenly and smoothly. The consistency was lightly creamy and applied without dragging on the lips. It wore well for six and a half hours, left behind a moderate stain, and was slightly drying after four hours of wear.",A
COLOUR POP,POLITE SOCIETY,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúwarm peach.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, peachy-orange with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff with a lightly creamy consistency that tugged at the lips a little bit but was not uncomfortable once applied. The color lasted for four and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating. I noticed some of the color gathered into lip lines noticeably after two hours of wear.",B
VISEART,BOHEME DREAM (RIBBONS BOHEME),Palette,"a new, limited edition palette for summer that features a slightly lighter (almost pastel-like but not quite light enough, at least not to me) take on a ‚Äúbrights‚Äù palette. All twelve shades are shimmery, and they vary from pearly to metallic (most are somewhere between frost and metallic). The twelve shades do work together to create looks, but you‚Äôll likely want to add-in your favorite mattes/satins to get more dimension and depth out of the palette. The color payoff was good to great with soft, blendable texture that wore well; a few shades were a little looser in press (not quite as dense as the metallic shades in the newer Theory palettes) but were all easy to work with on the lid.",A
COLOUR POP,BROOKLYN,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright hot pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, bright, medium-dark warm, fuchsia pink with a semi-matte finish. It was rich color payoff with full coverage that applied evenly. The consistency was thin and then ‚Äúdried‚Äù to a mostly matte finish‚Äìless satiny than many others shades in the formula‚Äìthat was lightly tacky but didn‚Äôt lift color when I pressed my lips together. The color was still going strong after seven hours of wear, and it was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
COLOUR POP,SO WAVY,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúvibrant blue purple.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, bright, medium-dark violet purple with strong, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage with a thin, spreadable consistency, but the texture was noticeably thinner than other shades in the same formula. It was more prone to emphasizing lip lines, and it‚Äôs one that I would recommend applying a second pass of for greater opacity and a smoother, overall finish. The color still wore for over six hours with even fading, but it was a little drying.",B+
MAC,TATTOO MY HEART,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúbright pinky coral.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, orange-coral with warm undertones that gets rosier when it ‚Äúsets‚Äù on the lips. The texture was thin, watery and developed into a slightly thicker, more gel-like consistency after a minute or two. It was unforgiving, though, as the gloss gathered in lip lines. It had mostly opaque coverage and lasted for six hours. It was somewhat drying.",B-
MAC,TRULY EVERLASTING,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúbright warm pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium pinky-coral with warm undertones that darkens as it sets into a redder coral. It had mostly opaque coverage with smooth application that didn‚Äôt emphasize lip lines much. The color wore well for seven hours and was moderately drying over time.",A-
MAC,FOREVER DARLING,Lipgloss,"an ‚Äúintense orange red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, bright, medium-dark red-orange with warm undertones and a creamy finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff with a smooth, lightweight texture that glided on, set evenly, and didn‚Äôt emphasize lip lines. The color wore for the full eight hours promised, but it was slightly drying overall.",A
LORAC,DAYLIGHT,Highlighter,"a light-medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a pearly sheen.",A
MAC,DOO WOP,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúpink pop.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium fuchsia-magenta with strong, blue undertones and a satin finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff with a lightly creamy consistency that glided across the lips without tugging or dragging. It lasted for five hours on me and left a stain behind. The formula was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
MAC,MIND CONTROL,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright cherry red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium red with subtle, cool undertones and barely-there pearl. It had mostly opaque coverage, but there was a translucency to the color that gave it a lighter-weight appearance on (a little more like a stain). The texture was lightweight, emollient without being slippery, and comfortable to wear. On me, it wore for five and a half hours and left a stain behind. It was very lightly hydrating.",A
MAC,WHIRL,Lipstick,"MAC Whirl Lipstick ($18.00 for 0.10 oz.) is described as a ‚Äúdirty rose.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark rosy brown with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had good pigmentation‚Äìalmost opaque‚Äìwith a creamy texture that applied without dragging. The consistency seemed more emollient than the last version of Whirl I tried (which had a more velvety feel). It caught a bit more in lip lines, especially after two hours of wear, though it lasted for four and a half hours overall.",A-
MAC,WITCHING HOUR,Lipstick,"A ‚Äúrich purple.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, deep purple with cool undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a moderately emollient texture that had slipped around slightly‚Äìand it applied unevenly with color gathering in lip lines. If it had less slip, I think it would apply better. It lasted for four hours and was neither hydrating nor drying on me. With a lip liner, I expect this to be workable.",B
LORAC,STARLIGHT,Highlighter,a pale gold with warm undertones and a pearly sheen.,A
MAC,FLY BY TWILIGHT,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äútaupe.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium pewter with warm undertones and a frosted, metallic sheen.",A-
COLOUR POP,HONEYDUDE,Eyeliner,"a ‚Äúcreamy warm nude.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light peachy-beige with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque pigmentation in a single stroke, and it adhered well to both the waterline and lower lash line. It wore well for seven hours on the waterline, nine hours on the lower lash line.",A-
COLOUR POP,TEASPOON,Eyeliner,"an ‚Äúintense emerald green.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark green with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff in a single pass, which may have been due to the texture that felt a little drier compared to other shades I‚Äôve tried in this formula. It builds up fairly well, so opaque coverage is possible. The color lasted for eight hours on me.",B
COLOUR POP,DESCANSO,Eyeliner,"a ‚Äúbright purple.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, bright, medium-dark violet purple with cool undertones and bluish micro-glitter. It had mostly opaque color payoff with a creamy consistency that wasn‚Äôt too heavy, nor did it take too long to dry (it is quicker-drying). The color is so vibrant and pops well on the lash line, but I had issues with the glitter and color flaking on me over time, even though much of the color remained visible for over eight hours.",B-
MAC,BOYFRIEND STEALER,Lipstick,a ‚Äúblackened plum [with a Cremesheen finish].,C
NARS,DEEP END,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúshimmering teal-green.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark teal with subtle, cooler undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-sheer coverage dry, while damp application yielded mostly opaque coverage that had a stronger, smoother sheen. The texture was fairly smooth but slightly firm in the pan, and I had trouble getting true-to-pan, opaque coverage out of this (even when used with a damp brush) as it kept fading down and didn‚Äôt blend out evenly. It lasted for six hours before creasing on me.",C+
NARS,POOL SHARK,Eyeshadow,"an ‚Äúiridescent periwinkle.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium periwinkle blue with cool undertones and a frosted finish. It had sheer coverage that leaned purpler when applied dry. The color was brighter and bluer when applied damp, and the coverage level was nearly opaque. It applied decently to the lid, but it seemed to fade some as it dried down (from damp application). This shade lasted for seven hours on me.",B-
NARS,TAN LINES,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúrich hazelnut.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark brown with soft, warm undertones and a frosted sheen. It had good color payoff both dry and damp‚Äìit became a little darker and more opaque damp. The texture was soft, smooth, and blendable, while the eyeshadow lasted for seven and a half hours.",B
NARS,TOPLESS,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúseashell pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a very light, pinky-peach with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation applied dry, while damp application yielded opaque coverage. The powder had a soft, smooth, blendable consistency that was easy to use on the lid. The color lasted for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
MAC,CONSTANT CRAVING,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúmid-tone blue pink.‚Äù It comes out of the tube as a light-medium, bluish pink with a cream finish, but it ‚Äúsets‚Äù and yields a slightly darker, more fuchsia-tinted pink, though it still had a lot of the milky quality of the initial color still present. The texture was a little thicker overall, and this one applied messily‚Äìit was uneven and settled into lines very easily. This was one of the worst-applying of the ones I‚Äôve tried thus far. The color lasted for six hours and was drying over time.",C
MAC,CEASELESS ENERGY,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúbright raspberry pink.‚Äù Fresh from the tube, it is a bright, medium cotton candy pink with strong blue undertones, which develops into a medium-dark, raspberry pink with cool, blue undertones. The color applied smoothly and yielded semi-opaque coverage, but some of the color settled into lip lines. On me, the color lasted for six and a half hours and was lightly drying.",B+
MAC,PRESERVING PASSION,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúdeep wine.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, reddish plum with subtle, cool undertones. It had semi-opaque coverage that applied evenly and smoothly. The color lasted for the full eight hours and was slightly drying.",A
NARS,SEXUAL CONTENT,Palette,"a new, limited edition duo for summer. Both shades had sheerer, softer color and shimmer applied dry and richer, deeper, and more metallic color when applied damp. The shades work well together, if one wants to layer or use the lighter shade as more of a highlighter and the darker shade to define the cheek.",B+
KAT VON D,SMOKE,Palette,"four shades designed to work together and are named to help guide application‚ÄìBase, Define, Contour, and Highlight‚Äìthough you can obviously go wherever your creativity takes you. If you couldn‚Äôt guess from the title, this is your traditional ‚Äúsmoky eye‚Äù pairing, though I think the more taupe-y gray gives it something more interesting than standard silver.",B
BECCA COSMETICS,SNAPDRAGON,Blush,"a medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a soft, golden shimmer.",A-
SEPHORA,MINNIE-ATURE,Palette,"five, miniature-sized Cream Lip Stains. The formula is supposed to be ‚Äúlong-lasting‚Äù with ‚Äúhigh-coverage.‚Äù It is a liquid lipstick that goes on looking wet and lightly glossy but dries down to a matte finish. The consistency was a little watery and thin, and I had issues with the color streaking when applying, but a lot of it seemed to self-level as the product dried down. They lasted between four and seven hours, while the formula was lightly drying. There is a strong, sweet, fruity scent that lingered for an hour after drying down. The names might not seem particularly Disney-inspired, and that‚Äôs because they aren‚Äôt‚Äìthese shades are from the Cream Lip Stain range.",B+
SEPHORA,MINNIE'S WORLD IN COLOR,Palette,"20 eyeshadows ranging from neutrals to pops of color. The formula is described as ‚Äúcreamy‚Äù and ‚Äúsuper pigmented.‚Äù Both the mirror and the eyeshadows pop out so that the packaging can be used as a clutch. There are some nice shades in the palette, but there are quite a few misses‚Äìparticularly brighter pops of color with more satin to pearl finishes. The best shades tended to be very shimmery or metallic.",C+
KAT VON D,RUST,Palette,"four shades designed to work together and are named to help guide application‚ÄìBase, Define, Contour, and Highlight‚Äìthough you can obviously go wherever your creativity takes you. This is a warmer, richer take on neutrals, because of the inclusion of the more darker orange shade.",B+
LAURA MERCIER,SEDUCTION,Highlighter,"a medium-dark, coppery-brown with warm undertones and a gold, frosted sheen.",A
TOO FACED,MISO PRETTY,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúmatte soft ballet slipper pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, peachy-pink with subtle, warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. It was very chalky once it dried down, and it looked ‚Äúcracked‚Äô as soon as I smiled, but worse, it remained visibly separated even when I relaxed my mouth (you can see that in the swatch). It had no staying power‚Äìit broke down within four hours‚Äìfor a fully dry, liquid lipstick formula. The consistency was clingy and was drying over time.",C-
TOO FACED,QUEEN B,Lipstick,"Too Faced Queen B Melted Matte Liquid Lipstick ($21.00 for 0.23 fl. oz.) is described as a ‚Äúmatte soft mauve.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium mauve with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It applied fairly well, but I couldn‚Äôt keep it from separating once the color dried down, so it emphasized lip lines and made the color easier to flake and fade. It lasted for four and a half hours and was drying.",B-
TOO FACED,MRS. ROPER,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúmatte bright tangerine.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, neon, medium orange with warm, yellow undertones and a matte finish. It had great color payoff with a thin consistency that applied evenly without issue, but once it dried down, the color separated and made the lips look ‚Äúcracked‚Äù whenever I smiled or widened my mouth at all. There‚Äôs something about the dry down of this formula that just seems to sit poorly on my lips; I usually only have major issues with the color separating at dry down with lighter shades, if I do. The color lasted for five hours and started to flake off, and this one was quite drying.",B
TOO FACED,NAUGHTY BY NATURE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúmatte deep chocolate.‚Äù It‚Äôs a dark brown with warm undertones and a satin finish. This shade never quite dried down; it was lightly tacky but pressing my lips together didn‚Äôt lift color, so that was a happy surprise! It had rich pigmentation and applied evenly. It emphasized lip lines but didn‚Äôt look as ‚Äúcracked‚Äù when I smiled as other shades. It‚Äôs not ideal, but it was one of the easier shades to wear over time. The formula was moderately drying over the five hours it lasted.",B+
LAURA GELLER,PEACH GLOW,Highlighter,a ‚Äúpeachy champagne shimmer.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light peach with warm undertones and a metallic sheen.,B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,BRONZE AGE,Bronzer,"a muted, medium-dark caramel brown with warm, yellow undertones and a matte finish.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,REVOLVE AROUND ME,Lipstick,"a light-medium peachy-beige with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It had semi-opaque color coverage that applied fairly evenly, but it was the least even of the six (it also seemed the least pigmented). Some of the color gathered and emphasized lip lines when applied. I think this one would benefit from a lip liner or filling primer. It wore for three hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",C-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,SOLAR AFFAIR,Lipstick,"a medium, coral-orange with warm undertones and a creamy, lightly shiny finish. This one had a heavier, more cream-like appearance than other shades, which looked more like stains than traditional lipstick. The texture was a little denser and thicker on. It had nearly opaque coverage as well. The color wore for four hours and was hydrating.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,TEMPTATION WAITS,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark plummy brown with warm undertones and fine gold micro-shimmer dusted through it. It had mostly opaque coverage, though there‚Äôs a translucency there that allows some of the tones of the natural lip color to still influence the end result. The consistency was lightweight, emollient, and comfortable to wear with light hydration over the four and a half hours it lasted.",B
MAC,DARK ENERGY,Palette,"a bluish take on a smoky eye‚Äìa mix of silvery white, pale blue, light-medium blue, and black. The first three shades were decent, while the last shade was a pain to work with for a myriad of reasons. The Mineralize Eyeshadow formula is wet/dry, and it is designed to have sheerer coverage applied dry while stronger color payoff requires working with the product using a damp brush; this isn‚Äôt always an extra step everyone wants to do, but it‚Äôs absolutely necessary with this palette if you want opaque coverage, so keep that in mind!",C+
MAC,NUANCED,Blush,"a mix of a light gold, peach, copper, and rose gold. Together, they create a light-medium, peachy copper with warm undertones and a frosted sheen.",B
LAURA MERCIER,ROS√©,Highlighter,"a medium, peachy-copper with warm, pink and gold shimmer that give it a frosted finish",B
ZOEVA,GLANCE,Eyeliner,"a dark, bronzy brown with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It was intensely pigmented with a really creamy, smooth consistency that applied evenly and easily. This shade wore well for eight and a half hours on me.",A
ZOEVA,MYTH,Eyeliner,"a light, champagne beige with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-sheer color coverage in one stroke, which was somewhat buildable, but the texture, while very smooth and non-tugging, felt waxier and was harder to achieve really crisp, opaque lines with. The color had noticeably faded after seven and a half hours.",B-
ZOEVA,OPULENCE,Eyeliner,"a vibrant, medium-dark coppery red with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-opaque coverage in one pass, which was buildable to opaque coverage in two layers. The texture was smooth and creamy, so it glided on easily and didn‚Äôt tug at the lash line. The color lasted for eight and a half hours on me.",B+
ZOEVA,ROCK 'N' ROLL BRIDE,Eyeliner,"a blackened brown with warm, reddish undertones and fine ruby red shimmer. It had good pigmentation in one stroke, and it was creamy, though a little more slippery than it needed to be, and glided on well. This shade lasted for eight and a half hours before thinning.",A-
ZOEVA,THE TRUTH,Eyeliner,"a bright, shimmering white with neutral-to-cool undertones. It had semi-opaque coverage but was hard to build up as it would apply unevenly, so some areas looked more opaque but denser/thicker than others. The color itself stayed on for eight hours.",B-
ESTEE LAUDER,MAUVE MYSTIQUE,Blush,"a medium, pinky-plum with subtle, warm undertones and white sparkle.",B+
TOO FACED,WHEN IN DOUBT,Lipstick,"a light-medium, rosy beige with a semi-matte finish. It had mostly opaque coverage with a drier, draggy texture that applied evenly but looked dry and highlighted the natural texture of the lips. The color started to gather in lip lines after a half hour, and by two hours of wear, the color itself looked uneven in places. It lasted for three hours in total and was moderately drying.",C-
TOO FACED,SORRY NOT SORRY,Lipstick,"a light-medium peach with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had a medium-thick texture that had a dryness to it that reminded me of chalk, and it was extremely unforgiving as it emphasized lip lines and immediately pulled into them. The color looked ‚Äúcracked‚Äù as soon as smiled‚Äìmuch as they can with matte liquid lipsticks‚Äìand was all-around difficult to make it look decent. I would recommend a lip primer and/or lip liner with this one. It lasted for two and a half hours on me and was lightly drying (wore it twice in a row to test hydration).",D
TOO FACED,THE NEW BLACK,Lipstick,"a muted, medium orange with warm, reddish tones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque coverage with a creamier texture that was hard to apply evenly‚Äìthe color would bunch up and clump in places. The color balled up over the three and a half hours it lasted. It was lightly drying.",C+
TOO FACED,TROUBLEMAKER,Lipstick,"a bright, medium fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a semi-matte finish. This was the best-applying shade in the entire range, as the color went on evenly and didn‚Äôt drag or tug. It lasted for four and a half hours on me and left a very subtle stain behind (which is, frankly, less than the average fuchsia-hued shade, matte or not). It was non-drying.",B+
TOO FACED,MANEATER,Lipstick,"a deep, burgundy purple with cooler undertones and a satin finish. It had more slip than the other shades, and it wasn‚Äôt as thick, but it applied more noticeably uneven‚Äìthough it felt better going on and when worn‚Äìas it was splotchy, clumpy, and gathered in lip lines within an hour of wear. It lasted for five hours and left a stain behind, and it feathered slightly on me.",C-
TOO FACED,PITCH PERFECT,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark magenta purple with cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had mostly opaque coverage with a lightly creamy texture that didn‚Äôt tug on the lips. It lasted for four and a half hours on me with slight color pulling into lip lines. It was neither drying nor hydrating.",B
TOO FACED,REBEL HEART,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good color payoff with a lightly creamy texture that just barely tugged on the lips when applied directly from the tube. The color lasted for four and a half hours on me and was lightly drying.",B+
COVERGIRL,MEDIUM ROSE,Blush,"a muted, light-medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and a pearly shimmer-sheen finish.",B-
ESTEE LAUDER,PURR PINK (03),Blush,"a bright, medium pink with subtle, warm yellow undertones and a matte finish.",C+
MAC,OVERDRESSED,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúfleshy beige with pearl.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, peachy beige with warm undertones and peach pearl and shimmer. It darkens considerably when used with a damp brush‚Äìto more of a medium peach. The dupes provided are based on the dry swatch.",B+
ZOEVA,GENTLE TOUCH,Blush,"a muted, medium pink with neutral-to-cool undertones and a satin finish.",B+
ESTEE LAUDER,BRONZE GODDESS,Palette,"a highlighter, blush, and contour powder. There is little said about the formula or actual products at all, so I‚Äôm rating these as an average product of the type. The highlighter seems to be in the spirit of the brand‚Äôs Gelee formula, but the others, while similarly patterned, feel more like traditional powder products. The palette, on the whole, was disappointing and pretty dupable at that.",B-
CITY COLOR,BUBBLE BATH,Eyeshadow,"a slightly muted, light-medium peachy-beige with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had great color payoff with a cream-like, dense, and smooth consistency that adhered well to bare skin. The eyeshadow wore well for eight hours before creasing slightly.",A-
CITY COLOR,"NEW YEAR, NEW ME",Eyeshadow,"a bright, light yellowed white gold with warm undertones paired with a metallic sheen. It was richly pigmented with a creamy, dense texture that applied with opaque coverage to the lid, but it was easy to over-apply and emphasize the texture of the lid itself. This shade started to crease after eight hours on me.",A-
CITY COLOR,SPRING FLING,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark purple with subtle, warm undertones and a frosted finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a dusty, drier consistency that sheered out easily and had some fall out while applying. The color started to fade noticeably after seven hours of wear.",C
CITY COLOR,ALL EYES ON ME,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark tuape brown with warm undertones and a frosted sheen. It was intensely pigmented with a creamy, dense consistency that applied well to bare skin, but it is pretty thick and firm in the pan (not in a stiff way) that I highly recommend using a flat, synthetic brush. It blended out well, which was a surprise, since it was a thicker/denser product. On me, it wore well for eight and a half hours before creasing slightly.",A
BITE BEAUTY,COTTON CANDY,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúblue-toned violet.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, bright cotton candy pink with strong, cool blue undertones and a satin finish. It had rich color payoff with a smooth, light-medium thick consistency that covered well and evenly. This shade wore for four and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing to me.",A
BITE BEAUTY,KIMCHI,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúshocking pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a semi-matte finish. It was intensely pigmented with a very lightly creamy texture that did pull a little at the lips due a firmer feel, but it didn‚Äôt drag or yield uneven color (just takes more pressure to apply). The color wore well for six and a half hours with a strong stain left behind. I found the formula neither drying nor hydrating on this shade.",A
BITE BEAUTY,SANGRIA,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúrich fuchsia.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium-dark fuchsia pink with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It‚Äôs the type of fuchsia that almost looks ‚Äúwarm‚Äù when you compare it to the average fuchsia-hued lipstick. The texture was lightly creamy, easy to apply, and comfortable to wear, while the color coverage was fully opaque. On me, it wore for six and a half hours and was a bit moisturizing overall.",A
TOO FACED,PEANUT BUTTER & JELLY,Palette,"a travel-friendly palette. Three of them are larger, while six are smaller. The majority of the palette are warmer neutrals, though there‚Äôs that pop of violet for some color. I liked the palette, and it was actually one of the brand‚Äôs better-applying ones for me‚Äìonly one shade was really problematic. The colors are dupable, so I imagine it‚Äôs not a must-have for everyone, but it‚Äôs worth checking out if you like your warmer neutrals. The palette has a nutty, chocolaty scent that I don‚Äôt really notice on, but it is present whenever I have the palette open.",B+
NATASHA DENONA,GREEN-BROWN,Palette,"a variety of shades ranging from gold to bronze to emerald green. The majority of the eyeshadows are frosted or metallic, while a a handful are more matte. I found some of the mattes in this palette to perform better than the average matte in the brand‚Äôs formula, particularly some of the more neutral-hued shades (the more colorful mattes seemed to be the most troublesome). Even the mattes that performed better applied than anticipated were very powdery, though. The more shimmery shades are easy to use, tend to be quite pigmented, and look good on the eye, but they‚Äôre not long-wearing as promised‚Äìbetween six and eight hours, I almost always had creasing. With a primer, I was able to extend wear by two hours or so, which is still less than what I average across most powder eyeshadows.",B
URBAN DECAY,TMI,Blush,"a ‚Äúberry.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark plum with neutral-to-cool undertones and a semi-matte finish.",A-
URBAN DECAY,PARANOID,Blush,"a ‚Äúmedium bronze with gold shimmer.‚Äù It‚Äôs a slightly muted, medium-dark brown with warm undertones and a soft, pearly shimmer.",A
CHANEL,TISSE BEVERLY HILLS (262),Palette,"a new palette that was released with the spring collection. It wasn‚Äôt originally available when I purchased pieces to review from the launch, but I saw it a couple of weeks ago when they released Les Sautoirs de Coco. It‚Äôs a fairly brighter, more colorful set of hues for Chanel, and if you tend to like your colors really bold and rich, I would look elsewhere. I have had better luck with the newer Chanel quads, but this was a miss for me, and it seemed to wear and crease faster than usual, too, which was unexpected.",D+
MAC,NEW MARINE,Eyeliner,"an ‚Äúemerald green.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, bluish-teal with cool undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-sheer coverage that was buildable to mostly opaque coverage after two to three layers. The consistency glided on easily without tugging on the lash line and deposited color fairly evenly. This shade flaked away as it wore down, rather than just fading away, with noticeable flakes after seven hours of wear on the lower lash line. It lasted for four and a half hours on the waterline.",C
MAC,NIGHTCAST,Eyeliner,"a ‚Äúgrey muted plum.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark purple with neutral-to-cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in one pass, which didn‚Äôt built up much beyond that but seemed to darken and intensify slightly by layering. The color lasted for eight and a half hours on the lower lash line, five hours on the waterline.",C+
MAC,OCEAN LINER,Eyeliner,"a ‚Äúdeep blue.‚Äù It‚Äôs a dark, navy blue with cool undertones and a subtle, pearl sheen. The consistency wasn‚Äôt too waxy or too creamy, and the eyeliner glided on without tugging on the skin, even though it didn‚Äôt have great color payoff in one stroke. It was buildable to fuller coverage, but it was hard to get fully opaque coverage. It lasted for five hours on the waterline and eight hours on the lower lash line, but it started to flake after six hours of wear.",C
CHRISTIAN LOUBATIN,HAWAII KAWAI I,Palette,"a limited edition set of miniature-sized versions of the brand‚Äôs polish. For spring, the polishes are all shades that are also available in full-size in the permanent range. All three polishes were good and applied well with opaque coverage in two coats (two were nearly opaque in one coat, see below). I get about a week of wear with no chipping and minimal tip wear with Louboutin‚Äôs formula overall.",A-
MILANI,RED VINO,Blush,"a medium-dark, reddish plum with warm undertones and gold sparkle.",B-
WET 'N' WILD,DESERT EXPLORATIONS,Highlighter,"a light, pastel pink with warm undertones and a pearly shimmer. It had semi-opaque, buildable coverage with a luminous sheen that didn‚Äôt emphasize pores. The texture is slightly powdery to work with, but it didn‚Äôt look powdery when I applied it to my cheeks. It may add a hint of color on very fair skin tones. This shade wore for seven hours on me.",B+
WET 'N' WILD,SUN CEREMONY,Highlighter,"a light-medium, yellow gold with strong yellow tones (but no orange tones, so it looks almost like a ‚Äúcool‚Äù gold) and a smooth, frosted shimmer. It blended out easily and applied with semi-opaque coverage that could be diffused or built-up for lesser or greater coverage as desired. The powder is a little powdery to work with, and it just made the skin look ever-so-slightly powdery when applied. A little extra buffing helped to work the powder into the skin and leave a pearly sheen behind instead (that didn‚Äôt emphasize pores). It wore for seven hours on me.",B+
WET 'N' WILD,WHERE THE DREAMERS GO,Highlighter,"a pink-tinged white with subtle, cool undertones and a frosted sheen. This was the most shimmery/metallic of the three. It had medium coverage that was buildable to opaque payoff if desired, but the lightly powdery, smooth texture made it easy to diffuse and blend on the skin. The shimmer didn‚Äôt emphasize pores either, which is always nice. This shade lasted for seven hours before fading.",B+
ANASTASIA,TEAL SHIMMER,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium blue with cool undertones and a satin sheen. It had semi-sheer pigmentation with a dry consistency that was a little loose in the pan and hard to apply to the skin. I had trouble blending it out and keeping it even, as it had a tendency to stick more to certain places. It lasted for six hours on me.",D
ANASTASIA,DRAGONFLY,Eyeshadow,"a muted, blackened blue with cool undertones and a frosted sheen. It had semi-opaque coverage with a dry, dusty texture that was hard to blend out evenly. The color lasted for seven hours before fading.",C
ANASTASIA,FRESH GREEN,Eyeshadow,"a bright, light-medium grass green with warm, yellow undertones and a satin shimmer. It had semi-sheer color payoff with a powdery consistency that was prone to sheering out. I was only able to get six hours of wear out of this shade.",F
ANASTASIA,OPALINE,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark purple with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had good pigmentation paired with a soft, blendable texture that was just a little powdery to work with. This shade wore well for seven and a half hours before fading.",B+
ANASTASIA,STAR BLUE,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark bluish-purple with a satin shimmer. It had semi-opaque color payoff with a dusty consistency that gave it a much more faded look than it appeared in the pan. This shade faded noticeably after six hours of wear.",C-
MAC,EYE Z YOU,Palette,"a pink and plum-hued palette with a subdued gray in the mix. There are six shades, and two appear to be totally new-to-me, while three are repromotes from past releases (two are from larger permanent palettes) and one is permanent as a single (Phloof!). It‚Äôs decent, and I was able to use all six shades on their own with some success, but some of the shades are drier to work with.",B
MAC,SHEER MADNESS,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúsheer nude [with a Lustre finish]. It‚Äôs a very light champagne beige with fine champagne and iridescent pink pearl. It seemed to add a little warmth but mostly shimmer when applied to lips. It is sheer, as you might expect a Lustre to me, so this is a shade that can look quite different from person to person. It had a light amount of slip so it didn‚Äôt tug, but the color seemed to gather and emphasize lip lines. It was gone after an hour of wear‚Äìat least it was drying (though it wasn‚Äôt moisturizing either).",C-
MAC,DARLING CLEMENTINE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright orange [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium orange with warm, orange-red undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had intense color payoff with a smooth, velvety consistency that glided across the lips without tugging. The consistency was a little clingy after an hour or so. On me, it lasted for five and a half hours and was lightly drying.",A-
MAC,DANGEROUSLY RED,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúblue fuchsia [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, bright, medium-dark fuchsia red with cool, blue undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had opaque color payoff with a creamy, smooth consistency that applied evenly and easily. This shade lasted for six hours, left behind a stain, and was neither drying nor hydrating over time.",A
ANASTASIA,ASH BROWN,Eyeshadow,"a muted, dark taupe-brown with warm, yellow undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had a powdery, drier consistency that made it prone to sheering out. It was harder to apply to bare skin (definitely recommend a primer!) and lasted for seven hours on its own.",C
ANASTASIA,POSE,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark plum with warm, brown undertones and a frosted finish. It had fairly good color payoff with a soft, blendable texture that was just a smidgen dusty. This shade wore well for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
ANASTASIA,ROSE,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium, rosy copper with warm undertones and a frosted sheen. It had good pigmentation with a denser, lightly creamy consistency that blended out easily and still retained its intensity on the lid. This shade lasted for eight hours on me.",A-
ANASTASIA,VICTORIAN,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark pewter with warm undertones and a frosted sheen. It had good color payoff with a slightly dry, dusty consistency that tended to kick up excess product. It sheered out slightly applied to the skin, but it didn‚Äôt lose too much of its coloring‚Äìit would benefit from a primer. The color faded noticeably after seven hours of wear.",B-
ANASTASIA,PENNY,Eyeshadow,"a medium, golden copper with warm, orange undertones and a frosted finish. It had good color payoff with a lightly dusty texture that was blendable but a little messy to use. This shade started to fade after seven and a half hours of wear.",B+
GIORGIO ARMANI,#501 UPTOWN,Lipgloss,"a medium, pink-coral with warm undertones and a creamy, lightly glossy finish. It darkens quite a bit on lips and appears pinker as well. It had semi-opaque coverage which went on evenly, and it was somewhat buildable (it‚Äôs supposed to be buildable). The color wore for six hours and left behind a strong stain.",A
GIORGIO ARMANI,#601 PLUM VINYL,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark plum with subtle, cooler undertones and a lightly shiny finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage in one layer and could be built up to mostly opaque coverage (but always with some translucency) with two to three layers. The consistency spread across the lips well and left even color that didn‚Äôt gather into lip lines (not an easy feat for deeper shades like this). The color wore for almost eight hours with the shine fading after five hours.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,EXPOSED,Lipgloss,"a slightly muted, medium-dark reddish-berry with subtle, cool undertones and a creamy, high-shine finish. The color payoff was mostly opaque with a translucency to it that gave it that stain-like appearance. The consistency was lightweight, comfortable to wear, but it does have moderate tackiness. This shade was still going strong after eight hours (glossiness lasted about six hours) and was hydrating over time.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,NO VACANCY,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium red with warm, orange tones and a creamy, glossy finish. It had rich, nearly opaque pigmentation with even, smooth application that lasted all day. The shine was going strong for five to six hours, but the color remained just as vibrant with more of a natural sheen for hours after.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,EROTIC,Lipgloss,"a medium, fuchsia red with cool, blue undertones and a glossy finish. It had good color coverage with light translucency that you would see with a lip stain. The color goes on easily and evenly and sits well on the lips. The color was still going strong after ten hours of wear, though the glossiness lasted for around six hours. The formula was comfortable to wear and moisturizing over time.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,INFAMY,Lipgloss,"vibrant, medium-rask fuchsia pink with cool undertones and a high-shine, glossy finish and very subtle fuchsia micro-shimmer. It had very nearly opaque coverage that applied evenly and smoothly, but there was a slight translucency that gave it the appearance of a lip stain. The shine wore long at six hours, while the color itself lasted well for ten hours (when I removed it) ‚Äî and it was still quite apparent and rich at that point with a more natural sheen than a high-gloss finish. It was hydrating while worn.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,LILAC DREAM,Palette,"a set of cooler-toned shades that range from pink to purple. Two of the four shades didn‚Äôt do so well, and the other two had minor issues (none were perfect, unfortunately). I think this quad in particular really is incapable of being used with decent results without a good primer (and adhesive base, if you want to use the glittery shade), whereas most of Tom Ford‚Äôs quads I think can be used without a primer (of course, a good primer will always improve your results!).",C+
CHANEL,PINCTADA (214),Lipgloss,"a medium, fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a fine dusting of lighter pink shimmer. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque color coverage, while the Glossimer formula is one of those that has pigmentation from sheer to opaque (hard to know what was intended, unfortunately, on a shade-by-shade basis). The texture was lightweight and comfortable to wear, though it did not apply as evenly as one would want. It wore well for four and a half hours.",B+
CHANEL,BABIOLE (215),Lipgloss,"a bright, medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a cream finish. It was semi-opaque and similar to Pinctada, just without shimmer and slightly darker. It applied a little more evenly, but it could still use some improvement. The texture was lightweight, comfortable to wear, while the color lasted for four and a half hours.",A-
CHANEL,CLARTE (216),Lipgloss,"light, iridescent beige with cool-toned shimmer and a neutral-to-warm-toned base color. It had semi-sheer coverage with a fair amount of shimmer; this gloss is more shimmer than color, but it may lighten the natural lip color somewhat. It went on easily and lasted for four hours.",A-
SEPHORA,SHAME ON YOU (01),Blush,"an ‚Äúold rose.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a matte finish.",B+
ANASTASIA,GLEAM,Palette,"four highlighters that range from a light champagne to a darker copper. Each shade is 0.26 oz. and can be removed from the palette, if desired, but they are currently only sold together (not sure if they will eventually be available as pans only). Presently, it is exclusive to Macy‚Äôs and the brand‚Äôs website. According to Anastasia, these are supposed to be ‚Äúmetallic powder highlighters for intense luminosity‚Äù that can also be worn on the eyes. They are softer and silkier with a more finely-milled consistency compared to the Illuminators released a couple of months ago. These also have a finer shimmer and overall sheen that is less emphasizing of pores on the skin.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,HONEYMOON,Palette,"a warm-toned set of shades with a more frosted/metallic finish. All four shades performed well, had good pigmentation, blended out nicely, and lasted for eight to nine hours on me (without primer). The formula can be used wet or dry, with damp application yielding a slightly darker, smoother, and richer color overall that was sometimes more metallic. Tom Ford‚Äôs wet/dry formula doesn‚Äôt have a lot said about it, only that it can be applied dry for a ‚Äúsleek and soft finish‚Äù or ‚Äúwet for a bold and chromatic finish.‚Äù It performs well, and it‚Äôs easy to use, but the shades are very dupable, so if you‚Äôre looking for something unique to justify the price tag, I don‚Äôt think this it. If you‚Äôre focused on quality and like this combination of shades, it‚Äôs certainly worth a look.",A
KAT VON D,HANSEL + GRETEL,Palette,"a new, permanent set of copper and peach. The blush formula is supposed to ‚Äústay vibrant for a full 24 hours of wear‚Äù with ‚Äúsilky powders‚Äù that ‚Äúblend effortlessly into skin for a flawless, buildable finish.‚Äù The marketing makes it unclear what level of pigmentation these should be on Sephora, but per the brand‚Äôs Instagram, they are ‚Äúhighly pigmented.‚Äù As you might have guessed from the last three reviews, results were not impressive. The darker shade was sheer and difficult to blend on the skin, while the lighter shade was less firm in the pan and more powdery, so it was easier to blend but was still sheer. Neither shade made it in the realm of 24 hour wear. The two mixed together (just swirled with a brush) is better than either alone, but blending was still a pain and required an excessive amount of layers for it to show up for photos on my skin tone.",F
SURRATT BEAUTY,GLAMOUR EYES,Palette,"a two-part compact that twists to reveal a glittery, more powder-like eyeshadow on the lower level, and then on the upper level, the lid twists off and reveals a cream eyeshadow. The brand states that the cream eyeshadow is a long-wearing, ‚Äúwater-proof shadow base‚Äù that can be used underneath the glittery eyeshadow or as an eyeliner. The glittery eyeshadow is called a ‚Äúprismatic top coat.‚Äù The two only work well when used together, but neither works that well alone. Together, they‚Äôre pretty, but the cream eyeshadow is fussier than ideal for a cream-based product, so blending and getting even coverage were quite challenging.",C+

MAC,SUNNY SURPRISE,Highlighter,"Äúsoft peach.‚Äù It‚Äôs a soft, light-medium peach with warm, orange undertones and a satin finish.",B-
MAC,HAVE YOUR CAKE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright magenta [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a slightly muted, medium-dark magenta purple with cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good pigmentation with a velvety, creamy consistency that applied easily on the lips. This shade wore for six hours and left a strong stain behind, but it was slightly drying after four hours of wear.",A
MAC,LONG LEGGED & FABULOUS,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúsoft baby pink [with a Cremesheen + Pearl finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium pink with subtle cool undertones and a natural shine. It looked warm-toned in the tube, but it lightened and looked cool-toned when applied. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a lightly emollient texture that was comfortable to wear but could have applied more evenly. This shade wore for three and a half hours but settled slightly into lip lines. It wasn‚Äôt drying, but it wasn‚Äôt hydrating either.",B-
MAC,PLEASE ME,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúmuted rosy-tinted pink [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, slightly muted rosy pink with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It‚Äôs part of MAC‚Äôs permanent range. The texture is velvety and fairly smooth, so it goes on without tugging on the lips. It is a little thicker, so it seemed to emphasize the natural texture of my lips to a minor degree. It wore well for four and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
MAC,LIFE'S A PICNIC,Blush,"a ‚Äúhot reddish pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, bright medium coral-pink with very subtle undertones and a satin finish. It was intensely pigmented with a really soft, smooth consistency that blended out easily on the skin and had a natural finish that didn‚Äôt emphasize pores but didn‚Äôt look too flat or powdery either. I actually found it looked linker and less coral the more I blended it out‚ÄìI can see this one‚Äôs tone changing from person to person a little more than your average blush shade. It lasted for eight and a half hours before fading.",A
MAC,OH MY!,Blush,"a ‚Äúreddish mid-tone coral.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium coral-red with warm undertones and slight hints of pink paired with a semi-matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation (and buildable for sure) with a fairly soft and blendable texture. It wasn‚Äôt quite as easily blended and diffused as Life‚Äôs a Picnic, and when blended down, they both look very similar on me but those with cooler undertones will likely see more warmth out of Oh My!. It wore well for eight and a half hours before fading was apparent.",B+
MAC,THE FASHION FLOCK,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright pink-coral [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, pink-coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. It‚Äôs the more updated, velvety-smooth matte formula that glides on without tugging on the lips but has some shine to the end result for the first hour or so of wear. It was very pigmented, but the thicker consistency made it harder to apply without the thicker consistency gathering and emphasizing lip lines. The color lasted for four and a half to five hours, but there was noticeable settling into lip lines over time. It was neither drying nor hydrating when I wore it. This shade is exclusive to maccosmetics.com.",B+
MAC,FLOCKING FABULOUS,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright coral-red [with a Cremesheen + Pearl finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a brighter, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and very fine gold pearl. It had mostly opaque coverage with a lightly creamy consistency that felt wet almost when applied but didn‚Äôt slide around the lips much (there were a few ‚Äúlines‚Äù that were very slightly noticeable if I pressed my lips together, but the color/brightness seem to camouflage them a lot). The color lasted for four and a half hours and was neither hydrating nor drying.",A-
MAC,NICE TO MEET YOU,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep pink-red [with a Cremesheen finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium pinky-red with cool undertones and a luminous sheen. It had mostly opaque coverage, though there‚Äôs translucency across the shade so the natural lip color can come through enough to influence the tone, brightness, or color of the end result somewhat if you have stronger natural lip color. The texture was lightweight, comfortable to wear, and lightly emollient without being too slippery. This shade lasted for four and a half hours on me and was neither hydrating nor drying.",A-
CLE DE PEAU,PEWTER VEIL (311),Palette,"a set of cooler-toned shades in hues of blue-teal, dark gray, pewter, and bright silver. Not particularly enamored with this quad, as each shade has some sort of issue, and at this price point, it becomes hard to justify or excuse the downsides.",B-
BITE BEAUTY,PASTILLE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark rosy mauve with neutral undertones and a semi-matte finish. It was one of the more matte shades in the six for spring shades. It had mostly opaque color payoff with a lightly velvety consistency that applied evenly and didn‚Äôt tug on the lips during application. The color wore well for four and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,RED VELVET,Lipstick,"a deepened red with neutral-to-cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It was nearly opaque applied, but you can see a hint of lip freckle peaking through. The texture was creamy and smooth, and it applied with ease. This shade lasted for over six hours and left a stain behind. The formula was slightly hydrating overall.",A
BITE BEAUTY,ROSEHIP,Lipstick,"a bright, medium red with warm undertones and a satin finish. It was nicely pigmented with a really velvety, smooth consistency that glided across the lips easily and yielded even coverage. This shade stayed on well for six hours and was lightly hydrating.",A
ANASTASIA,PLUM SMOKE,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark rosy taupe with mauve tones and a subtle, bronze sheen. It‚Äôs a rather complicated color, because I can see the ‚Äúplum‚Äù in a sense yet wouldn‚Äôt think to describe it in the plum family. It had good pigmentation with a soft, blendable texture that ran a little powdery. The color started to fade after seven and a half hours.",B+
ANASTASIA,MACAROON,Eyeshadow,"light-medium, pinky lavender with subtle, warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It was intensely pigmented with a dense, buttery texture that went on smoothly and blended out nicely. This shade wore well for eight hours on me.",A
ANASTASIA,NOT TODAY,Eyeshadow,"medium-dark plum with warm, brown undertones and silver sparkle over a pearly sheen. The consistency is denser and more cream-like, which helps a lot of the sparkles to bind with the color and not just rest on the surface. This resulted in a lot less fall out during application and wear, though there were a few stray sparkles by the end of the day that had fallen underneath the eye. It had great pigmentation, blended out well, and wore without creasing for eight hours.",A-
ANASTASIA,AUBERGINE,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark plum with warm, reddish-brown undertones and a sprinkling of plum and purple sparkle over a semi-matte finish. It had good pigmentation with a soft, blendable texture that wasn‚Äôt too firm or too soft, so it didn‚Äôt kick up excess product was still easy to use. This shade wore well for eight hours on me.",A-
ANASTASIA,FUDGE,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, rich brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. It was intensely pigmented with a really smooth, silky consistency that was denser than the average matte eyeshadow from the brand. It blended out beautifully on the lid without losing its intensity or depth. On me, this shade lasted for eight and a half hours before fading noticeably.",A
ANASTASIA,HENNA,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium-dark copper with warm undertones and a metallic finish. It was incredibly dense and pigmented, which made it a little harder to get on a fluffier eyeshadow brush (you may want to use something flatter or firmer, possibly a synthetic brush). The texture was cream-like and buttery, and the color adhered exceptionally well to bare skin. It lasted for almost ten hours on me.",A
ANASTASIA,INTENSE GAZE,Eyeshadow,"a slightly muted, medium-dark reddish-copper with warm undertones and a frosted sheen. The texture was soft, blendable, but it was a little dusty and thin, so I found the wear to be shorter at seven and a half hours. It had good pigmentation, though!",B+
ANASTASIA,PARTY DRESS,Eyeshadow,"a soft, light-medium peachy brown with warm undertones and fine gold sparkle over a satin finish. The sparkle got everywhere, and the sparkly bits didn‚Äôt bind with the base at all. It had decent pigmentation otherwise, and it blended out well, but it was just fall out city! After I cleaned up the initial fall out from application, there was little sparkle left and the eyeshadow lasted for seven hours.",C+
DIOR,BLUE GARDEN (031),Palette,"a mix of white, silver, gray, blue, and orange. The orange is an interesting addition (certainly makes it more unique), but whether that‚Äôs a good addition or not is quite subjective. I couldn‚Äôt find anything online that described this as a wet/dry formula, but it felt like that to me, so I did swatch it both dry (left) and damp (right) for your viewing pleasure. The ratings are based solely on performance dry, though, which was disappointing across the board.",C
NARS,IMPASSIONED,Blush,"a ‚Äúrich orchid.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, light-medium rosy pink with neutral-to-warm undertones and a matte finish.",B-
NARS,CRESSIDA,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúshimmering midnight blue.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium-dark blue with a frosted finish. It is more muted and semi-opaque when applied dry, and it wore for seven and a half hours on me. When I applied it damp, the color was fully opaque and brighter, while longevity came in at eight and a half hours. The texture was a little drier and harder to blend out dry, and it was somewhat easier when applied damp, but it tended to dry unevenly.",B
NARS,KARI,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúsoft rose pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium rosy pink with neutral-to-warm undertones and a pearly shimmer-sheen. The powder had a soft, smooth consistency to the touch, and it was less dry compared to other shades in the range (I think it‚Äôs the lack of shimmer, relative to the other shades). It applied with lighter, semi-sheer coverage that wore for seven hours used dry, and it was fully opaque and wore for eight hours when applied damp.",A-
NARS,TARVOS,Eyeshadow,"an ‚Äúicy mint.‚Äù It‚Äôs a subtly cool-toned, mint green with a frosted, slightly metallic finish. Applied dry, it was semi-sheer and appeared warmer-tone, while applied damp yielded nearly opaque coverage and a more metallic and cooler-toned sheen. The texture was soft, blendable, and smooth, though a little dry to the touch. It wore well for eight hours when applied damp but only six and a half hours when applied dry.",B+
NARS,"L'AMOUR, TOUJOURS L'AMOUR",Palette,"a new, limited edition eyeshadow palette that features twelve eyeshadows; four are over-sized and eight are more normally sized. What‚Äôs interesting to me is that I can‚Äôt find a single call out from the bran that the formula is any different than their typical powder eyeshadow, and I think that with the exception of mattes, they‚Äôre quite different. They have a much denser and creamier consistency‚Äìyou can feel the silicone in it‚Äìthat makes it comparable to newer formulas like Make Up For Ever Artist Shadows, MAC Colour Drenched Pigments, and Kat Von D Metal Crush Eyeshadows (to name a few). I personally find that NARS‚Äô standard eyeshadow formula to be one of the weaker high-end formulations, though there are some that are great. This palette, overall, is significantly more pigmented, easier to work with, and more blendable than the majority of NARS eyeshadows I have tried to-date. I think the weakest point is that these creased on me at the seven-hour mark, so they definitely require a primer based on my testing for longevity.",B
DIOR,GLOWING NUDE (002),Highlighter,"a light-medium gold with warm, peach-brown tones and a luminous, slightly frosted sheen.",A-
DIOR,GLOWING PINK (001),Highlighter,"a cool-toned, pinkish-white with a luminous sheen.",A-
COLOUR POP,SANTOS,Blush,"a ‚Äúsoft golden bronze.‚Äù It‚Äôs a slightly muted, medium-dark bronzy brown with warm, rosy undertones and a pearly sheen. There‚Äôs a plum/rosy vibe I get from it that makes it appear less bronzy, especially as I blended it out (even against my warmer undertones). The texture was smooth, soft, and blendable without being too dry or too emollient. It had buildable color coverage from semi-sheer to opaque, depending on how you applied it (which is how it is described). This shade wore well for ten hours before fading.",A+
COLOUR POP,NEW LOWES,Blush,"a ‚Äúcool-toned berry.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark berry with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had buildable coverage from semi-sheer to mostly opaque with a natural finish that wasn‚Äôt shimmery but not totally matte. The more this is blended out (and sheered out), the more it appears as a stain. The texture was smooth, thin, and a little drier compared to the more shimmery shades in the cheek color range. It was fairly blendable, but it wasn‚Äôt quite as effortless as Santos. It wore well for ten hours before starting to fade.",A
BITE BEAUTY,CONFECTION/MARMALADE,Palette,"a bright, pop of fuchsia pink paired with a warmer, medium orange. It‚Äôs another good set of shades that performs well and lives up to its claims! Bite‚Äôs Luminous Creme formula is very consistent for me, so I‚Äôm happy to see it is equally consistent in their mini duos.",A
COLOUR POP,PUPPY LOVE,Eyeshadow,a ‚Äúsoft peach with pink and gold duochrome.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light peach with warm undertones and an iridescent pink sheen. It read more pink sheen than duochrome to me (I couldn‚Äôt detect as much of a shift when moving my arm).,B+
MAC,FASHION LEGACY,Lipstick,"an ‚Äúintense fire truck tred.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium-dark orange-toned red with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had rich pigmentation with a smooth consistency that delivered even coverage. It was easy to apply and dried down in about a minute or less. The color wore well for seven and a half hours, but the formula was moderately drying after four hours of wear.",A
MAC,MADEMOISELLE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright creamy coral.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, yellowed peach with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque pigmentation, though it had some visible streakiness at some angles (sometimes they were hardly noticeable). There was slight ‚Äúcracking‚Äô when I smiled, where you can see the color pulling away. This shade lasted for five hours before it had faded unevenly enough to require removal or reapplication. It was one of the more unique shades (to me) within this range, due to the yellower tones.",C+
MAC,TO MATTE WITH LOVE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright raspberry.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, warm fuchsia pink with a matte finish. It was richly pigmented, and the color applied with really smooth, even coverage as well. While it was drying, it did wear for almost eight hours.",A
MAC,RECOLLECTION,Lipstick,"an ‚Äúintense bright violet.‚Äù It‚Äôs a slightly brightened, medium-dark violet purple with subtle, cool fuchsia undertones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage with a smooth, matte finish. It applied evenly for the most part, but there were a few areas that seemed to have less coverage than others; I didn‚Äôt think it was noticeable from a normal viewing distance, just up-close. The color wore well for six and a half hours but was moderately drying after four hours.",B+
MAC,TAILORED TO TEASE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright fuchsia.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, fuchsia plum with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation that applied smoothly, but there was a dryness present to the end result that flaked off a little as powdery bits over time. The color wore well for six and a half hours, which was shorter than I‚Äôd expect for a deeper shade like this. The formula was, like other shades, drying for me.",B
MAC,HIGH DRAMA,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep dark plum.‚Äù It‚Äôs a blackened plum with cool undertones and a matte finish. While a lot of the darker shades actually out-performed light and medium shades, this one was more of a miss. It needs at least two coats, if not a lip liner underneath just to manage some of the unevenness/streakiness present in the shade itself. It had semi-opaque coverage and a longer dry down time (two minutes). On me, it wore for seven hours and was moderately drying after four hours of wear.",C
MAC,OH LADY,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep wine.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark berry with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff where the natural lip still peeks through (and will ultimately influence the color and tone of it if you have stronger color in your natural lips). The texture was a little thinner and runnier compared to other shades in the range. This shade wore for seven and a half hours and was moderately drying after five hours.",A-
MAC,SNUGGLE UP,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúbright pinky lilac.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, fuchsia-tinted purple with subtle, warm cool undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque pigmentation with a smooth consistency. Applied, it was uneven and streaky. I didn‚Äôt notice the gloss in lip lines too much, but it did become more noticeable as the day went on. This shade lasted for four and a half hours on me.",B-
MAC,MARVEL-LUSH,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúbubblegum pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, cool-toned pink with a creamy, milky finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff with a creamy texture that was comfortable to wear over a four hour period, but the application is streaky and uneven. Some of the color emphasized and pulled into lip lines over time as well.",B
MAC,LOVE BUZZ,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúfuchsia pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a slightly muted, medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a creamy finish. This one seemed like the shiniest of the set! Unfortunately, it applied streakily, so it didn‚Äôt look the best on. It had semi-opaque pigmentation and was comfortable to wear, at least. On me, the color wore for five hours.",B+
TOO FACED,METALLIC CHOCOLATE DIAMONDS,Lipstick,"a light-medium taupe brown with silver glitter. It is chunkier glitter compared to the other two shades, as well as when compared against the Metals in general. I was surprised that the texture wasn‚Äôt grittier, but it was fairly smooth until the gloss wore away. It applied fairly evenly, lasted for two and a half hour (though glitter stuck around for longer), and was lightly hydrating. It‚Äôs nowhere near as pigmented as described or as most of the previously released Metals have been.",C-
TOO FACED,METALLIC CHOCOLATE CANDY BAR,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark coppery brown with warm, yellow undertones and fine yellow gold shimmer. It had semi-sheer color payoff with a glossy sheen. The texture was lightweight, smooth, and comfortable to wear (I couldn‚Äôt feel the shimmer), but the wear time was a mere three hours. It was lightly hydrating, though!",C+
TOO FACED,METALLIC FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE,Lipstick,"subdued, medium-dark rosyb rown with warm, reddish undertones and fine gold pearl. It had semi-opaque color payoff‚Äìit was the most pigmented of the three‚Äìthat covered well and wore for four hours overall. The formula was moisturizing and comfortable to wear.",B+
MAC,OH HONEY,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúwarm chocolate.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium, peachy brown with warm undertones and a satin-matte finish. It had fairly good color payoff, though not fully opaque, with a lightly creamy texture that was thin but applied evenly. The color lasted for four hours and faded slightly unevenly, and it was, unfortunately, slightly drying as well.",B
MAC,PROMISE ME,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúsoft beige nude.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, rosy beige with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. The texture was thin and velvety, so it didn‚Äôt tug, but it emphasized every imperfection on the lips. It had a dry look to applied, even though it didn‚Äôt feel particularly dry or clingy. It settled into lip lines and faded unevenly, while total wear was only three hours.",C-
MAC,REDDY TO GO,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep brick red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a deep, slightly muted red with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good color payoff, though not fully opaque, paired with a lightly velvety, smooth texture that glided on without issue. The color wore well for almost six hours, and it was just a bit drying after four hours of wear.",A-
TOO FACED,LOVE FLUSH,Palette,"six, miniature-sized blushes‚Äìall six that exist in the Love Flush range. The palette contains $52 worth of blush, and it is a nice way to try six for less than the price of two full-sized ones. I love the concept, and I think the quality is on-par with or better than the permanent, individual pans that came out. The big takeaway is that I think the formula is better than it rates, as it primarily gets dinged for not lasting the 16-hours promised (wear is between eight and ten hours), so if getting half the stated wear-time isn‚Äôt a deal-breaker, the formula is well-worth a look, whether an individual shade or the palette. The shades were extremely consistent with the individual compacts I tested previously; I specifically tested the shades in the palette for quality and wear, but for the photos of the blushes on my face, those were taken from original reviews.",B
OCC,MOSH,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbrick burgundy metallic.‚Äù It‚Äôs a deep, reddish burgundy with fine copper/gold shimmer and a natural sheen. It was richly pigmented with a light-medium weight consistency that had some slip, which I found caused feathering after four hours of wear (though the color itself was still going strong after six hours). I was impressed at how even it applied, as darker shades (especially when liquid or slippery) tend to apply poorly. It was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
OCC,STUD,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúgreyed aubergine matte.‚Äù It‚Äôs a dark, muted purple with a cream finish. It had opaque color coverage with a light-medium-weight consistency‚Äìit was one of the thicker shades on the collection‚Äìthat applied smoothly and evenly. The color was still going strong after six hours of wear, and the formula was a little drying after seven hours of wear.",A
MAC,CHEEK POLLEN,Blush,"a ‚Äúwarm nude [with a Satin finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark brown with warm undertones and a satin shimmer-sheen finish. It was richly pigmented with a really soft, smooth, almost buttery consistency that applied well to the skin. It blended out beautifully, while the satin finish gave the skin luminosity without emphasizing pores. On me, it lasted for eight hours.",A
MAC,SPELLBINDER,Blush,"a ‚Äúpastel yellow pink [with a Satin finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a slightly softened, light-medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a satin sheen. It had good color payoff and a soft, smooth texture that blended out easily on the skin. The sheen becomes more pronounced the more it is buffed into the skin. This shade wore well for eight hours on me before fading.",A-
NYX,NARCISSISTIC,Highlighter,"a light, golden peach with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It had a soft, lightly powdery consistency that was blendable and didn‚Äôt read dry or powdery on the skin. The powder imparted a soft but noticeable glow to the skin without adding a lot of color on my skin tone (but fairer complexions may see more warmth). It wore well for seven hours on me.",B+
NYX,CHAOTIC,Highlighter,"a light-medium pink with warm undertones and a golden shimmer and sparkle. The texture was looser‚Äìnoticeably drier‚Äìand a little powdery to work with. The shimmer was stronger in this shade than in Narcissistic as well. It worked more as a highlighting blush on my skin tone, and it may be more or less a blush or highlighter depending on your own skin tone. It just barely emphasized pores on my cheeks. The highlighter started to fade after seven hours of wear.",B-
BUXOM,PINK COQUETTE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúsatin bright warm pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, yellow-toned pink with a creamy, glossy finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff with a creamy, emollient texture that had a moderate amount of slip. The formula was moisturizing and comfortable to wear, but it only lasted for four hours with minor settling into lip lines.",B+
BUXOM,ULTRAVIOLET,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúmatte bright violet.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium-dark magenta purple with cool undertones and a flat, matte finish. This was the most matte shade that I tried from the six I bought. It had good pigmentation with a velvety-smooth texture that didn‚Äôt drag or tug on the lips, but it does cling slightly. On me, the color wore well for six hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
BUXOM,VOODOO SPICE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúmatte deep blue red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a deep, burgundy red with subtle, cooler pink tones and a semi-matte finish. It had good color coverage (almost opaque but not quite!) that applied evenly and smoothly without tugging on the lips. On me, it wore for a solid six hours and was very slightly hydrating.",A-
GIORGIO ARMANI,#402 RED TO GO,Lipgloss,"a bold, bright orange-red with warm undertones and a creamy, high-shine finish.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,MISBEHAVED (49),Lipstick,"a medium, orange-coral with warm undertones and a soft shine‚Äìa little more than a satin but not glossy. The texture was smooth, creamy, and easy to apply as it glided on without tugging and deposited nearly opaque coverage evenly. On me, this shade stayed on well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,SO VAIN (50),Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark rosy plum with warm undertones and very fine gold shimmer. It had a nice, creamy texture that was easy to use and comfortable to wear, while it also distributed the color evenly. This shade had mostly opaque color payoff and lasted for four and a half hours on me. It was moderately moisturizing as well.",A
GIORGIO ARMANI,#400 FOUR HUNDRED,Lipgloss,"a medium-dark red with cool, blue undertones and a cream finish.",A-
TOO FACED,LA PETITE MAISON,Palette,"twelve eyeshadows in mostly neutral shades, but there is a pop of lavender and purple. It‚Äôs exclusive to Ulta, and of course, limited edition. I think it‚Äôs one of the better offerings from Too Faced this year, but it‚Äôs not my favorite that they‚Äôve done.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,BARE PEACH (23),Lipstick,"a light-medium, peachy coral with warm, orange undertones and very fine pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, but it was definitely thinner and more translucent compared to a lot of the permanent range (typically shades without shimmer). The texture was thin but not gritty (I couldn‚Äôt feel the shimmer) and applied evenly. It lasted for four hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,SOMETHING WILD (46),Lipstick,"a brightened, medium-dark pink-coral with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had mostly opaque pigmentation with a nicely creamy consistency that glided onto the lips easily and delivered smooth, even coverage. The color wore well for five hours and was moderately hydrating.",A
NYX,SUMMER,Blush,"medium, pink-coral with warm undertones and gold pearl.",A-
NYX,TUSCAN,Blush,"a bold, bright coral-red with warm undertones and a satin finish.",B+
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,HOLIDAY 2015,Palette,"seven, travel-sized eyeliners; two shades are limited edition and exclusive to the set, while five are from the permanent range. I don‚Äôt see it on Sephora currently, but it is still available through Marc Jacobs directly. I was really disappointed by the set, because every single eyeliner was dry as a bone when swatched to the point where just trying to swatch it resulted in all but one of the eyeliner‚Äôs tips breaking off. After the tip broke, the eyeliners were soft and creamy, which is why it‚Äôs so frustrating that the exterior coating to the pencil is so bad that it completely impedes the product‚Äôs performance. The one eyeliner that didn‚Äôt break still remains firmer and harder to use after three uses. This makes it harder to rate, because unless you break off the tip, they‚Äôre difficult and poor-performing, but since by the nature of just how firm they were, they inevitably broke (without me trying at all; in fact, I was trying NOT to!) and were much better. I‚Äôve found that the full-sized, permanent formula has similar issues where some shades are creamy and easy-to-apply from the get-go and others are drier, firmer (and some have never gotten better for me). This inconsistency is the worst part about an otherwise impressive formula that wears nine to ten hours and comes in an assortment of more unique shades (some are more typical shades, of course). I didn‚Äôt have such significant texture issues with last year‚Äôs set. That being said, you will find the scores reflecting that these are not of the same quality as others I have tried (primarily in the overall quality and texture scores).",B-
TOO FACED,LE GRAND CHATEAU,Palette,"three palettes, plus a travel-sized Better Than Sex Mascara. Each palette contains six eyeshadows and a face product (either a blush or bronzer). It‚Äôs a decent set with some hits and misses, and in general, there was just a dustiness/powderiness to some shades that resulted in either slightly sheerer color payoff or shorter wear time (things that a decent primer should fix quite well).",B
COLOUR POP,EXIT,Eyeliner,"a ‚Äútrue bright white.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright white with neutral-to-cool undertones and a matte finish. It was mostly opaque in a single stroke, and it was buildable to totally opaque coverage. The texture was creamy and glided on without tugging on the lash line. It lasted for nine hours on me.",A
COLOUR POP,PUNCH,Eyeliner,"a ‚Äúbrilliant canary yellow.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, sunshine yellow with a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single pass (which is impressive for any liner, especially a yellow one!). The texture of the pencil was soft, smooth, and creamy, which helped it apply smoothly and evenly on the lash line. The color wore well for eight and a half hours before thinning.",A
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,MIDNIGHT SEDUCTION + SAPPHIRE,Palette,"a navy blue-themed duo, featuring a powder eyeshadow and pencil eyeliner. The eyeshadow is nice, but the eyeliner was a miss.",B-
STILA,SENDING MY LOVE,Palette,"three cheek colors, five eyeshadows, an eyeliner, and a lipgloss. I was pleasantly surprised by this set! It‚Äôs not particularly unique, but it‚Äôs well-done and high quality.",A-
COLOUR POP,BOOGIE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúvibrant violet red with turquoise glitter.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, berry purple with cool, blue undertones and subtle sparkle over a semi-matte finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff that applied evenly. The texture had a slight grit to it from the sparkle, but it didn‚Äôt drag when applied. It lasted for over six hours, but it was somewhat drying.",B+
COLOUR POP,PEPPERMINT,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúwarm peachy nude.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, peachy orange with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied evenly with a lightly creamy consistency that didn‚Äôt drag and was comfortable to wear. The color lasted for four and a half hours, and the formula was neither drying nor hydrating while worn.",A
COLOUR POP,SILK,Lipstick,"q ‚Äúrich deepened burgundy.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, muted red with a hint of cooler, pink tones and a semi-matte finish. It reminded me of a poinsettia. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, but it didn‚Äôt entirely cover my lip freckle, so some of the natural lip color will come through (mine is lighter, so it doesn‚Äôt alter the lipstick color much, if at all). It had a lightly creamy texture that applied without tugging. The color was still going strong after six hours of wear, but it was mildly drying.",A-
COLOUR POP,FAMOUS,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúsoft subtle gold.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, yellowed gold with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had good pigmentation with a smooth, creamy texture that felt almost wet to the touch, but it still had the mousse-like consistency you‚Äôd expect from ColourPop‚Äôs eyeshadow formula. It applied well with true-to-pot color and coverage, and the eyeshadow looked as good ten hours later as it did when I applied it.",A
COLOUR POP,CHEAP DATE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äútrue gold ‚Ä¶ with silver sparkles.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, yellow gold with warm, brown undertones and silver sparkle over a metallic finish. It was intensely pigmented with a creamy, smooth texture that was easy to blend out. It has a little more texture to it, so it could have gone on a little more smoothly on the lid with a brush (with a fingertip, it was fine). The color showed no signs of fading or creasing after ten hours of wear.",A
COLOUR POP,DGAF,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúmedium-toned rusty brown ‚Ä¶ with gold glitter.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, reddish-brown with warm, orange undertones and a lot of gold glitter. It was richly pigmented, creamy, smooth, and blendable. A few sparkles fell out while blending out the edges, but I didn‚Äôt have any fall out during wear, and it was still going strong after ten hours of wear.",A+
COLOUR POP,MOONSHINE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúrich chocolate brown coated with gold glitter.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, chocolate brown with warm, orange undertones and a gold sparkle. It was incredibly soft, creamy, and smooth‚Äìvery dense‚Äìand intensely pigmented. This shade went on beautifully, and it was easy to work with as it didn‚Äôt lose intensity but still diffused around the edges without a lot of work. The color wore for ten hours without fading or creasing.",A+
COLOUR POP,RHINESTONE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúdeep blue green.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, blackened bluish-teal with a pearly shimmer. It had semi-opaque coverage, and it was somewhat buildable, but it had a little more slip to the consistency that made it harder to really layer for opaque coverage. The texture was smooth and blendable, and it still lasted a long time (ten hours).",A-
COLOUR POP,ELECTRIC SLIDE,Highlighter,"a ‚Äútrue gold.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, yellow gold with a pearly shimmer-sheen finish‚Äìpretty much just as the brand described it. The texture was smooth, creamy, and a cinch to blend out on the skin. I love that the formula can be used over foundation without disturbing your base products. The coverage is semi-sheer to opaque, depending on how much you apply initially or with what, which is in line with what the formula is supposed to be. The color was going strong after ten hours of wear.",A+
COLOUR POP,LEOPARD,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúvivid violet blue.‚Äù It‚Äôs a meidum-dark purple with cool, blue undertones and a satin-matte finish. It had semi-opaque coverage, and it was blendable along the edges, but the texture was dry and prone to crumbling when I applied too much pressure on it. Pressed Pigments are ‚Äúnot intended for the eye area,‚Äù so keep that in mind üôÇ I wore it as a blush, and it lasted for nine hours.",C-
URBAN DECAY,GWEN STEFANI,Palette," fifteen eyeshadows‚Äìtwelve that are new, three that are repromotes‚Äìhoused in a compact palette. It‚Äôs a good palette filled with mostly warm-toned neutrals in light and medium shades. The pops of color make it a little less typical, but I‚Äôm not sure they were the most suitable shades for this palette. I wish there was more differentiation between some of the shades, particularly in undertone. I personally wish that they had taken more inspiration from the artist‚Äôs body of work so that they could create a more versatile palette that would work with more skin tones than such a literal translation of Stefani‚Äôs look. If you like the shades and don‚Äôt already have a lot of neutral palettes, the quality is there, and the palette is a great value‚Äì$228 worth of eyeshadows!",B+
BOBBI BROWN,PALE MAUVE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúlight pinky mauve.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium pink with neutral-to-warm undertones and a natural sheen. The consistency was creamy, light-medium in weight, and glided on without tugging, but it wasn‚Äôt fully opaque and tended to accentuate lip lines. The color settled into lip lines over time, and the lipstick lasted for four hours on me with light hydration. This shade is a VIB Rouge exclusive.",B-
BOBBI BROWN,DOWNTOWN PLUM,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúneutral brown berry.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark plummy brown with warm undertones and a soft shine. It was richly pigmented with a really smooth, creamy consistency that applied beautifully to lips‚Äìeven, lush color. The color wore well for almost six hours and was moisturizing while worn.",A+
MAC,VON TEESE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúvivid tomato red [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium red with warm, orange undertones and a matte finish.",A
BITE BEAUTY,MAUVEMBER,Lipstick,"a muted, medium pinky lavender with subtle, cool undertones and a natural sheen.",A-
CHANEL,SIGNE PARTICULIER,Palette,"a limited edition palette for the holidays. I normally enjoy the formula Chanel uses with this type of imprint, but this year‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt as impressive‚Äìtwo shades were silky but powdery and two were drier on the skin. I would have loved to see the gold shade replaced with something distinctively cool-toned, which I think would make it more unique.",C+
YVES SAINT LAURENT,LE NU (70),Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbasic nude.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, rosy beige with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-opaque color payoff with noticeable translucency, which will let your natural lip color come through. The consistency was lightweight, thinner but still creamy, and applied evenly but the color gathered in lip lines after three hours of wear (total wear time was four hours).",B+
YVES SAINT LAURENT,BLACK RED (71),Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark burgundy red with subtle, warm undertones and a natural finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage with a creamy, smooth texture that glided on effortlessly and covered well. On me, the color lasted for nearly six hours, was comfortable to wear, and was hydrating, too. This shade is limited edition and exclusive to Sephora VIB Rouges (no idea if they‚Äôll ever release it to VIBs/BIs).",A
YVES SAINT LAURENT,CORAIL URBAIN (51),Lipstick,"a ‚Äúmedium peach orange.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, pink-coral with warm undertones and fine white pearl. It had mostly opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly, though there was still some translucency where the natural lip color came through slightly. The color wore well for four hours and was lightly hydrating over time, but I had some of the color pull into lip lines after two and a half hours of wear.",B+
YVES SAINT LAURENT,MAUVE NIHILISTE (58),Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep mauve.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, magenta purple with subtle, warmer undertones paired with lilac and white pearl. It had semi-opaque coverage that went on evenly and smoothly. The color lasted for four hours, was comfortable and lightly hydrating over time, and didn‚Äôt pull into lip lines like Corail Urbain did.",B+
BOBBI BROWN,PINK SAND,Lipstick,"a light-medium peach with subtle, warm beige tones and a natural sheen. It had great pigmentation with a lightweight, creamy consistency that glided on without tugging, and I was impressed at how even the color applied for a lighter shade. The color lasted for four hours, but I had some color settle into lip lines.",B+
BOBBI BROWN,HOT ROSE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark fuchsia pink with strong, blue undertones and a natural sheen. It had fully opaque coverage with a creamy, comfortable texture that applied smoothly and evenly. This shade lasted for six hours on me and left behind a noticeable stain.",A+
BOBBI BROWN,BRIGHT PEONY,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright yellow pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and a luminous sheen. It had rich, opaque color payoff that applied evenly and lasted for four and a half hours on me. The formula was nicely hydrating, but I noticed some color pulled into lip lines after three hours of wear.",A-
LAURA MERCIER,MATTE TO METAL,Palette,"six miniature-sized eyeshadow pencils. Four shades are part of the permanent range, while two (Ganache and Aubergine) are limited edition. The Caviar Stick formula is supposed to ‚Äúglide on smoothly‚Äù and ‚Äúblend effortlessly‚Äù while also being ‚Äúlong-wearing, transfer- and crease-resistant‚Äù with ‚Äúrich colour payoff.‚Äù Most of the shades I have tested from the formula are very good and true to the claims, though occasionally a shade is less pigmented or less blendable (but wear seems to be most consistent). The set contains $86.90 worth of product.",A
NARS,ONE SHOCKING MOMENT,Palette,"a highlight/contour duo, bronzer, and four blushes. Two of the blushes (Robotic and Blasphemy) are limited edition and exclusive to the palette, while the other products are part of the permanent range. For those keeping track of value, this palette contains: $36 worth of contour/highlight duo, $40 worth of bronzer (it is actually larger than a full-sized bronzer), and $90 worth of blush, which yields a total value of $166; this is good as far as palettes go, and it‚Äôs particularly good for high-end and for the NARS brand. I do think that a contouring duo is risky, since it will not suit all skin tones, and of course, we have seen Laguna umpteen amount of times, so that might be a waste for those who have a few NARS palettes already! Otherwise, it‚Äôs a decent to good palette that will be best for those who like buildable blushes, rather than richly pigmented ones.",B
GIORGIO ARMANI,ROSE PLATINUM (16),Eyeshadow,"a very pale, light-medium silvery lavender with flecks of warmer gold micro-shimmer. The color is interesting, because it‚Äôs both cool and warm; when applied at full coverage, it is cooler, but if sheered out, the gold shimmer seems to come more to the forefront and gives it a warmer appearance. The texture was lightweight, smooth, blendable, and semi-opaque to opaque. I prefer using a separate brush with these than the applicator (also, more sanitary! and given each of these contain so much product, I avoid double-dipping to maximize the life of the product!). The color lasted for twelve hours before creasing slightly (marketed as 16-hour wear).",B+
GIORGIO ARMANI,HOLLYWOOD (17),Eyeshadow,"a subdued, light-medium peachy gold with warm, brown udnertones and a metallic sheen. It had mostly opaque color coverage with a creamy, blendable texture that didn‚Äôt dry too fast or too slow, so it was easy to work with. The color lasted for thirteen hours on me.",B+
GIORGIO ARMANI,SILVER MIRAGE (18),Eyeshadow,"a light-medium, taupe brown with subtle, warm undertones and almost silver-like sheen. It had good pigmentation, and it was totally opaque when I later applied it on my lid with a brush, but the formula seems to yield somewhat variable results based on the pull of product‚Äìsometimes it is thinner, sometimes it is thicker. The texture is lightweight, easy to blend and apply to the skin, and dries down nicely. The color started to crease slightly after thirteen hours of wear.",B+
ANASTASIA,SELF-MADE,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette for the holidays that features 14 eyeshadows in various hues. The palette leans more neutral than colorful or bright, but there are a few pops of color (pink, purple, aqua). Probably the biggest surprise here is that there are only two official mattes and then one or two more that are satin-to-matte (like the black eyeshadow is effectively quite matte in practice). This is one of the best Anastasia palettes I‚Äôve tried to-date; it is well-worth the price point, and I think the color selection is at least a little more interesting than most palettes.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,CONFECTION,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúblush pink with very subtle gray undertones and a matte finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a pale, light pink with neutral-to-cool undertones and a matte finish. It was soft but powdery, and it accentuated the texture of my lid and clung to it in patches, which made the area look drier. It lasted for six and a half hours.",C
MAKEUP GEEK,ENCHANTED FOREST,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúmedium gray with strong brown undertones and a matte finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a soft, medium-dark taupe that leans gray with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. The texture was very soft but also quite powdery, so you‚Äôll want to apply less than you think you need and then build-up the color if necessary. It had good color payoff and lasted for seven hours on me.",B-
MAKEUP GEEK,CONCRETE JUNGLE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúdeep ivy green with black undertones and a matte finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, dark green with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good color payoff with a lightly dusty texture that was prone to sheering out on the lid and took some extra time to blend out. The color started to fade after seven hours of wear.",D+
MAKEUP GEEK,BEDROCK,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúdeep gray with subtle purple undertones and a matte finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark gray with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-sheer pigmentation with a dusty, thin consistency that was quick to fade (six hours). It was hard to maintain intensity on bare skin, as it would sheer out.",B-
MAKEUP GEEK,VINTAGE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúmedium brown with mauve undertones and a matte finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark reddish plum with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque color payoff that was somewhat buildable. The texture was thin, lightly dusty, and prone to sheering out. On me, the color wore for six hours before fading.",C-
MAKEUP GEEK,FUJI,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúbright apple green with a demi-matte finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, chartreuse green with warm, yellow undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a lightly powdery texture. The color lasted for seven and a half hours on me.",B-
MAKEUP GEEK,DRAGONFLY,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúbright medium teal with a matte finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark green with a hint of cooler, blue undertones and a matte finish. It had good color payoff with a soft, fairly smooth texture that was rather dusty. It sheered out quite a bit on bare skin, and it faded after six hours.",C
MAKEUP GEEK,BOO BERRY,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúdenim blue with gray undertones and a matte finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark cornflower blue with a matte finish. It had sheer color payoff that was difficult to build-up, even when patted on with a flat, dense brush. The only way it could be workable is over a slightly tacky, white base, which would give it something to cling to and help intensify the shade. The texture was incredibly powdery, which made it even harder to work with and prone to patchiness on the skin.",F
MAKEUP GEEK,TIME TRAVEL,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúdeep teal with gray undertones and a matte finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, dark teal with subtle, cool undertones and a very fine shimmer. The texture was thin, dusty, but it was fairly smooth at least! It yielded mostly opaque color payoff, as long as you don‚Äôt dare to blend it‚Äìotherwise it sheers out considerably and gets everywhere. Yet another disappointing eyeshadow from this release, and it makes one wonder what happened.",C
MAKEUP GEEK,STEALTH,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúmedium gray with strong slate blue undertones and a matte finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium bluish-gray with cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It was so powdery; it was like the product wasn‚Äôt binding together when pressed against the skin. It was messy to use, turned patchy, and was unimpressive. It lasted for six hours before fading noticeably.",D
TOM FORD BEAUTY,NIGHT SKY (01),Palette,"a full-sized powder eyeshadow and full-sized cream eyeshadow housed in a two-tiered component. They worked well together, but both were weaker on their own and less impressive as a result. The cream eyeshadow was hard to apply evenly; the darker color paired with greater slip yielded sheerer, streakier results, but the formula is buildable and opaque in two layers, so it can work. I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as good as past iterations of the cream eyeshadow formula (which I‚Äôm normally a huge fan of).",B+
MAC,EVENING RENDEZVOUS,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep reddish purple [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark purple with warm pink tones and a semi-matte finish.",A

BOBBI BROWN,RETRO RED,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúblue red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium red with subtle, cool undertones and a soft sheen. It was richly pigmented with a creamy, smooth consistency that applied beautifully. The color lasted for six and a half hours and was hydrating while worn.",A
BOBBI BROWN,RED VELVET,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep rich red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark brown-based red with warm undertones and a soft sheen. It had good color coverage with a really smooth, creamy texture that glided right on with even coverage. The color stayed on well for over six hours, left a light stain behind, and was hydrating over time.",A
BOBBI BROWN,PARISIAN RED,Lipstick,"a ‚Äútrue yellow red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium red with warm, yellow undertones and a glossy finish. It had very nearly opaque pigmentation with a very creamy, more emollient consistency (compared to the rest of the formula) that applied well without streaking. I didn‚Äôt have any issues with feathering/bleeding, but it has enough slip that it could be a concern for those who experience those issues more often. It wore well for six hours and was moisturizing while worn.",A
MAC,FULL FUCHSIA,Blush,"a ‚Äúbright intense fuchsia [with a Frost finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, bright, medium fuchsia-pink with strong, blue undertones and a fine shimmer-sheen.",A-

MAC,IRRESISTIBLY CHARMING/VIOLET,Palette,"one shade of Dazzleglass and three shades of Cremesheen Glass. For long-time collectors, this will be your best bet between the three lipgloss sets as three of the shades are new (Narcissus is a repromote). MAC‚Äôs holiday lipgloss sets are actually one of their best values, because while the tubes may look short, they actually contain 0.08 oz. each! But this is the crazy part: full-sized Dazzleglasses are a mere 0.06 oz., while full-sized Cremesheen Glasses are 0.09 oz. The set contains $26.67 worth of Dazzleglass and $53.33 worth of Cremesheen Glass, which makes the set have a total value of $80.00. The holiday sets are a great way to restock your glosses, if you like the formula or shades. The sets often repeat from year to year and have a mix of often-repromoted-limited-editions as well as permanent options. Cremesheen Glass is sheerer, lightweight, comfortable without being sticky, with short wear time (one to three hours). Dazzleglass is thicker, glossier, sparkly (or glittery), sticky, and typically sheer but have longer wear time (two to four hours).",B

BOBBI BROWN,PALE CORAL,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúmidtone coral cream.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium peach-orange with warm undertones and a creamy, lightly glossy finish. The texture was quite creamy with light-to-medium weight to it, so it was thick enough where you could see ‚Äúlines‚Äù if you pressed your lips together, and the more emollient consistency made it harder to apply evenly.

SEPHORA,POMEGRANATE DELIRIUM (20),Lipgloss,"a slightly muted, medium-dark pinky-plum with gold and pink sparkle. It had semi-opaque color payoff with noticeable sparkle and shimmer. It applied evenly and smoothly without feeling gritty. The gloss lasted for four hours on me.",A-
SEPHORA,HAPPY SUNRISE (25),Lipgloss,"a medium, peachy-orange with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque color payoff with some translucency that allowed the natural lip color to come through. The texture was lightweight, comfortable to wear, and forgiving on the lips. The color lasted for three and a half hours on me.",B
SEPHORA,GORGEOUS RED (29),Lipgloss,"a medium-dark, fuchsia pink with lighter violet and lavender micro-shimmer.

MAC,ENCHANTED EYES/MAUVE,Palette,"six eyeshadows with a mauve (more purple to me) theme. Three of the shades (Lightfully, Subtly Elegant, and Magic Moor) have been released in past palettes but are not part of the permanent range. This is a dud palette to me, and it‚Äôs pretty much a good example of why MAC‚Äôs holiday palettes are no longer highly anticipated. The holidays used to mean a good deal on great eyeshadows from MAC, but now it seems like rinse and repeat with so-so shades that do more to ruin the brand‚Äôs reputation than enhance it. Their lip and pigment sets are still (usually) worth checking out, at least.",D
NARS,KILLER HEELS,Palette,"five miniature-sized lipsticks from NARS past and present range. It is a Sephora exclusive, so it‚Äôll launch on November 1st. NARS‚Äô Lipsticks retail for $27.00 for 0.12 oz., so the kit has a total value of $56.25.",B
MAKEUP GEEK,INSOMNIA,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúred-brown base with blue reflects.‚Äù It‚Äôs a warm, coppery-red base with bluish-teal shift. It‚Äôs one of the more common duochromes that you‚Äôll find across brands (sometimes they lean blue, sometimes they lean green). The texture is smoother than the original iteration of this shade was, and it had semi-sheer to semi-opaque pigmentation applied dry but was more opaque damp. The color wore well for eight hours before fading.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,HOLOGRAM,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúorange-pink base with green and gold reflects.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium pink-coral with warm undertones that shifts to a green-tinged gold with a metallic finish. It had one of the stronger duochromes in the release. The texture was soft, finely-milled, and smooth. It had semi-opaque coverage dry, fully opaque coverage damp, and damp application also yielded a brighter, more metallic sheen. This shade lasted for eight hours on me.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,WILDFIRE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúred-coral base with gold reflects.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, rosy pink with warm undertones paired with gold frost. It was less of a duochrome and more of a nuanced color. The texture was soft, smooth, and blendable, while the coverage was semi-sheer applied dry and mostly opaque applied damp. This shade wore well for eight hours.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,PRISM,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúwhite base with peachy-pink reflects.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, gray-ish white with a frosted sheen that shifts to a warm pink-peach. The texture is very finely-milled but almost powdery on me, and it applied and was easier to work with over a base or patted over another eyeshadow to add a sheen as it looked dry on its own. It lasted for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
NARS,MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION,Palette,"three warm red-hued lip products. You can wear them together or alone, and they coordinate well together.",B+
NARS,AN ABNORMAL FEMALE,Palette,"three full-sized Velvet Matte Lip Pencils, and all three are shades that are part of the permanent range, so if you like one, you may find it better to just pick up the one you want. Of all the packaging in the collection, this is the most unique, and it is more unique relative to other special edition packaging I‚Äôve seen from brands in general. The Velvet Matte Lip Pencil formula can be drying, and it doesn‚Äôt always have the pigmentation expected, which are its major downsides.",B+
MAC,TROPIC TONIC,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúfull power coral [with a matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium coral with subtle pink tones and a satin finish.",A
CHANEL,ROUGE NOIR (18),NailPolish,"a ‚Äúblack red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a deep, dark purpled berry with a cream finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage with a slightly translucent, stained-like quality to it that made it seem very rich on the nail. The consistency wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin, so it applied easily. I get around seven days of wear with Chanel‚Äôs formula with minor tip wear but no chipping.",A-
CHANEL,ROSE FUSION (757),NailPolish,"a ‚Äúluminous purple grey.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark purple taupe with a metallic shimmer that looks browner in some lighting, purpler in others. It is a chameleon of a shade, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be a genuine duochrome, just multi-faceted with different shades of shimmer. It was opaque after two coats, and the polish‚Äôs texture seemed a little thick. There are noticeable brush lines from the metallic shimmer, so it takes a steady hand and some patience to minimize their appearance.",B+
CHANEL,LAME ROUGE NOIR,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúshimmering black red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a pinky-red tinted clear base with larger gold sparkle. The key with this one is to really shake the bottle prior to using, because the glitter they use seems heavy to the point where it all sinks to the bottom of the bottle. The base is definitely tinted and will bring out the pinks in the nail, but it will obviously complement Rouge Noir polish as well. The glitter had good density in one coat, so it will work as a top coat well, and it added a ton of glossy shine.",A-
SEPHORA,CAPPUCCINO (02),Lipgloss,"a light-medium, orange-peach with light beige shimmer and sparkle. It had semi-sheer color coverage that did pull into lip lines but the color portion looked even. I think this is better suited for layering to avoid the obvious color gathering in the lip lines. It wore well for three hours on me and was hydrating over time.",C+
SEPHORA,NUDE ALERT (08),Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark coral with copper and gold shimmer. It had semi-opaque color payoff that applied evenly and smoothly. The shimmer is fine and gives it an almost metallic-like sheen at times, as there is quite a bit of it. The consistency is lightweight and comfortable to wear over the four and a half hours it lasted.",A-
SEPHORA,CHERRY BLOSSOM (11),Lipgloss,"a translucent pink. Sephora lists it as ‚Äúclear,‚Äù though their descriptions seem to be more of the finish type (shimmer, clear, etc.), because ‚Äúclear‚Äù lines up with all of the very jelly-like glosses that are definitely sheerer but almost all have a tint of some sort (which is confusing as well as makes it harder to rate appropriately). It had a light-medium thick, more gel-like consistency (almost like petroleum jelly with less creaminess and more weight). It seems to make my natural lip color appear a smidgen darker (which is what a lot of glossy balms do) and cooler in overall tone, but it is pretty much a clear gloss. It lasted for three hours on me.",C+
MAC,SHAFT OF GOLD,Highlighter,"a ‚Äúdeep bronze.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, orange-brown with warm undertones and a frosted gold shimmer-sheen finish.",A-
NARS,DEAD OF SUMMER,Palette,"four Dual-Intensity eyeshadows and a travel-sized Via Veneto eyeliner, which is part of the permanent range. The palette includes Subra, which is also part of the permanent range. The palette contains $69.60 worth of eyeshadow and $12.50 worth of eyeliner, making the palette worth $82.10. (Note: the back of the palette says 0.30 oz. worth of product, but each shade is 0.03 oz., which is what is written on the box packaging alongside the ingredient lists). I liked the palette, but the shades are on the dupable end, and Subra has been released previously in a palette, so seeing it again feels unnecessarily repetitive. The Dual-Intensity formula is supposed to give eight-hour, can be used wet or dry (dry for ‚Äúsheer soft touch of sensual color‚Äù and wet for ‚Äúhigh-impact finish‚Äù). They are sheerer applied dry, but I find them surprisingly buildable dry as well, so it takes two to three layers, and it doesn‚Äôt take real packing on, just going back for a little more product. They will be more intense right off the bat if applied with a damp brush, though, which is as described. The formula has a soft, finely-milled feel to it, and they‚Äôre very smooth and easily blended on the skin. The only downside is the wear varies anywhere from six to nine hours, and dry application seems to consistently wear between six and seven hours before creasing, whereas damp application lasts slightly longer with seven to nine hours of wear.",A-
NARS,FAST LIFE,Lipgloss,"an ‚Äúiridescent dusty rose.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark pink with warm undertones and a heaping dose of fine pink, gold, and beige micro-shimmer. It had mostly opaque color payoff with a smooth formula that applied evenly. The consistency was somewhat tacky over time, though not goopy or uncomfortable to wear. This shade wore for four and a half hours and was neither hydrating nor drying.",A-
NARS,PROVOKE,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúdeep iris-purple.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark purple-berry with subtle, warm undertones and fine violet shimmer. It had semi-opaque color coverage that went on fairly evenly, but it could have been a little improved on that front. The texture was light-medium in weight, comfortable to wear with moderate tackiness after an hour of wear. It lasted for four hours in total.",B
NARS,SPECIAL FORCE,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúwild strawberry.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium-dark red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. The texture is light-medium in thickness‚Äìnot heavy or goopy but not thin either‚Äìand is very lightly tacky initially but is moderately tacky after a couple of hours of wear. It had mostly opaque color payoff that applied evenly, and the gloss lasted for four and a half hours on me. It was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,KALEIDOSCOPE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúslate blue base with pink, purple, and teal reflects.‚Äù It‚Äôs a dirty gray with lighter blue, green, pink, and silver metallic shimmer. It had a lot going on, but it looked almost muddied when applied and blended on the skin, so I think it is one that would really benefit from being layered over some sort of base color. It had semi-sheer coverage applied dry, and then mostly opaque pigmentation applied damp. It is a more frosted texture, so it isn‚Äôt quite as finely-milled as some of the range, but it isn‚Äôt chunky and is fairly blendable on the lid. The color started to crease after eight hours of wear.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,MOOD RING,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúpale gray base with purple-pink reflects.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, light bluish-gray that shifts to pink and violet as the light reflects off of the shimmer. It had semi-opaque coverage applied dry and full intensity applied damp, and it was smoother to work with when it was damp, as the texture was so finely milled that it almost didn‚Äôt bind as well without added moisture. On me, it wore well for eight and a half hours before creasing.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,SUGAR RUSH,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äútranslucent base with icy blue and purple reflects.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, pink-tinged white base with iridescent green-to-teal shimmer that creates a frosted, metallic finish. The color shifted from more green iridescence to pinky-violet iridescence. It had semi-sheer pigmentation applied dry and fully opaque coverage applied damp. The consistency was soft, blendable, and smooth. It wore well for eight hours on me.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,CHAMELEON,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúdeep teal base with gold reflects.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium blue base with lighter gold frost that gives it a mostly metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque coverage applied dry, but it was a much softer, lighter blue when compared to damp application, which was deeper and fully opaque. This shade lasted for eight hours before creasing on me.",A-
CHANEL,TISSE JAZZ (244),Palette,"a blue-hued quad that runs on the more muted/subtler side, so it may be an option for ‚Äúwearable‚Äù blues if the brighter blues aren‚Äôt your wheelhouse. I wish the first shade was more pigmented, but the four shades work well together. I think the blendability of the products was the high point, while pigmentation levels were the low point.",B+
GUERLAIN,PERLES DES NEIGES,Highlighter,"a ‚Äúfrosted light, radiance, and iridescence.‚Äù It‚Äôs a translucent, gold-shimmered beige with a luminous sheen.",A
BOBBI BROWN,NEUTRAL ROSE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúneutral pinky rose.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark rosy pink with warm undertones and a moderate shine. It was richly pigmented with true, one-stroke color payoff. The texture was creamy, light-to-medium in weight (not heavy, but it‚Äôs not featherweight), and comfortable to wear. The color wore well for four and a half hours, while the formula was nicely hydrating from start to finish.",A
BOBBI BROWN,PINK BUFF,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúcreamy nude beige.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark rosy brown with warm undertones and a creamy finish paired with moderate shine. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single pass of product, and the color distributed evenly and smoothly over the lips. The glossier finish combined with the full coverage made lips look plumper and fuller. This shade wore well for four and a half hours, and it was hydrating while worn.",A
BOBBI BROWN,SOFT BERRY,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúneutral rose berry.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark rosy plum with subtle, warm undertones and a luminous shine. It had rich, opaque color coverage with a creamy consistency that glided on easily. The color wore well for five hours, and it was moisturizing during as well as after it wore away.",A
TOO FACED,LE GRAND PALAIS,Palette,"a large, limited edition holiday set that has a little bit of everything, but it is primarily an eyeshadow and blush palette with a few extras thrown in. There are a lot of chunky, glittery eyeshadows included in the palette, which are difficult to use without a really good tacky primer (which is why I think they should have included their own Glitter Glue adhesive instead of their regular eyeshadow primer!). The packaging is very giftable, but it is bulky, so those who have a fair amount of palettes in their stash may find that a lot of the packaging ends up in the recycling bin. This review is focused only on the eyeshadows and cheek products and excludes the primer, mascara, and liquid lip color (that I‚Äôve reviewed as a standalone product in the past).",C+
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,AMAZING GRACE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, pink-coral with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff with a lightly velvety consistency that didn‚Äôt drag on lips, but it had a thinner feel and clung a bit. This shade lasted for five hours, was lightly drying over time, and there was slight settling in lip lines after three hours of wear.",B
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,LOST CHERRY,Lipstick,"a medium, pink-coral with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. This may be the closest one gets to a ‚Äúcool‚Äù coral, even though is still warm-toned (kind of like a ‚Äúwarmer‚Äù blue). It had mostly opaque color coverage with a smooth, velvety texture that glided across lips easily. The color lasted for five hours, wore well, and was neither drying nor hydrating over time.",A-
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,SEXY SIENNA,Lipstick,"a muted, light-medium peach-coral with warm undertones and a mostly matte finish‚Äìthere are teeny, tiny shimmers in it to my eye. It had full color payoff with a soft, velvety feel that was comfortable to wear while being lightweight. It wore well for four hours, and it was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
MAC,BRIGHT PINK BOUQUET,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúnude coral.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, orange-coral with lighter pink and white pearl. It swatched much brighter than it looked in the tube or applied, but it isn‚Äôt a vibrant coral on, which is where it counts. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which made it the most pigmented of the three (the Cremesheen Glass formula is a sheerer range). The color applied easily and was comfortable to wear over the three hours it lasted.",B+
MAC,LOVE OF ROSES,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äútrue red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a vibrant, medium-dark pinky-red with cool, blue undertones and a mostly cream finish. It had semi-sheer color coverage, which made it look almost like a lip stain with a glossy finish applied. The gloss went on evenly for the most part, but there was a little gloss that you could see that darkened lip lines. The color lasted for two and a half hours on me, while the formula was lightly moisturizing over time.",B+
MAC,PALE MOON,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúmid-tone pink nude.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, peachy-coral with lighter gold and white pearl. It had semi-sheer color coverage with noticeable shimmer. The consistency is lightweight, comfortable to wear as it is smooth and mostly non-sticky. It lasted for two and a half hours on me, and it was lightly hydrating.",B+
ANASTASIA,PAINT,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, navy blue with lighter, brighter navy blue pearl paired with a matte finish (more like a ‚Äúmatte frost‚Äù).",B
MAC,STYLE,Blush,"a ‚Äúcoral peach with gold pearl [with a Frost finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, orange-coral with warm undertones and a soft, golden shimmer.",A-
CHANEL,TISSE SMOKY (246),Palette,"a set of shades to give you a classic, gray smoky eye. It‚Äôs by no means particularly unique, but if you tend to go for a softer, smoky eye in shades of gray, you may appreciate having them altogether. I prefer using this one damp, even though Chanel doesn‚Äôt seem to call out this formula as a wet/dry one (but it has that baked-like texture that lends itself well to the dual application), but that being said, this one isn‚Äôt ‚Äúpigment-rich‚Äù for most shades when used dry.",A-
MAC,SIMPLY SWINGING,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúgrey lilac.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, light-medium lavender purple with neutral-to-warm undertones and a cream finish. The consistency was slightly thick, and it didn‚Äôt level out as much as it could have, so some areas looked thicker and more opaque than others. It had a really nice high-shine finish, though. After two coats, it had mostly opaque coverage. I typically get a week of wear out of MAC‚Äôs polish.",B
MAC,BLOG THIS,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúdeep purple plum.‚Äù It‚Äôs a blackened purpled berry with cool undertones and a cream finish. It had mostly opaque coverage, but it tended to be quite streaky on the initial coat and was mostly covered by the second coat, though not entirely so it may require a third coat or good base coat. The consistency ran thin but didn‚Äôt pool along the edges. I typically get a week of wear out of MAC‚Äôs polish.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,PLUM OMBRE,Blush,"a light-medium, pinky-plum with warm undertones and a mostly matte finish.",F
MAC,OWN THE LOOK,Lipstick,"Äúdeep intense pearl.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark purple with warm pink undertones and a very subtle violet shimmer. It had semi-opaque color payoff that glided on without tugging on the lips, but it didn‚Äôt apply as evenly as I would have liked. The color pulled into lip lines noticeably after three and a half hours of wear, though it lasted for closer to five and a half hours of wear. It was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
MAC,PERSONAL PICK,Lipstick,"Äúmid-tone cool rose.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, light-medium pink with subtle, cool undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had fairly good color payoff with a lightly creamy consistency that didn‚Äôt tug or pull at the lips during application. The texture is lightweight and thin enough that it can emphasize the natural texture of the lips, so I would recommend exfoliating and/or hydrating heavily prior to applying this shade. The color lasted for four hours with slight settling into lip lines.",B
MAC,POWER MY SPIRIT,Lipstick,"Äúdeep black plum.‚Äù It‚Äôs a blackened purple with subtle, cool undertones and plum and eggplant-hued micro-shimmer. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque color coverage, but this was a really difficult shade to apply‚Äìso patchy and uneven with too much slip to keep it looking pristine, even if applied with a lip brush. It needs a lip liner underneath to help keep it in place. The color lasted for five hours but settles a lot into lip lines.",D
MAC,STRUTTING FABULOUS,Lipstick,"Äúbright lavender.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, lavender purple with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque pigmentation with a lightly creamy texture that didn‚Äôt pull on the lips. The finish is definitely more matte, and when paired with the thinner texture, it isn‚Äôt the most flattering when worn. It pulled into lip lines a little bit over the five hours it lasted. I wish it was a little smoother-looking once applied, because the color is hard to replicate.",B+
ANASTASIA,RIVIERA,Highlighter,"a ‚Äúsun-kissed coppery hue.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, taupe brown with warm, rosy undertones and a metallic sheen.",A
MAC,A LITTLE LUSTY,Blush,an ‚Äúintense red berry.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark red with warm undertones and a satin finish.,A-
VISEART,COOL MATTE (07),Palette,"twelve shades of (mostly) cooler-toned, matte eyeshadows. I thought that Viseart would be the hero of cool-toned palettes, but this palette was a miss. There are too many shades that are under-pigmented and have a powdery or dusty texture, which just made it a harder-to-use palette overall. Of course, it had to be the cool-toned palette that had the most misses. For someone who often uses primer and expects to pair this with other products, it might still work, but the higher price point coupled with so-so performance (especially compared to other Viseart palettes) makes this a disappointing palette.",B-
ANASTASIA,SO HOLLYWOOD,Highlighter,"a ‚Äúshimmery bronze hue.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, yellow gold with warm undertones and a frosted, metallic finish.",A-
CHRISTIAN LOUBATIN,MISS LOUBI,Lipstick,"a brightened, coral-red with warm undertones and a luminous sheen.",A
LIPSTICK QUEEN,FROG PRINCE,Lipstick,"Äúpink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, raspberry pink with cool undertones and a light shine.",A
COLOUR POP,MIDI,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúsoft neutral beige.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, pinky-beige with a matte finish. The texture was really clingy when it dried down and emphasized the lines/texture of the natural lip. I found this shade flaked off as it wore, and it wore away more readily from the center of the mouth within four hours. The formula was also drying and extremely fast-drying.",C
COLOUR POP,SEESAW,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúpastel lavender pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, pinky lavender with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. This one had good pigmentation but dried down quickly and cracked as soon as it finished drying, so it flaked a lot during wear. It felt awkward to wear (you could just feel something was on your lips) and lasted four hours before it had flaked too much to keep wearing. It was drying while worn.",D+
CHRISTIAN LOUBATIN,ETON MOI,Lipstick,"a purpled berry with subtle, cool pink undertones and a satin finish.",B+
KAT VON D,DOCE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúmetallic copper.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium-dark copper with warm, red-orange undertones and a frosted finish.",A+
CHANEL,MELODY (98),Eyeshadow,"a soft, light-medium peach with a hint of pink and a pearly sheen.",B
MAC,TEASE DON'T TOUCH,Lipgloss,"an ‚Äúintense true red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium red with strong, pink tones and leans bluer. It had a fair amount of color payoff, but you‚Äôll see the natural lip come through somewhat (my lip freckle is still there), but it looks really even and smooth‚ÄìI was surprised at just how supple the lips looked. It wore well for five hours, was comfortable and hydrating over time.",A-
MAC,PEER PRESSURE,Lipgloss,"an ‚Äúintense red-burgundy.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, dark berry with reddish tones and a creamy, shiny finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation‚Äìalmost looks like a stain than gloss‚Äìwith a slightly thin consistency that still spread well but was less glossy compared to other shades in the range. It applied with smooth, even coverage, which is tough for darker, less pigmented glosses, and it wore for five hours on me.",A-
MAC,SUGGESTIVE,Lipgloss,"an ‚Äúintense blue-red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium-dark red with cool, pinky undertones and a creamy, shiny finish. It had good pigmentation, but there‚Äôs some translucency so the natural lip color will come through still. It applied really well, though, with even coverage and never looked streaky and somehow managed not to slip into lip lines until after four to five hours of wear. The color lasted for five hours in all and was hydrating over time.",A-
COLOUR POP,INTOXICATE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúcaramel brown.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, yellowed brown with warm, orange undertones and a satin finish. It had good pigmentation with a soft, smooth, and creamy consistency that blended out nicely on the skin without sheering out. I had no issues applying it with a brush (MAC 242), but you can also use fingertips if you prefer. It wore well for ten hours without fading or creasing.",A
COLOUR POP,JET,Eyeshadow,"an ‚Äúalmost black with the slightest hint of warmth.‚Äù It‚Äôs a blackened purple with warm, brown edges and a mostly matte finish. It had fairly opaque pigmentation with a smooth consistency that wasn‚Äôt wet to the touch, but it wasn‚Äôt dry or stiff to use. It does have a tendency to sheer out a bit along the edges and looks more maroon than black unless really layered. The color lasted for ten hours before I noticed any fading.",A-
MILANI,DESIRE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a smooth, matte finish. It was intensely pigmented and applied with even coverage, though the more liquid-y consistency does make it a little harder to maneuver around the edges. As always, I recommend trying to remove excess product from the applicator or using a lip brush to make it easier to apply. It wore well for eight hours with minimal fading and was a little drying after seven hours.",A-
MILANI,ROMANCE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark red with cool, blue undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation but a translucency to it‚Äìyou could see my lip freckle coming through‚Äìbut doesn‚Äôt look streaky, which was a surprise. It had a softer look to it than some liquid matte lipsticks do as a result. It wore for six and a half hours and left a stain behind, and it was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
MAC,SPEED UP,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúbubblegum pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium pink with cool, blue undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. It had good pigmentation, though it wasn‚Äôt fully opaque, that applied evenly but had a tendency to emphasize lip lines. I noticed some of the gloss settled more noticeably as it wore on (after about two hours), but it wasn‚Äôt the worst I‚Äôve seen‚Äìprobably one of the better-wearing and -looking light pinks from MAC in gloss-form in awhile. This shade wore well for four hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",B
MAC,A FOR ATTITUDE,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúhot pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff that went on fairly evenly, though there were very slight lines if I pressed my lips together‚Äìthe more neon quality to it helped to make these lines harder to see at a normal viewing distance. On me, it was lightly hydrating over the five hours it lasted.",A-
MAC,WHAT'S GOING ON,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúhot intense fuchsia.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, brightened, medium-dark deep pink with fuchsia shimmer and a glossy finish. It had mostly opaque pigmentation that applied very smoothly and evenly. If you have naturally darker lips, I could see this going on a bit more muted or deeper as a result, since there is some visible lip color coming through. It wore well for five hours and was moderately hydrating while worn.",A-
MAC,PINCH O' PEACH,Blush,"a ‚Äúpeachy pink [with a Satin finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a lightly brightened, light-medium pink with soft, warm undertones and a mostly matte finish.",A-
LAURA MERCIER,GILDED GOLD,Eyeshadow,"a dirtied, medium yellowed gold with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-sheer color payoff in one stroke, and it was buildable to mostly opaque coverage but was more challenging to blend for me. It seemed prone to skipping on the skin, and it was one that applied a lot better with a separate brush (try a flat, synthetic one). It wore well for nine hours before creasing.",C+
LAURA MERCIER,ORCHID,Eyeshadow,"a softened, light-medium lavender with warm undertones and a frosted finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a fairly soft, blendable consistency that lasted for eight hours before showing signs of creasing. I wish it had been a little creamier in consistency to make for better application.",C+
LAURA MERCIER,PLUM,Eyeshadow,"a blackened plum purple with warm undertones and a soft, sprinkling of plum shimmer. It had mostly opaque pigmentation with some creaminess, but it was a challenge to blend due to it drying down very quickly‚ÄìI didn‚Äôt feel like I had much time to work with it before the edges became unmovable. Once it set, it stayed on well for nine hours.",B-
LAURA MERCIER,SEASHELL,Eyeshadow,"a brightened, white gold with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had good pigmentation in a single stroke, and this shade was more like I remember the formula being: creamy without being too slippery, so it applied with even, smooth coverage on the lid and then wore all day long (nine hours)‚Äìbut it was still blendable and easy to use. The others weren‚Äôt as foolproof.",A-
MAC,AZALEA,Blush,"a ‚Äúbright iridescent blue pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, brightened, medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool violet pearl that gives it a luminous finish.",A
MAC,BLACK SANDS,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúblack with green pearl.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark black with light blue and green pearl paired with neutral-to-cool undertones. It had semi-sheer coverage, and it was really patchy/difficult to blend as it never looked even. It lasted for seven hours before creasing.",C-
MAC,EMERALD POWER,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúemerald green.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark emerald green with neutral-to-cool undertones and a pearly sheen. There was a lot of slip to the texture, which resulted in more uneven, patchy coverage. The color wore for eight hours at least!",C+
MAC,IN ORBIT,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúlight warm neutral.‚Äù It‚Äôs a sparkling, golden copper with warm undertones and a pearly sheen paired with copper sparkle. It had semi-sheer pigmentation that was somewhat buildable. This was the better-applyling shade out of the four, but it added a noticeable texture to the lid due to the chunkier consistency. I had some fall out over the eight hours it lasted.",D+
MAC,ELECTRIC ILLUMINATION,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúbright silver.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, very light silver with lighter white and silver sparkle. It had semi-sheer color payoff, and the texture was noticeably chunky, so it didn‚Äôt apply evenly and the glittery bits often clumped together. I had some fall out over time, though the ‚Äúcolor‚Äù didn‚Äôt seem to crease for eight hours.",D
SEPHORA,FLIRT IT UP (06),Blush,"a brightened, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a mostly matte finish.",B+
COLOUR POP,CRUEL INTENTIONS,Blush,"a ‚Äúwarm rose.‚Äù It‚Äôs a lightly brightened, medium pink with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had buildable coverage, and it applied with the most pigmentation with fingertips (exactly as described), but I had no problems using a stippling brush and using two layers for color. The texture was lightweight and blended out easily, more like a powder in that respect, and it wore for nine and a half hours on me. ",A
COLOUR POP,NEVER BEEN KISSED,Blush,"a ‚Äúdusty coral.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium coral with a hint of pink and warm undertones paired with a matte finish. The texture was smooth, blendable, and felt like a powder as soon as it hit the skin. The color payoff was buildable, just as described by the brand, and you‚Äôll get the most opaque coverage with fingertips while brushes will yield less coverage, but the payoff is buildable in two to three layers. This shade wore for nine hours before fading on me.",A
COLOUR POP,GIRL POWER,Blush,"a ‚Äúbright red orange.‚Äù It‚Äôs an intense, medium-dark orange with warm red undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had good pigmentation with a smooth, blendable texture. It is a Pressed Pigment, and they are ‚Äúnot intended for use in the immediate eye area.‚Äù I‚Äôve tested and used it as a blush, where it performed well‚Äìit blended out without issue and lasted for nine and a half hours.",A-
COLOUR POP,BE-DAZZLED,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep true purple.‚Äù It‚Äôs a lightly brightened, medium purple with cool undertones and a vinyl-like sheen. It doesn‚Äôt dry down to a fully flat matte finish like a lot of the other shades have. It had mostly opaque pigmentation with a thin consistency that is a little harder to apply evenly. The formula feels clingier and really emphasizes the natural texture and lines on the lips in a way that makes them look somewhat shirveled‚Äìit‚Äôs not as soft or smooth as the average ColourPop liquid lipstick. I noticed the color flaking away from the center of the mouth after four hours of wear, and it was fairly drying over time, though most of the color lasted for six and a half hours.",C+
COLOUR POP,GUESS,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdark blackened violet.‚Äù It‚Äôs a blackened purple with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation (one of the least pigmented shades I‚Äôve encountered in the line-up!) that dries down to a mostly matte finish. Unfortunately, as it is a very dark color, that sheerness also came with unevenness. It wore for eight hours without flaking, and it was moderately drying after six and a half hours of wear.",B-
BECCA COSMETICS,BACKLIGHT,Highlighter,"a ‚Äúmakeup primer to help blur imperfections and impart a radiant glow.‚Äù It‚Äôs a sheer, golden beige with a luminous sheen and fine pearl.",A
COLOUR POP,DR. M,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep blackened green.‚Äù It‚Äôs a cool-toned, green-leaning teal with very, very subtle emerald green pearl. It‚Äôs such a cool color, and I love that it applied with fully opaque, even color, but it emphasizes the texture/lines of the natural lip tremendously in a way that makes them appear raisin-like. Despite this, it didn‚Äôt seem to ‚Äúcrack‚Äù when I smiled, but it was a little more uncomfortable to wear (I felt more aware of it on than other shades in the range, even for liquid lipstick). It wore for nine hours and was moderately drying after five hours of wear.",A-
COLOUR POP,KAPOW,Lipstick,"av‚Äúmuted greey taupe.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, purpled taupe with neutral-to-cool undertones and a matte finish. This was less of a flat matte finish and more of your traditional matte finish, and this shade had a much longer drying time compared to a lot of the range, so you‚Äôll need to be careful as it dries down to avoid pressing your lips together or else the color will lift/flake off where the lips meet. I had very slight ‚Äúcracking‚Äù with this shade after an hour and a half of wear. It was fairly comfortable to wear until four hours, where it felt a bit drying,a nd it lasted for seven hours.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,ROUGIR,Lipstick,"a translucent pink that looked like a barely-tint of pink that gave my lips a soft sheen. I find this type of product harder to review, as they look similar across the shades and, to some degree, depend on one‚Äôs natural lip color, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like the type of product where the shade itself matters much. The texture was lightweight, balm-like but not too slippery, and comfortable to wear, but it the comfort and hydration lasted less than two hours and never felt like it nourished over the long term‚Äìlike it only felt hydrating while worn.",C+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,UNIVERSEL,Lipstick,"a translucent peach when swatched, and it seemed to add a smidgen of warmth to my natural lip color but it was hard to tell. From a normal viewing distance, it looked the same as most of the other shades in the range, though this was the original shade that launched (and then spawned three more this season). It had a lightweight, balm-like consistency that felt emollient but wasn‚Äôt thick, heavy, or too slippery on my lips. The product was comfortable to wear and felt like it kept my lips hydrated while it was on, but after wearing the formula back-to-back, my lips didn‚Äôt feel hydrated after it wore down. The shine lasted for an hour and a half (and it lost its comfort by that point).",C+
COLOUR POP,SALVAJE,Palette,"a new, limited edition mix of warmer neutrals and pops of blue/teal. What I liked about some of the neutrals in the palette was the inclusion of shades like Malbec and Sangria, which are very red-toned but almost ‚Äúcool‚Äù in tone compared to the typical red/berry shades we see. The quality was good across 11 of the 12 shades; I only had issues with Corona, which was a more loosely-pressed, more glittery shade that worked fine with a dampened brush or fingertip (what I‚Äôd consider easily solvable).",A-
COLOUR POP,NIX AND NOX,Palette,"a pale, bluish-teal and silvery-taupe where both shades had a glittery finish. They had wetter textures, which made them less pigmented harder to build up; they would work better as layering shades. When I applied Nox over Nix (lighter over darker), it created a silvery sage green. Both shades did last awhile, and I had slight fallout with Nix but no visible fallout with Nox.",C
COLOUR POP,ICE DREAM,Eyeshadow,"a deep, navy blue with strong, cool undertones and a pearly sheen. It had good color coverage, though it wasn‚Äôt opaque and needed to be layered for greater coverage and more true-to-pan intensity. The texture felt smooth and thin with noticeable slip, and it blended out fairly easily. This shade stayed on nicely for 10 hours on me.",C
COLOUR POP,LEFT ON THREAD,Eyeshadow,"a deep, faded blue with subtle, cool undertones‚Äìit almost read as a ‚Äúwarm‚Äù blue‚Äìwith larger, pale gold glittery flecks. The texture felt wet to the touch and smooth, but it had a little more slip than ideal, as it resulted in a more translucent base that was harder to even out on my skin. It wore well for 10 hours without fading or creasing but had light fallout.",A
COLOUR POP,MIJA,Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had rich color payoff that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips without sinking into my lip lines. The consistency was lightly creamy, smooth, and thin without being watery, which helped it spread well across my lips. It stayed on nicely for five and a half hours and was non-drying.",A
COLOUR POP,SECRETO,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark, reddish-copper with warmer undertones and a matte finish. It had a faded quality to it and coupled with the matte finish, it was harder to dupe. The texture was lightweight, spreadable, and thin but was not too runny. I was able to apply the color evenly across my lips, and it dried down within 30 seconds. The dry down wasn‚Äôt forgiving, though, and it emphasized barely-there flakes (this was the last in a swatch session of 15, so my lips are about as smooth as I can get ‚Äôem!) and ‚Äúcracked‚Äù slightly along some of my deeper lip lines. It lasted for six and a half hours but was drying over time.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,109 GOLDEN,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, coppery-brown base with gold-to-green shifting sparkle and shimmer. It had a stronger, more pigmented base to it, and it seemed to melt a bit more on more normal-to-oily skin (rather than dry, like my arm) and didn‚Äôt sheer out too readily but would be best applied with a dampened brush or used with a tacky base/adhesive spray for maximum coverage and minimal fallout. The texture felt as finely-milled as expected, given it had a lot of sparkles in it.",B
COLOUR POP,SWEET NOTHINGS,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette exclusively available at Ulta. There are only three shades (Canele, Tuile, and Mousse) that are new (at least, to me), while the others have been released (across various products) in the past. I think the palette is cohesive and easy to create a myriad of pink/plum-themed looks. There was a good mix of shimmers and mattes and depths. For those that don‚Äôt have similar color schemes in their stash, it‚Äôs an affordable, high-quality palette to consider.",A-
COLOUR POP,CHOLA,Lipstick,"a deep burgundy with strong, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied evenly across my lips and didn‚Äôt emphasize my lip lines or lip texture. The liquid lipstick was smooth, thin, and spreadable but didn‚Äôt have a clingy dry down, so it was comfortable to wear. This shade stayed on nicely for over six hours and was neither drying nor hydrating from what I could tell.",A-
COLOUR POP,FLOR,Lipstick,"a rich copper with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. It had rich color payoff that applied evenly in a single, fluid stroke. The texture was lightweight, spreadable, and a little whipped in feel overall. It sank slightly into my lip lines while drying down, though it wasn‚Äôt too noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The color wore well for over six hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
COLOUR POP,CHISME,Highlighter,"a light-medium gold with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It had more semi-sheer, buildable pigmentation, as even with a dense blush brush, it applied with more medium to semi-opaque coverage (as opposed to intense). I also noticed that the texture seemed to be drier as it did not adhere well to my arm (which is significantly drier than my face), and it had a tendency to sheer out when I tried to build it up. Over a moisturized face or cream/liquid base, it applied well and looked lovely on, though (which may be more accurate for most). The highlighter was easy to blend out and did not emphasize my skin‚Äôs natural texture. This shade lasted nicely for eight hours on me before fading noticeably.",A
COLOUR POP,BESAME,Lipstick,"a deep red with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had good color coverage in a single layer‚Äìjust shy of full coverage‚Äìthat applied evenly and fluidly over my lips without streaking or gathering in my lip lines. The liquid lipstick had a lightweight, spreadable texture that was thin but not watery, though it dried down to a soft matte finish. The color was still going strong after six hours of wear, and it felt neither drying nor hydrating at that point.",C+
URBAN DECAY,SHEER BESO,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúsheer mauve-pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark plum with subtle, warm undertones and a soft sheen. It had semi-sheer color coverage that applied fairly evenly over lips and wore for four and a half hours. The formula was lightly hydrating and comfortable to wear. I personally love these types of colors, and one that wears decently but still has that translucency made this one a favorite for me (personally, of course).",A-
URBAN DECAY,SHEER BITTERSWEET,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúsheer, bright red-purple.‚Äù It‚Äôs a lightly brightened, medium fuchsia magenta with cool undertones and a luminous sheen. It had semi-sheer color coverage with a lightly creamy consistency that ‚Äúmelts‚Äù and applies without tugging on the lips. The color could apply a bit more evenly, though the brightness of the shade distracts from some of the unevenness in application. It wore for four hours on me, and it was lightly moisturizing over time.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,BELLINI,Lipstick,"an ‚Äúelectric pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, brightened medium fuchsia pink with subtle, cool undertones and a luminous sheen.",A
COLOUR POP,MR. BLONDE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright true turquoise.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium sky blue with cool undertones and a satin-matte finish. It was mostly matte, but there was an almost vinyl-like sheen to it‚Äìand it took forever to dry down. Even when ‚Äúdry‚Äù after a half hour, there was still a very light tack in places. This shade had intense pigmentation that went on smoothly and evenly, but it had a thicker consistency that ‚Äúcracked‚Äù as soon as I smiled. It felt a bit clingier, and it was prone to flaking from the center of the mouth over time, though the majority of the color was intact after six hours. The formula was somewhat drying overall.",B
COLOUR POP,JELLIES,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúrich cobalt blue.‚Äù It‚Äôs a lightly brightened, medium-dark navy blue with cool undertones and a soft sheen. Like Mr. Blonde, it didn‚Äôt dry down to a flat matte finish, even after waiting for a half hour‚Äìit looked more like vinyl or plastic on. The texture of this one is very runny, and I urge you to keep your tube upright when you‚Äôre using it; I had it slightly angled, and I had blue lipstick spilled everywhere! It had mostly opaque pigmentation, but it was difficult to keep it smooth as it was slightly tacky for an hour of wear, so any time the lips touched within that first hour, there was a risk of the color lifting in places. It wore for seven hours in total, but I had some minor flaking from the center of the mouth.",B
DIOR,EXUBERANTE (766),Palette,"five eyeshadows ranging from pale peach to shimmery, navy blue. It‚Äôs not the worst palette I‚Äôve come across from Dior, but it had that signature miss‚Äìrich blue eyeshadow‚Äìthat really brought down the palette as a whole, though the other four shades were okay but nothing impressive.",C+
SEPHORA,FIJI (25),Blush,"a softened, medium-dark brown with warm undertones and a fine, gold shimmer-sheen.",A-
MAC,VIVA GLAM MILEY CYRUS 2,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúbright orange with sparkle.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, coral-orange with warm undertones and pink and gold sparkle.",A-
GUERLAIN,ORANGE FIZZ,Lipstick,"a brightened, medium-dark orange-red with warm undertones and a satin finish.",A
GUERLAIN,NAHEMA SMACK,Lipgloss,"a brightened, medium orange-coral with warm undertones and a smattering of gold and pink sparkle.",A-
COLOUR POP,SHIMMY,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúpale pastel baby pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a lightly brightened, light-medium pink with neutral-to-warm undertones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque pigmentation that went on fairly evenly with a slightly thicker consistency compared to other shades in the range. I thought it was going to appear ‚Äúcracked,‚Äù but it seemed to smooth out nicely when I smiled. The color lasted for six hours, while the formula was just a bit drying after five hours of wear.",A-
COLOUR POP,SOLOW,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúneutral nude pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and a matte finish. This was one of the least matte shades in the range, though it is still a matte finish to me. It had good pigmentation, but I noticed a very light veil of translucency with this shade. On me, the color wore for six and a half hours with even fading and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
CHANEL,BEIGE STAR (206),Lipgloss,"a pink-tinged beige with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque color payoff, but there‚Äôs a fair amount of translucency so the natural lip color will influence this one a lot. For those with darker natural lip color, this may lighten and brighten to some degree without being particularly noticeable on. It didn‚Äôt settle as much as a lot of shades in this family have for me, but there is still some minor settling into my lower lip lines. It wore for three hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",C+
CHANEL,CHENE ROUGE (212),Lipgloss,"a muted, medium red with warm undertones and orange pearl. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque pigmentationt and covers fairly evenly. I can see this gloss appealing to more, as it isn‚Äôt fully opaque but has enough color to noticeably tint lips. The texture was smooth, lightly tacky overall, and comfortable to wear. This shade wore for four and a half hours on me and was very lightly hydrating.",B+
CHANEL,LA BOULEVERSANTE (51),Lipstick,"a slightly muted, medium red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff with a very smooth, thin consistency. The finish had a fair amount of shine‚Äìmore than ‚Äúvelvet matte‚Äù would have as defined by most would be my guess! Though it‚Äôs not touted as hydrating, it is supposed to be ‚Äúnon-drying‚Äù and long-wearing, but my experience with it was that it was somewhat drying over the five hours it lasted. Something about the consistency made it seem like it didn‚Äôt really adhere to my lips that well.",C
CHANEL,PENSIVE (162),Lipstick,"a light-medium, peachy brown with warm undertones and fine peach pearl. It had sheer coverage that applies unevenly and settles into lip lines right away. It lasted for two hours and was slightly drying.",D+
CHANEL,ALEZANE (260),Blush,a muted coppery-brown with a hint of rose and gold shimmer.,A-
CHANEL,FLEUR DE PIERRE (106),Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark gray with cool undertones and fine blue and silver pearl. Chanel‚Äôs not the first brand to take liberty with the world ‚Äúmatte‚Äù (‚Äúthe best-loved, gel-cream shadow goes matte‚Äù), but this is certainly not matte‚Äìthere is quite a bit of shimmer in this shade. The texture was noticeably drier with a very thin consistency that made blending more difficult, as the color appeared patchy and uneven. It‚Äôs better used at its semi-opaque intensity and then built-up to mostly opaque coverage. It wore for eight hours before creasing slightly.",C
CHANEL,ROUGE-GORGE (116),Eyeshadow,"a brightened pop of tangerine orange with warm, yellow undertones and a fine, light gold pearl. It had semi-sheer color payoff that was slightly buildable, but I couldn‚Äôt achieve full coverage with this product. I think it would work better as a base product or really blended out for a warm wash of color. The texture was mousse-like with light spring but has a thin, blendable feel on the skin that makes it feel more like a powder once applied. The lasting power came in at eight and a half hours before creasing.",B-
KAT VON D,SUSPERIA,Lipstik,"a ‚Äúbright lavender.‚Äù It‚Äôs a lightly brightened, medium-dark purple with warmer pink undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that went on smoothly and evenly, though the texture dried down in such a way that it seemed to emphasize the natural texture of the lips slightly more than other shades in the range. It wore comfortably for five hours, and then it was a bit drying for the next three hours (for a total of eight hours of wear).",A
KAT VON D,BELOVED,Lipstik,"a ‚Äúsoft coral.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and an ultra, flat matte finish. The texture was lightweight, easily spread across the lips, and yielded opaque, even coverage. On me, the color wore well for seven hours before noticeably fading and was slightly drying after six hours.",A
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,NORMAN PARKINSON,Highlighter,"Äúpeaches and cream.‚Äù It‚Äôs a soft, light-medium gold-shimmered peach with warm undertones and a luminous sheen.",A
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,1975 RED,Lipstick,"a brightened, medium-dark orange-red with warm undertones and a satin finish. It‚Äôs not quite matte, though it‚Äôs not particularly shiny, while the texture is creamier, light-to-medium in weight, and glides on with smooth, even, and opaque color coverage. The color lasted for over six hours and was lightly drying after four and a half hours of wear.",A
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,MISS KENSINGTON,Lipstick,"a muted, light-medium rosy beige with subtle, warmer undertones and fine pearl over a semi-matte finish. It‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúfrosted matte‚Äù in a way, but it doesn‚Äôt have shine, just shimmer. The texture has a noticeable texture to it due to the high pearl content, and the texture was firmer than 1975 Red, which made it harder to apply. The texture was thinner and prone to emphasizing lip lines. It wore for three hours on me but was moderately drying.",C
MAC,LAPISLUXE,Palette,"a cooler-toned shades. The three shades coordinate well together, but the Veluxe Pearlfusion is one of those eyeshadows that you may love or easily skip right on by. This formula is supposed to have ‚Äúsheer coverage with a soft finish‚Äù when applied dry and ‚Äúsuper saturation of colour with metallic brilliance‚Äù when applied wet. My experience with this formula is that sometimes it can be really nice, other times it is a total miss. I think they are most practical used damp or over a slightly tacky base if you want to use them dry. They‚Äôre actually longer-wearing than you might think, given how they feel and swatch, but I usually get seven to eight hours of crease-free wear.",C-
BURBERRY,OPTIC WHITE (000),Eyeshadow,"a bright, metallic white with neutral undertones. Applied dry, it was semi-opaque, and applied damp, it was more opaque, though not fully opaque. The texture has an almost dry feel to the touch, but it is very smooth and blendable. It wore well for eight hours on me before creasing slightly.",A-
BURBERRY,TEA ROSE (200),Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium mauve-pink with a pearly shimmer to it. The texture was soft and finely-milled, but it was dusty to work with where the color was very prone to sheering out to near-nothing on the lid without some sort of base for it to cling to. It is supposed to be sheerer, but buildable, applied dry, and then more ‚Äúsaturated‚Äù applied damp; it was semi-opaque applied damp, but I couldn‚Äôt build up the color any more than that. It started to fade after seven hours on me.",C-
BURBERRY,NICKEL (304),Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark gray with silver shimmer that gives it a more frosted finish overall. It was semi-sheer to semi-opaque whether applied dry or damp; it seemed to get a touch darker when applied damp but tended to dry down to a slightly lighter color. The texture was soft to the touch but a little dusty to work with. This shade wore well for seven and a half hours on me.",B-
BURBERRY,ANTIQUE BLUE (305),Eyeshadow,"a deepened, blackened gray with a cool, bluish tinge and a pearl finish. It had semi-opaque, slightly softened color when applied dry, which intensified to opaque coverage with more depth when applied damp. The texture was soft, blendable, and not too dusty to work with, so it was one of the better ones I tried. The color stayed in place for eight hours on me.",B+
BURBERRY,STONE BLUE (307),Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium faded blue with a satin sheen. The texture was on the powdery side, even though it was very soft and blendable, where the powder didn‚Äôt stick well to the skin. It had sheer coverage applied dry, as anticipated, and damp application was only semi-sheer with a more noticeable sheen. It faded within six hours of wear and looked uneven applied.",D
URBAN DECAY,BITTERSWEET,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright purple.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, fuchsia magenta with cool, blue undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque coverage, but I noticed that the texture of the pencil was firmer and didn‚Äôt glide on as easily as other shades. This shade lasted for six hours on its own.",A-
URBAN DECAY,BLACKMAIL,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep berry wine.‚Äù It‚Äôs a berry-burgundy with subtle, cool red undertones and a matte finish. This is probably one of the worst performing shades I‚Äôve tried from the entire range of 24/7 Lip Pencils! It was semi-opaque with streaky, uneven color that tended to ‚Äúthicken‚Äù in places. It may have lasted for eight hours, but it was clingy and somewhat drying over time.",C-
URBAN DECAY,STARK NAKED,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúlight nude.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, yellowed peach with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation with a creamy, glide-on texture that was easy to use and didn‚Äôt tug at the lips. This shade wore well for six hours on its own.",A
ESTEE LAUDER,SHAMELESS VIOLET,Lipstick,"a brightened, medium-dark purple with subtle, warmer pink tones and a satin sheen. It had mostly opaque coverage that applied without dragging, but it could have applied a little more evenly. The color lasted for seven hours on me and was a little hydrating in the beginning but never drying.",A-
ESTEE LAUDER,STRONGER,Lipstick,"aa slightly muted, medium-dark fuchsia-magenta with warmer undertones and a semi-matte finish. The texture of this shade was firmer and thinner compared to the other two shades, though it didn‚Äôt tug at the lips, but the resulting finish was also the closest to true matte. It had mostly opaque covoerage that applied evenly and smoothly, and it wore well for seven hours on me. It was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
MAC,STAR MAGNOLIA,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright carnation pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, light-medium pink with cool, blue undertones and silver and pink frost. It is one of the more frosty (less pearly) shades in the range, and the texture of the shimmer is noticeable when applying the lipstick from the tube. It wore for three hours and was drying on me.",B-
MAC,KOI CORAL,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúpale peachy nude.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, peachy-pink with subtle, warm undertones and a soft sheen. This has some of the least noticeable pearl in it. The texture gravitated towards lip lines, though, and didn‚Äôt apply evenly. It lasted for two and a half hours and was drying.",C-
MAC,NIPPON,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúcreamy mid-tone coral pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, light-medium pink with warm undertones and gold pearl. It had semi-opaque color payoff that applied evenly, and it didn‚Äôt settle too much into lip lines until after thee hours of wear (which was the total length of wear). It was a little drying overall.",B
MAC,PICKLED PLUM,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright blue-pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, fuchsia-pink with cool, blue undertones and faint gold and pink pearl. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque pigmentation that covered the lips with mostly even color, though it pulled into lip lines just slightly. The color lasted for three and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B-
TARTE,ENERGY NOIR,Palette,"a cooler-toned eyeshadow palette with one blush. The palette has some misses and a few nicer shades, but if you already have a few of Tarte‚Äôs palettes, you may want to check your stash‚Äìthere were a lot of Tarte eyeshadows that I ended up pulling as similar shades across this palette. The mattes were on the powdery side, while the more frosted shades were more pigmented and applied better to bare skin.",C+
SEPHORA,ALL BLACK EVERYTHING,Eyeliner,"a ‚Äúmatte black.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium black with a mostly matte finish. It was slightly drier than other shades I tried, and it had semi-opaque coverage in a single stroke. It was buildable to opaque coverage in two layers and lasted for nine hours on me.",B+
SEPHORA,BEAUTIFUL MONSTER,Eyeliner,"a ‚Äúmatte lime green.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, yellowed chartreuse with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It is lightly creamy, so it glides on well without tugging and deposits good pigmentation in a single pass. It wore well for nine hours on me.",A-
SEPHORA,ON WEDNESDAYS WE WEAR PINK,Eyeliner,"a ‚Äúmatte pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, magenta pink with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff in one stroke (which is always impressive) and was just creamy enough to apply without tugging but stayed in place well for ten hours on me. No dupes for this one from my stash that I can recall!",A
SEPHORA,SEA IF I CARE,Eyeliner,"a ‚Äúmatte blue.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium-dark cobalt blue with a semi-matte finish. It had so-so pigmentation in one stroke and was buildable to mostly opaque coverage in two layers. This was slightly less creamy compared to other shades (but creamier than the black shade) but didn‚Äôt tug. It wore well for almost nine and a half hours on me",B+
SEPHORA,SLY LIKE A FOX,Eyeliner,"a ‚Äúmatte terra cotta.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark copper with hints of red and a mostly matte finish. It had nice pigmentation in a single pass, and the texture was lightly creamy for smooth, even application and didn‚Äôt tug on the lash line. On me, the color wore well for nine and a half hours before thinning.",A
BITE BEAUTY,MAPLE,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúbronze shine.‚Äù It‚Äôs a coppery-brown with lighter gold, pink, and copper shimmer.",A
BARE ESCENTUALS,"WORK, WEEKEND, WOW",Palette,"seven eyeshadows from beige to navy blue. There are a few repeats: 500 Thread Count (Permanent, The Dream Sequence), Custom Made (Limited Edition), Rowdy (Permanent, The After Party). It‚Äôs a good palette, though a few shades are on the dupable side. I liked that it leaned a little cooler-toned overall, but I would have preferred more satin/pearl finishes to pair with the mattes rather than the more sparkly/ultra-frosted shades (like Custom Made and Starstruck), as I think they have a thicker/denser consistency that makes them harder to blend with the mattes as a whole.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,BRAISED MAPLE,Lipstick,"a lightly brightened, medium-dark brick red with warm, orange undertones and a glossy sheen. It had rich, opaque coverage with a light-medium thick consistency that went on smoothly and evenly. The color lasted for seven and a half hours, was hydrating, and left a stain behind. Really, the only downside is the fact that isn‚Äôt at all matte.",A
BITE BEAUTY,CANDIED MAPLE,Lipstick,"a brightened, medium orange-red with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It was intensely pigmented with a creamy, glide-on texture that sat well on the lips while keeping them hydrating over the six and a half hours it lasted.",A
BITE BEAUTY,MULLED MAPLE,Lipstick,the same shade as Black Cherry from the U.S.-exclusive Frozen Berries collection,B-
GUERLAIN,SUMMER EDITION (2015),Highlighter,"Äúdelicate pastel colors‚Äù available exclusively at Nordstrom. According to the brand, it uses ‚Äúfresh green‚Äù for anti-redness, fuchsia to revive, ‚Äúsunny yellow‚Äù for anti-dullness, ‚Äúpearlescent white‚Äù to reflect light, champagne to illuminate, and ‚Äúrich coral‚Äù to enhance. The overall effect is supposed to give ‚Äúyour skin in a pure radiant halo of light while covering your skin in a delicate violet scent.‚Äù The back of the container also calls them Rainbow Pearls (rather than Summer Edition), and worth nothing is that they look little like the promotional image.",B+
TOO FACED,YOUR LOVE IS KING,Blush,"Äúplummy rose.‚Äù It‚Äôs a slightly muted, medium-dark pinky-plum with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish.",B-
LORAC,BLACK,Palette,"a mix of darker neutral shades that ranges from a gray-ish beige to a medium-dark black. The quality is decent to good, but the more powdery formula could benefit greatly from an eyeshadow primer/base. A few shades are powdery enough where they don‚Äôt adhere smoothly to the lid or they‚Äôll dust away as you blend them. The wear was decent at seven and a half hours on average, despite no primer. The darker shades were a little firmer and harder to blend, while the lighter shades felt very smooth and finely-milled (but on the powdery side).",B
TOO FACED,JUSTIFY MY LOVE,Blush,"a ‚Äúbright pink with fine gold sparkle.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, bubblegum pink with strong, cool blue undertones and a satin sheen.",B
GIORGIO ARMANI,NO. 09,Blush,"a bold, brightened, fuchsia-red with cool, blue undertones and fine gold, pink, and violet shimmer. This is sheerer than it looks, though it is one of the more buildable shades in the range. It is easiest to get a sheer tint of color (noticeable but still lets a lot of the natural skin color come through), but two to three layers gets you semi-opaque color, if desired. The finish is more satin once applied as the shimmer doesn‚Äôt stand out. I liked applying this prior to foundation and then using foundation to help keep it from being too intense on me, when I wanted to wear it as more of a distinct blush. For a sheerer tint of color, applying on bare skin or over foundation worked just fine with a few pats of the fingertip or a small, stippling brush. The texture was thin, a little watery, and it did seem thinner than the average shade in this range. On me, the color wore for almost ten hours before fading slightly.",A
BECCA COSMETICS,OMBRE ROUGE,Palette,"a set of five, warm-toned neutral eyeshadows with matte and satin finishes. It‚Äôs a nice palette overall, and it‚Äôs not quite as dupable as your typical neutral palette, but there are a fair amount of dupes for each shade. All five shades coordinate well with each other, and I liked that the finishes ranged from matte to satin, so you could get a little more depth out of the combination while also having an easier time blending out the shades.",B+
NARS,CHELSEA GIRLS,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúpink beige.‚Äù It‚Äôs a slighly muted, light-medium pinky-peach with a creamy, glossy finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered the lips evenly, but I found the color to pull into lip lines. It wasn‚Äôt too noticeable from afar, but it did gather more gloss as it wore on. The texture is light-medium in weight, is comfortable to wear with a light tackiness. It stayed on for four hours on me and was hydrating while worn. Several readers mentioned Chelsea Girls Lip Lacquer, but unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have that, so I cannot compare the two!",B
NARS,BABY DOLL,Lipgoss,"a ‚Äúshimmering candy pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a lightly brightened, medium pink with warm undertones and lighte rpink and silver shimmer. It reminds me of strawberry milk but brighter. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque coverage with a high-shine, high-shimmer finish. The gloss had a light-medium weight to it and felt a little thicker than some of NARS‚Äô glosses have in the past, and it seemed to sit in lip lines more with this particular shade. On me, it lasted for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating with light tackiness.",B+
NARS,TRIBULATION,Blush,"Äúshimmery rosy sand.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium gold muted slightly by hints of beige paired with a luminous, shimmer-sheen finish.",A
BITE BEAUTY,ELDERBERRY,Lipstick,"a deepened, burgundy with cool, purple-red undertones and a glossy sheen. It had semi-opaque coverage that applied poorly, as the color was uneven, patchy, and settled into lip lines. The texture had a lot of slip and some weight to it, which is why I think it just migrated to lip lines from the get-go. I had a little feathering after four hours of wear, though the color lasted closer to six and left behind a stain. It was lightly moisturizing over time.",C
BITE BEAUTY,JUNIPER,Lipstick,"a brightened, pinky-red with subtle, warmer undertones and a satin finish. It had rich, opaque color coverage with a light-medium, creamy consistency that covered smoothly and evenly. There was creaminess but not too much slip, so this shade sat well on the lips without sliding around, and it lasted for seven hours without feathering. It was hydrating while worn.",A
BITE BEAUTY,PLUM,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark reddened plum with fine ruby shimmer and a natural finish. It had mostly opaque coverage, but the natural lip color will come through slightly. The finish is definitely not matte, and it had more slip than Juniper but less than Elderberry, so it applied without too much trouble and didn‚Äôt feather when worn. I noticed some color migrated into lip lines after three to four hours of wear, but the slip in the formula made it easy to smooth it back out by pressing and rubbing lips together. The color lasted for six hours overall and was lightly hydrating.",B+
GIORGIO ARMANI,SUN GLOW (90),Bronzer,"a light-medium brown with soft, yellow undertones and a very, very fine golden shimmer-sheen that gives it a more satin finish. It was very pigmented but blendable and easily sheered out if desired. This color doesn‚Äôt show up much on my medium skin tone, so it would be better for fairer complexions or for mixing with foundation to add an all-over glow. It lasted for nine hours on me.",A+
GIORGIO ARMANI,SUN KISS (100),Bronzer,"medium brown with warm, yellow-red undertones and a very fine, golden shimmer that creates a more satin-like finish on the skin. It had rich color coverage in a single drop, and I use about one to two drops per cheek at most (you really don‚Äôt need much at all!). It blended out beautifully and wore for nine hours on me.",A+
GIORGIO ARMANI,SUN BATH (110),Bronzer,"a rich, coppery brown with fine gold shimmer that gives it a satin finish overall. The texture was blendable, thin, and easily sheered out, if desired. It was richly pigmented and a little went a long way. On me, the color wore for almost ten hours before fading slightly.",A+
SLEEK,PIXIE PINK,Blush,"a brightened, light-medium cotton candy pink with strong, blue undertones and a matte finish. The texture was soft and silky with some excess powder kicking up in the pan, but on the skin, the blush didn‚Äôt look powdery, which is where it counts the most. It was richly pigmented, and the silky quality of the powder made it easier to blend on the skin. I noticed it darkened on my skin, though if you are naturally drier, you may find it stays truer to the color in the pan. It wore for eight and a half hours before breaking down.",A
SLEEK,POMEGRANATE,Blush,"a brightened, reddish-plum with cool, pink sheen and warmer, coppery undertones. It was very, very pigmented, so a little went a long way, and I‚Äôd recommend using a feathery brush with this and building up color to your desired intensity. Thankfully, the powder is soft, smooth, and blendable, which will make it easier to diffuse or sheer down the color if you‚Äôve applied to much. It wore for nine hours before fading on me.",A
MAYBELLINE,RICH RUBY,Lipstick,"a slightly muted, medium-dark red with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. It had good pigmentation that covered the lips for the most part, but there is a very light translucency to it overall. The texture was lightweight, velvety, and smooth and applied evenly to the lips. It was really comfortable to wear and wasn‚Äôt drying over the six hours it lasted, and I didn‚Äôt experience feathering or bleeding either.",A
MAYBELLINE,ALL FIRED UP,Lipstick,"a brightened,pinky-red with warmer undertones and a satin finish. It had fairly opaque coverage that went on evenly and smoothly, while it lasted for six and a half hours with a light stain left behind. It was slightly drying after four hours of wear, though. The texture seemed a bit thinner compared to other shades I‚Äôve tried.",A-
MAYBELLINE,PINK SUGAR,Lipstick,"a brightened, light-medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and a semi-matte finish. The texture had a velvety feel to it with light slip but heavier, full coverage. It seemed thicker than other shades in the range, and it emphasized lip lines slightly but didn‚Äôt pull into them too much while worn. The color lasted for four and a half hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
MAYBELLINE,BURGUNDY BLUSH,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, reddish burgundy with warm, brown undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff that went on evenly but had a slightly drier consistency compared to most of the range. The texture was lightweight and slightly drying over time, but I only felt the drying quality kick in after four hours of wear, while the color lasted for closer to six in all.",B
MAYBELLINE,NUDE NUANCE,Lipstick,"a slightly muted, medium-dark brown with hints of warm orange and a semi-matte finish. It had fairly good coverage that went on evenly and smoothly. This shade had one of the more matte finishes within the recent additions, and the color wore for five hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
MAYBELLINE,CLAY CRUSH,Lipstick,"a light-medium, peachy-brown with a semi-matte finish. It had subtler, warmer undertones but it lacks brightness so it ends up appearing less orange-based. The texture was velvety and applied evenly with smooth, mostly opaque color payoff. I had some issues with the color pulling into lip lines after three hours, though it wore for five hours overall.",B+
SMASHBOX,#SHAPEMATTERS,Palette,"a brow wax, two brow powders, four face powders, nine eyeshadows, and a double-ended brush. The palette is neutral-to-warm in tone overall, with the contour powder leaning neutral, almost cool in tone. All of the products in the palette had fairly soft, finely-milled textures that were blendable and easy enough to use. The eyeshadows can be a little powdery to work with when applying without a primer for the powder to adhere to, so that would be my bit of advice when working with them: use a primer, though they are workable on bare skin. The more matte highlight shade may look chalky on medium and darker skin tones, and the more shimmery highlight powder has a strong white base and can be stark when not buffed out.",B+
GIVENCHY,BEIGE PLUMETIS (103),Lipstick,"a light, peachy-beige with warm undertones and a natural shine. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque coverage, but for such a light shade, I was surprised it was really sheer! The texture was smooth when applying, but the lighter color seemed to cling a little more noticeably. On me, it lasted for three hours but settled into lip lines. It was neither hydrating nor drying.",B-
GIVENCHY,ROSE FANTAISIE (202),Lipstick,"a light-medium, cotton candy pink with cool, blue undertones and a soft sheen. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque pigmentation that had a tendency to pull into lip lines, and it looked a little streaky. The color stayed put for two and a half hours, and the color migrated more and more noticeably into lip lines over time.",C+
GIVENCHY,MOKA IMPRIME (304),Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark plum with warm undertones and a soft sheen. It had semi-sheer color coverage that went on fairly evenly, though it could have applied better. The texture was lightweight, a little clingy but not drying. This shade wore for three and a half hours on me.",B
VISEART,PARIS NUDE (06),Palette,"a set of twelve shades, and if you‚Äôve ever longed for a palette of shimmery, mid-tones, this might be the one for you. Viseart‚Äôs philosophy is that the palettes are supposed to be mixed (and their roots are as a professional artistry brand that is gaining attention with its availability at Sephora), though you can certainly achieve looks with this palette alone, but if you like a variety in finish, you‚Äôll need to add in your favorite mattes. The palette leans warm overall with a few shades more neutral-to-warm. The texture is soft and blendable with some shades feeling a little dry, dusty, and/or powdery, but these things didn‚Äôt translate into application, as they still adhered well to bare skin (no primer) and wore for eight hours or longer. I think they perform better in practice than just swatched, in general. I wish the pans were removable so you could create your own palette of finishes, as I do think that for travel, a set of twelve is a good number, but most will want a few darker and/or matte shades in their look.",A-
NYX,BLACK CHERRY TART,Lipgloss,"a blackened purple with warm, berry undertones and a cream finish. Unsurprisingly, the shade applied poorly as it was prone to streaking and pulling into those pesky lip lines. It was only semi-opaque, so the lack of coverage made all those application flaws particularly noticeable. Over a lip liner or lipstick, it could certainly work, but on its own, it is a bit messy. It lasted for four hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B-
NYX,CHOCOLATE CREPE,Lipgloss,"a plummy brown with warm, rosy undertones and a cream finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage that went on evenly and smoothly without drawing much attention to lip lines. The gloss wore well for four hours and wore away evenly while it didn‚Äôt dry or hydrate my lips.",A-
NYX,FUNNEL DELIGHT,Lipgloss,"a brightened, neon light-medium fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a cream finish. It had mostly opaque pigmentation that covered evenly. The gloss seemed a little thinner compared to the other two, but it didn‚Äôt highlight lip lines much‚ÄìI noticed it a little in the close-up photos but not in person. This shade stayed on well for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
DIOR,CONTRASTE HORIZON (556),Palette,"a brighter, more colorful set of shades for summer. You know me, despite having a fairly consistent negative experience with Dior‚Äôs palettes these days, that bluish-teal color drew me in, and shortly after receiving my order, I deeply regretted purchasing. The texture of the eyeshadows is drier overall, and they just performed poorly as far as wear and application went without some sort of helper (base or primer).",C-
MAC,SHE SPARKLES,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúlight grey with silver sparkles.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, light-medium pewter with warm, beige tones paired with a sparkling, metallic finish. This was one of the better shades in the collection, as it had a stronger base color and less sparkle, which resulted in stronger color payoff, better application, and less fall out. It wore well for seven hours before creasing (worn dry), eight hours (worn damp), ten hours (with adhesive primer).",B+
MAC,BOOM BOOM ROOM,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúlight burgundy with emerald sparkles.‚Äù It‚Äôs a reddish-burgundy with warm, coppery undertones paired with fine green shimmer that shifts from copper-brown to bluish-teal. It had semi-sheer coverage applied dry, which amplified to semi-opaque applied damp, but it is a very sparkly shade, so the fall out during wear was noticeable. It lasted for six hours (worn dry), seven hours (worn damp), ten hours (with adhesive primer).",C
MAC,FEEL THE FEVER,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúdeep blue purple with pink sparkles.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, purply taupe with cooler undertones and multi-colored shimmer and sparkle, primarily blue and pink. It had the same color coverage applied dry as it did damp, which was mostly opaque. The texture was lightly emollient with good glide and adhesion, but it adheres better damp as it goes on smoother and the sparkles seem to bind better with the underlying color. There was a fair amount of fall out after six hours when worn dry, a little less fall out when worn damp where it lasted for closer to seven hours. I had minor fall out and longer wear (ten hours) when applied over a glitter adhesive.",B-
MAC,SAY IT ISN'T SO,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúdark grey with pink sparkles.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark gray with silver and pink sparkle over a metallic finish. It was very sparkly, so applied dry, it was less pigmented and more prone to fall out during wear and creased within six hours. Applied damp, it was easier to work with, as it adhered better and lasted a little longer (seven hours) with fall out but not as much as dry application. It wore for ten hours over a glitter adhesive with minimal fall out.",C
MAC,GET PHYSICAL,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúpurple with light blue sparkles.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark purple with warmer, plummy undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. Applied dry, it was semi-sheer, and applied damp, it was mostly opaque. I had some fall out by the end of six hours when I wore it dry, and then slightly less but still noticeable fall out after seven hours when I wore it damp. Over a glitter adhesive, it lasted closer to ten hours with minimal fall out.",C
LORAC,BEIGE HIGHLIGHT,Palette,"three highlighters and three contouring powders. Five of the powders are matte, while one of the highlighters is frosted. The shimmery highlighter and medium contour powder are larger than the other four shades. It comes in a slim, cardboard packaging like the rest of the Pro palette range, plus a contouring brush, which is a nice, synthetic brush that doesn‚Äôt feel scratchy and blends fairly well. It seems to pick up a lot of product, even with a light hand, so those who prefer a subtler contour may want to choose another brush, while it doesn‚Äôt work as well for highlight placement. The powders are supposed to be ‚Äúultra-pigmented‚Äù and ‚Äúblendable.‚Äù The texture of all of the powders is comparable to LORAC‚Äôs spring blush palette as well as their eyeshadows: very silky, finely-milled, and smooth but kicks up excess powder easily, so it can seem powdery.",A-
ROUGE BUNNY ROUGE,GODDESS,Highlighter,"a ‚Äúmedium, rosy amber with a golden glow.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, golden brown with a golden shimmer-sheen finish.",A-
MAYBELLINE,NUDE EMBRACE,Lipstick,"a light-medium beige with strong, warm brown tones and a satin finish. It had good color payoff with a creamy consistency, so there was no drag when applied, but the color migrated into lip lines during initial application. Despite trying to smooth the color out of the lines, as it wore on, the color kept gravitating towards the lip lines. It wore for four and a half hours in all and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B
MAYBELLINE,DARINGLY NUDE,Lipstick,"a peachy-pink with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had fairly opaque pigmentation that covered evenly, but again, the color had a tendency to emphasize lip lines. It wasn‚Äôt as noticeable as it was with Nude Embrace, at least. On me, the color lasted for four and a half hours with more color settling into lip lines over time, though it wasn‚Äôt drying.",B
MAYBELLINE,TOUCH OF SPICE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark rosy plum with subtle, warmer undertones and a satin finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that covered evenly and smoothly. The texture was creamy, and it was much more forgiving on the lips. It wore well for five and a half hours, and I didn‚Äôt have any issues with the color pulling into lip lines. It wasn‚Äôt drying when worn.",A-
URBAN DECAY,NAKED SMOKY,Palette,"a set of cooler-toned shades ranging from beige to black with a definite slant towards grayish tones. The eyeshadows are arranged by finish from most shimmery to least shimmery. The formula feels different than previous Urban Decay releases; it feels noticeably drier and almost chalky to me, especially in the more satin/matte shades, and the press feels firmer. In a way, they remind me of the dryness I felt in the holiday palettes of last year, but the firmer press resulted in less excess powder kicked up all over the place when used and less fall out during application. They almost feel more like Too Faced or LORAC eyeshadows, though LORAC has a silkier feel overall. This texture made it particularly difficult to use them without primer, and I‚Äôve been able to use the prior releases reasonably well (some better than others) without primer (and in general, I can do so with the majority of Urban Decay‚Äôs eyeshadows from the permanent line). For summer, the brand added several new brightly-colored eyeshadows that I was easily able to use without primer (see this post), but this was not workable on bare skin. The texture of these is nothing like the individual shades launched for summer and don‚Äôt really feel like any past iteration of their formula. Whether or not it is accurate, the texture and performance feels like a cheapening of the Urban Decay eyeshadow formula on the whole but at the very least, I‚Äôve lost a lot of faith in their ability to put together a high-quality, high-value palette based on the recent palette releases.",B-
MAKEUP GEEK,SHORE THING,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äútrue pastel, mint green with a matte finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, aqua green with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had decent pigmentation, but the texture was powdery to work with and tended to look almost chalky against my skin. With a primer, it would work better, but it doesn‚Äôt apply well on bare skin‚Äìsheer, uneven, and dry-looking. On bare skin, it lasted for six hours before fading.",D+
MAKEUP GEEK,POPPY,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúmatte orange with subtle pink undertones.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium-dark orange with warm, reddish undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had good color payoff with a soft, blendable texture that was slightly powdery, so it is best patted onto the skin with minimal blending along the edges or else it can sheer out a bit. On me, it lasted for eight hours before fading.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,RAPUNZEL,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúlight peachy champagne with a metallic finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, light-medium yellow gold with a frosted sheen. It had a really soft, smooth texture that wasn‚Äôt powdery, and the color payoff was fully opaque. It wore well for eight hours before fading.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,WISTERIA,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúmatte pale purple.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, cool-toned lavender purple with a satin finish. It had decent color payoff but was on the powdery side. It tended to sheer out and apply unevenly over bare skin, so it was hard to work with. I could only see using this over a more opaque, lightly tacky base to help overcome its issues. It started to fade after six and a half hours of wear. This is supposed to be the new and improved version (for 2015), and it seems better than the original, but it still has its problems.",C
MAKEUP GEEK,ROULETTE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúrosy, burnt sienna with a shimmery finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a rich coppery brown with warm, orange undertones and a metallic finish. The color payoff was incredibly intense and opaque with a smooth, buttery consistency that made it easy to apply and blend out. It wore well for nine hours before fading. This shade was previously available in the Vegas Lights palette but is now part of the permanent line (and available individually).",A+
MAKEUP GEEK,DESERT SANDS,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúmedium camel brown with warm yellow undertones and a matte finish.‚Äù (It was originally described as a ‚Äúmedium terracotta matte.‚Äù) It‚Äôs a medium-dark, yellowed brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. This shade was originally released in the Vegas Lights palette, but it is now available individually (and permanently). The texture is incredibly soft, smooth, and silky without being powdery (one of the brand‚Äôs best matte eyeshadows). It lasted well for nine hours before fading.",A+
MAKEUP GEEK,BABY FACE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúvery light brown with cool gray undertones and a matte finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, neutral beige with a matte finish. It had mostly opaque coverage with a soft, silky texture that was a tiny bit powdery. It lasted for seven and a half hours on me.",B+
CLE DE PEAU,SATIN MOON (305),Palette,"a smokier, medium to dark set of neutral shades, which still leans warm-toned, though it isn‚Äôt as overtly warm-toned as a few of the other quads. Unfortunately, this quad had one of the more disappointing eyeshadows that I‚Äôve tried from the entire quad range, as it was drier, a little powdery, and harder to blend on the skin. The color combination comes together particularly well, and there‚Äôs enough contrast to create a few layered, neutral looks with a smoky edge, so it‚Äôs a shame that it didn‚Äôt perform better.",B
ESTEE LAUDER,DESIRABLE,Lipstick,"a muted, light-medium pinky with a creamy, natural finish and neutral-to-warm undertones. It had mostly opaque pigmentation that covered the lips evenly, but the slightly thickened formula pulled into lip lines. The effect worsened slightly as it wore on for the next five hours. The formula was hydrating.",B+
ESTEE LAUDER,CONFIDENT,Lipstick,"a brightened, medium-dark berry with cool, pink undertones with a soft shine. It had mostly opaque pigmentation with a veil of translucency (you can see my lip freckle just slightly). It covered evenly and smoothly, while it lasted for six and a half hours and left a stain behind. It was comfortable to wear and moisturizing over time.",A
LAURA GELLER,GILDED HONEY,Highlighter,"a brightened, light-medium yellow gold with a luminous sheen.",B+
CLE DE PEAU,CHAMPAGNE SUPERNOVA (304),Palette,"an interesting mix of lighter, spring-y shades that aren‚Äôt quite pastel, but they‚Äôre not brights either. This quad seemed very shimmery, almost metallic, at times, and I would have loved to see one darker, more contrasting shade instead of one of the lighter shades (perhaps the gold). I had minor, but noticeable, fall out with two of the four shades, which was disappointing. I think a primer would help kick this one up a notch more so than some of the other variations I‚Äôve tried.",B+
KAT VON D,A-GO-GO,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright orange-red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, brightened, neon orange with warm, red undertones and an ultra-matte finish. It‚Äôs insanely bright, and it seemed to make my entire face appear warmer/redder. It‚Äôs also intensely pigmented with little product needed for full coverage. The texture begins as a liquid and then dries down to a completely matte finish that doesn‚Äôt really budge until broken down by oil. There‚Äôs just enough time to apply and smooth out the color before it dries down. It was still going strong after eight hours, but it is somewhat drying over time.",A
KAT VON D,JEFFREE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúhot pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium pink with warm undertones and an ultra-matte finish. It had good color coverage, and the texture applied with even, smooth color, but it seemed to dry down more ‚Äúharshly‚Äù in a sense, as it emphasized the texture of my lips, while most shades in this formula have made my lips appear smoother. It was still mostly intact after eight hours of wear, and it started to feel drying after four hours of wear.",A-
KAT VON D,OUTLAW,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbrick red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium-dark red with subtle, neutral-to-warm undertones and an ultra-matte finish. It had rich color payoff that went on smoothly and evenly without a fuss. It dries down quickly but you have enough time to work with the product to get clean, crisp lines. The color was still going strong after eight hours, but it began to feel drying after four and a half hours of wear.",A
ESTEE LAUDER,BLOSSOM BRIGHT,Lipstick,"brightened, medium-dark pink-coral with warm undertones and a creamy, lightly glossy finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage with a veil of translucency. The color wore well for almost six hours, and it was nicely hydrating over time.",A
ESTEE LAUDER,CHARMED,Lipstick,"a muted, light-medium pink-coral with a very subtle gold pearl and luminous finish. It had semi-opaque coverage that covered fairly evenly and smoothly. The color stayed on well for four and a half hours, and the formula felt hydrating while worn.",B+
ESTEE LAUDER,INSPIRING,Lipstick,"a slightly muted, medium-dark pink-plum with subtle, warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque coverage that went on evenly and smoothly. This shade seemed to be true to the ‚Äúmedium coverage‚Äù part of the formula, but it is buildable to slightly more opaque color if desired. It lasted for five hours and was moderately hydrating over time.",A
ESTEE LAUDER,INTRIGUING,Lipstick,"medium-dark, plum-berry with fine violet pearl and a soft shine. This shade was less glossy compared to the other three. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that went on evenly for the most part, but more surprisingly, the color really didn‚Äôt pull into lip lines; there‚Äôs enough tackiness and thickness to the formula that seems to minimize the chance of this happening. It wore well for five hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",A
COLOUR POP,MONDAYS IN MALIBU,Palette,"a set of six cream eyeshadows that range from gilded bronze to warm green to red-brown. The set is limited edition, and the shades aren‚Äôt available individually. Overall, it was high-performer set of shades, and they worked well together. The set does run on on the shimmery side, so if you prefer more matte shades, then this might not be a good fit for you. I did notice that a few of these are similar to other shades from the brand, so you may want to check your stash.",A
COLOUR POP,SMOKIN' WHISTLES,Highlighter,"a ‚Äúcool-toned pink champagne with silver highlights.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light beige with a hint of pink and a metallic sheen. I think on cooler-toned skin with stronger pink undertones, this will actually look more pink-based. It‚Äôs only when I look at it against more distinctively warm-toned shades side-by-side that the pink comes through against my undertones. It had excellent color payoff that was easily sheered out if desired. This is one of the more metallic finishes in the range, but it didn‚Äôt emphasize pores (I was really surprised). It is a strong sheen, so it may not be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea. It lasted for eight hours on me.",A
COLOUR POP,STOLE THE SHOW,Highlighter,"a ‚Äúlight cool-toned gold with luminous flashes of pink, silver, and gold.‚Äù It‚Äôs a cool-toned white with a light gold shimmer-sheen finish with pink and gold sparkle. This shade had a more noticeably sparkly finish, so there was some visible sparkle applied, but I didn‚Äôt notice actual emphasis of pores or the skin‚Äôs natural texture. The texture was a little drier compared to most shades in the line-up, though it was still lightly creamy and applied easily to the skin without being difficult to blend. It lasted for eight hours on me before fading.",A-
MAC,RUNWAY HIT,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúlight nude matte [with a Retro Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, light-medium pink-coral with a matte finish. The texture is dry and very firm, which makes it harder to apply from the tube as it tugs and drags along the lips. The Retro Matte formula is one best applied with a lip brush to minimize irritating the lips. It had mostly opaque coverage, and it lasted for five hours but the color pulled into lip lines somewhat. The formula was drying over time, which is my typical experience with the Retro Matte finish.",C+
MAC,INSTIGATOR,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep blackened plum [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a blackened, purpled wine with berry-pink undertones that leans slightly cool and has a satiny sheen. It had semi-opaque color coverage, but it has a little more slip to it that makes it look somewhat patchy. It‚Äôs not the worst offender for this shade family, but I would recommend wearing a lip liner underneath to minimize unevenness. It lasted for six hours and left a stain behind, but it was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
MAC,ANTIQUE VELVET,Lipstick,"an ‚Äúintense brown [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, dark chocolate brown with warm, mahogany undertones and a satin sheen. It had mostly opaque coverage, which went on fairly evenly, though it wasn‚Äôt quite as smooth or as even as a lot of the other matte shades in this launch. It lasted for five hours and was a smidgen drying.",A-
COLOUR POP,FLIPPER,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúsoft tangerine sprinkled with silver and pink glitter in a metallic finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, golden orange with warm, yellow undertones and silver and pink glitter. The texture has a very smooth, emollient feel to it, though it tended to thicken when applied to the lid unless applied as a sheer wash of color. I didn‚Äôt notice more than a few stray sparkles when I was working with it during application, and then there were a few more that fell during wear, but it was negligible. The underlying color still looked the same nine hours later.",B
COLOUR POP,NILLIONAIRE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúwarm bronze with a ton of gold and multi-coloured glitter in a metallic finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, bronzy brown with khaki undertones and copper and pink glitter over a metallic finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff with a smooth, lightly creamy consistency that was move around, but the larger glitters seemed to turn the base a little patchy as they moved against the base color. This one seemed to be more prone to having sparkle fall out during application, though once I was done, I only saw two or three sparkles drop during the ten hour wear time.",B
COLOUR POP,SHARK ATTACK,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúmid-tone warm coral with gold duochrome finish in a pearlized finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, pink-leaning coral with a fine, golden sheen. It had good color payoff with a lightly emollient texture that seemed like it would apply really well, but I struggled a lot with this. It swatched so nicely, but it was difficult to apply as smoothly and as evenly on the lid. It seemed like if you have really, really smooth, taut eyelids, it might go on more smoothly, but it always looked a little patchy on me. I tried applying in five separate times with fingertips and various brushes. A flat, synthetic brush still seemed to work the best for me, and it applied better to the outer third of my lid than the inner or middle of my lid. It lasted for nine hours before fading. I was surprised as I have had the best luck with the pearlized finishes in the range.",B
COLOUR POP,PLUNGE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúlight warm beige with a golden sheen in a pearlized finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, golden beige with warm undertones and a frosted sheen. It had fairly good pigmentation with a lightly creamy, blendable texture that deposited color evenly and smoothly. I had no trouble with this one, and it was so easy to use. The color lasted for nine and a half hours without creasing or fading.",A
COLOUR POP,HIGH TIDE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúpale champagne gold in a pearlized finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light gold with warm undertones and a soft, frosted finish. It appears lighter applied, as it has a fairly reflective finish. The texture was blendable, lightly creamy, and adhered well to the skin. It had nice pigmentation and lasted for nine and a half hours.",A
SEPHORA,ROSE PETAL (05),Lipgloss,"a muted, medium, neutral-to-warm-toned pink with a cream finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage that covered evenly but had some noticeable settling into lip lines. The glossy finish distracts from it overall, but it is an issue. On me, this shade lasted for three and a half hours and was hydrating.",B
SEPHORA,DEEP ROSE (06),Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark pink-plum with cool undertones and fine gold shimmer. It had semi-opaque color payoff that went on evenly and looked fairly smooth. The shimmer is noticeable but doesn‚Äôt turn the gloss frosted or metallic, so if you aren‚Äôt a big fan of shimmer, you may still like it. It wore well for four and a half hours and was hydrating over time.",A-
SEPHORA,FRESH PEACH (07),Lipgloss,"a coral-pink with warm undertones and a lot of lighter golden peach shimmer. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque pigmentation as the base color blends with the natural lip color a lot, but the shimmer is very noticeable. The shimmer is incredibly fine, so I never felt the texture of it, even as the gloss wore down. It lasted for four hours and was moisturizing.",B+
MAC,STUDDED KISS,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdark oxblood red [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, red-burgundy with a fairly matte finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage, but there was a smidgen of the natural lip color coming through. On me, it lasted for six hours with a bit of feathering after five hours, and it was very slightly drying. This shade has been released previously.",A-
MAC,D FOR DANGER,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbrick red [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, berry-red with cool, pink undertones and a matte finish. It had good color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly as the consistency was lightly creamy without being too thick. It wore well for six hours (and definitely could have lasted longer) and left behind a strong stain after removing. I found it a touch drying overall.",A
MAC,RUBY WOO,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúvery matte vivid blue red [with a Retro Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium-dark red with strong, cool blue undertones and a matte finish. The texture is extremely dry and stiff, which makes it harder to apply as it really pulls at the lips. It was intensely pigmented, but it really takes a lot of effort to get it on. Once on, it lasts for hours and hours and leaves a stain behind, though it is quite drying for me. This shade has been part of the permanent range for years.",B-
MAC,ALL FIRED UP,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright fuchsia matte[with a Retro Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium-dark fuchsia with very, very subtle blue undertones and a matte finish. It had rich color payoff that covers evenly, but it is on the drier side so it can drag. The color holds on for dear life‚Äìeasily still intact after six hours of wear‚Äìbut is drying. This shade was previously released.",B+
MAC,DANGEROUS,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúorangey red matte[with a Retro Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, orange-red with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that went on evenly with slight drag but was creamier than the other Retro Mattes in this post. Again, the color wears like iron and is still going strong after six hours, but it is drying over time. This shade was previously released.",A-
COLOUR POP,BOBA,Blush,"a ‚Äúmid-tone true pink with golden highlights.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, cool-toned pink with lighter gold shimmer. Applied, the finish looks more like a luminous sheen than a frosted or overtly shimmery highlighter. This shade is more like a highlighting blush, as it gives color as well as highlights the skin. The texture was smooth, lightly creamy, and very blendable. On me, it wore well for eight hours before fading.",A
COLOUR POP,LUNCH MONEY,Highlighter,"a ‚Äúsoft light gold with a reflective golden duochrome finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, golden beige with a frosted sheen and warm undertones. It had good color payoff that yielded full coverage applied with fingertips, but the lightly creamy, emollient consistency blended out well so it could be sheered out with fingertips or applied sheer from the get-go with a brush. The finish may seem frosted in a swatch, but on the skin, it‚Äôs a luminous glow that doesn‚Äôt emphasize pores, but it does have very slight sparkle that is sometimes visible (depends on the angle), though it doesn‚Äôt seem to migrate. It lasted for eight hours on me.",A
ESTEE LAUDER,AMBITIOUS PINK,Lipstick,"a brightened, subtly warm-toned, light-medium pink with a soft shine. It had rich, opaque color coverage that applied smoothly and evenly, while the texture and formula made the lips look smoother and plumper. The color wore well for five hours and was hydrating over time. ",A
ESTEE LAUDER,THRILLING,Lipstick,"a reddish-berry with subtle, cool undertones and a soft sheen. It had mostly opaque color coverage, but there was a slight translucency to the shade that allowed the natural lip color to come through. It wore well for five hours and was hydrating over time.",A-
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,THE DOLCE VITA,Palette,"set of warm-toned, neutral shades that lean more red and copper. It‚Äôs a fairly good set of eyeshadows that runs on the shimmery side, but it wears well, is easy to apply, and had good pigmentation overall. Personally, I think that one of the browns could have been substituted for something very dark or more mid-tone, which would give it more versatility.",A-
DIOR,JARDIN (456),Palette,"one of the more recently released quints, and it is part of the permanent range as far as I know. I picked it up awhile ago when I initially was trying out the new range, and it seemed promising when swatched, but there‚Äôs a dryness to the formula that can make it difficult to blend and apply on bare skin. Over primer, it‚Äôs easier to work with, but it‚Äôs still not a formula I‚Äôd reach for or would feel comfortable recommending. As they have a drier, dusty kind of texture, they tend to sheer out on the skin or look dry and fade more quickly.",B
COLOUR POP,FRUIT STAND,Blush,"a ‚Äúneon red orange in a matte finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium-dark coral-red with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage applied with fingertips, in line with the formula‚Äôs description, while brush application gave you better control and sheerer coverage so it could be built up or sheered out, depending on your needs. The texture was smooth but slightly drier, but it blends out fairly easily on the skin. On my normal-to-dry skin, it lasted for nine hours.",A-
COLOUR POP,FOX,Blush,"a ‚Äúmid-tone warm coral in a satin finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium pink with warm undertones and fine silver shimmer. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque coverage, but it was one of the sheerer blushes in the range, and it took three to four layers to get opaque coverage out of it (even with fingertip application!). The finish looks more sparkly in the pan or heavily swatched, but once blended on the skin, it translated to more of a soft sheen. It lasted for seven and a half hours on me.",C
COLOUR POP,TONIC,Blush,"a ‚Äúbright neon orange in a matte finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, brightened medium-dark orange with warm, red undertones. There‚Äôs almost a hint of a golden sheen, but it doesn‚Äôt translate as visible shimmer on the skin; it‚Äôs like a natural matte, where the skin doesn‚Äôt lose luminosity but doesn‚Äôt look shimmery either. It was intensely pigmented, and a little goes a very long way when working with this product, so I preferred using a duo-fiber stippling brush with this to get semi-sheer color coverage that was blendable and buildable based on the look. It wore well for nine and a half hours.",A
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,ES VEDRA,Blush,"a ‚Äúmystic sunset coral.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium-dark coral-red with gold shimmer. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque color coverage. It lasted for six hours as a blush, four hours as a lip product (lightly drying but not as drying as it looked).",C
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,FORMENTERA,Blush,"Äúsun-kissed berry.‚Äù It‚Äôs a subdued, medium-dark brown with hints of rose and a soft sheen. This was one of the less shimmery shades in the range, and it had a more emollient consistency, which helped it look better on the lips but minimized its wear time‚Äìfive hours on the cheeks, three hours on the lips (lightly drying)",C+
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,IBIZA,Blush,"Äúburnished bronze.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, rich bronze with warm, golden yellow undertones and light gold shimmer. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque color payoff that lasted for six hours on cheeks, four hours on lips (lightly drying).",B-
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,LAS SALINAS,Blush,"Äúcandy, fresh, pretty pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, light-medium pink with cool undertones and warmer gold shimmer. It had sheer to semi-sheer color payoff and was one of the more difficult ones to build-up and too many layers made it look incredibly splotchy, so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this for medium or deeper skin tones looking to wear it as a cheek color. As a blush, it lasted for four and a half hours, and as a lip product, it lasted four hours but was moderately drying.",D+
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,MOON BEACH,Blush,"Äúrose gold, iridescent peach.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, gold-shimmered orange with a hint of red in its undertone. It had sheer to semi-sheer color payoff that is really more of a highlighter on my medium skin tone, so this is another shade better as a blush shade for fair skin tones but can still work as a highlighter on other skin tones. The color had turned patchy after four and a half hours of wear on cheeks and two and a half hours on lips but settled significantly and was drying",D
LE METIER DE BEAUTE,OBSIDIAN ODYSSEY,Palette,"five shades for eyes in shades of black, navy blue, warm pink, copper, and golden brown. The True Color Eyeshadow is a wet/dry formulation (at least, this is what it used to be touted as; current descriptions are less helpful), including the mattes (they don‚Äôt harden if you use water with them). According to the brand, matte and shimmer finishes are supposed to have full coverage, while satin finishes are supposed to have sheer coverage (but no specificity regarding wet/dry). There are a lot of Le Metier‚Äôs eyeshadows that I love, and I often like how they pair colors in their Kaleidoscopes, but unless every single shade knocks it out of the park, the price is difficult to justify, which is the case here. Two of the five shades are excellent, while two are middling, and one is particularly disappointing.",B+
CHANEL,VERA (420),Lipstick,"a ‚Äúlight pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium pink with warm undertones and fine, gold shimmer. It had semi-sheer color payoff that covered the lips fairly evenly. On me, the color only wore for two hours, and it was neither hydrating nor drying.",C-
CHANEL,ROUSSY (426),Lipstick,"a ‚Äúsoft raspberry pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium pink with very subtle warm undertones and a lightly luminous finish. It had mostly opaque pigmentation that went on smoothly and evenly for the most part. It lasted for four hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",B+
CHANEL,LEGENDE (428),Lipstick,"an ‚Äúintense satin pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, muted pink-coral with warm, rosy red tones and lighter pinkish-white shimmer that gives it a more frosted finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff that went on evenly and smoothly. The color wore well for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
BY TERRY,BARE BALM (1),Lipstick,"a very light, pale pinkish-white with light shine and cool undertones. It had semi-sheer color coverage that applied somewhat evenly. Though the formula is supposed to help fill in fine lines, it seemed weakest in that aspect, and the very light color of this shade settled into lip lines as it wore. On me, this shade lasted for two and a half hours.",B
BY TERRY,INNOCENT KISS (2),Lipstick,"a soft, peach with a hint of pink and lighter beige shimmer. It had semi-sheer color payoff with noticeable translucency, so if your natural lip colors are darker, you may find this looks a bit different. It applied evenly and smoothly, and it wore well for three hours with very minor settling into lip lines.",B+
BY TERRY,NUDE PULP (3),Lipstick,"a muted, light-medium pink with warm undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. This shade yielded semi-sheer color coverage that was very even and smooth‚Äìit looked like a stain but still had the balm-like shine. It lasted for two hours on me, which was the major downside, but the slightly thinner consistency (compared to other shades) kept it from having color that settled into lip lines.",B+
BY TERRY,SHEER GLOW (4),Lipstick,"a peachy-orange with warm, yellow undertones and a very fine dusting of gold pearl. It had sheer color coverage‚Äìthe least pigmented of the five‚Äìwith a glossy finish and comfortable, hydrating wear. On me, it lasted for two hours and tended to sit in lines.",C+
BY TERRY,FLUSH CONTOUR (5),Lipstick,"a medium-dark brown with warm, copper-red undertones and a light shine. It had semi-sheer pigmentation that went on fairly evenly and smoothly. The formula was comfortable to wear, moderately hydrating, while the color wore for three hours.",B
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,BETTE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúrich, burnished, amber-gold.‚Äù it‚Äôs a medium-dark, golden bronze with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic shimmer-sheen finish. It was intensely pigmented with a creamy, blendable texture that applied evenly and smoothly to the lid. It could easily be worn as an opaque layer of product or sheered out as a wash. I could see very faint signs of creasing after four hours of wear that got a tiny bit worse after a full eight hours, but it was surprising how well it held up despite the early-on creasing. Applied only on the lid, it wore for eight hours without issue (effectively, no creases to settle into!)",B
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,CLEOPATRA,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúvibrant peacock.‚Äù It‚Äôs a rich, blackened teal with lighter emerald green and bluish-teal shimmer that gives it a more metallic finish when applied at full opacity. It has a more pearly sheen when applied as a sheerer, thinner layer of product. It was richly pigmented, and a little goes a very long way, but it started to crease after four hours of wear and worsened as time went, though the creasing was always faint to light.",B
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,MARIE ANTOINETTE,Eyeshadow,"an ‚Äúantique oyster gold.‚Äù It‚Äôs a coppery bronze with warm, reddish undertones and a metallic sheen. It had fairly good color payoff with a creamy, blendable consistency that was particularly prone to creasing while drying down. Even when trying to control and prevent that initial creasing, I still had very faint creasing begin after three and a half hours of wear, which got a little worse by the eight-hour mark but except for a very fine line of separation in my crease, the color hadn‚Äôt faded or smudged.",B-
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,MONA LISA,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúwisteria-chocolate bronze.‚Äù It‚Äôs a dark, chocolate brown with warm, plum and bronze shimmer with a slightly red, plummy tone to it. It looks rather brown in the pot and swatched, but as it is diffused and sheered out, it has a reddish tone to it. The pigmentation is off-the-charts, and you need so little product to get really opaque coverage out of it. This one seemed to dry down slightly faster than other shades, but again, there was very faint creasing noticeable by the four-hour mark, and then it got only a little worse over time.",B
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,NORMA JEAN,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúsparkling-pink champagne.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, golden beige with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. It had rich color payoff that applies evenly and smoothly at full intensity, if desired. The finish becomes more sparkly and less pearly when applied as a sheerer wash of color. The drying time on this one seemed slightly longer than the average on these, which meant it was very prone to creasing while it was drying down. I tried to keep my eyes closed while it was drying and tried to pat it into place to minimize that initial creasing (which should be unnecessary!), and when I was successful, there was still that faint line of creasing after four hours of wear. That faint line got slightly worse as the day wore on. When I used it as a brow bone highlighter, it lasted for eight hours without fading or breaking down.",B-
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,VERUSCHKA,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúminky-mossy golden grey-green.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, muted olive green with warm, bronze and antique gold sparkle and shimmer. It had a little more slip than other shades, which made it apply with less intensity in a single layer, though it was buildable to fully opaque color. I had faint creasing within four hours of wear, which slowly worsened over time",C+
COLOUR POP,TEASECAKE,Highlighter,a ‚Äúpale pink with gold and pink duo chrome finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a lightly pink-toned peach with soft beige that gives it a more toned down look paired with pearly shimmer that from gold to pink.,A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,405P PEARLY PLUM,Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark reddish plum with warm undertones and lighter pink and white shimmer. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that went on evenly and smoothly. The texture is moderately tacky with noticeable thickness, though it isn‚Äôt goopy, and the gloss lasted for five hours and was hydrating over time.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,502P BEETLE,Lipgloss,"a black-based gloss with fine green, blue, and teal micro-shimmer. Swatched on the skin, it appears like a bluish-teal packed with shimmer. Swatched on the lips, the semi-sheer color payoff means the black base comes thorugh quite a bit, which leaves it looking more like an uneven, purplish-black with multi-colored shimmer. I think it looks more interesting in person than in swatches, but it is a lot less complex applied than it appears in the tube or even just swatched on the skin. I think a more opaque, deeper base would go a long way, as this shade would be better layered than a lone, due to its uneven application. On me, the gloss stayed put for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",C
MAKE UP FOR EVER,503 BLACK,Lipgloss,"a neutral, black cream. It is, unfortunately, semi-sheer to semi-opaque with a noticeably thick texture that goes on and feels somewhat goopy. It doesn‚Äôt apply evenly, and it looks patchy while settling into every lip line. On me, it wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating. This is yet another gloss that would is only workable layered over something with better coverage, and it continues to miss the mark of vivid color.",C-
MAC,WARM WASH,Palette,"a warm-toned set of shades that range from golden beige to copper. This eyeshadow formula is supposed to give ‚Äúsheer coverage with a soft finish‚Äù when applied dry and ‚Äúsuper saturation of colour with metallic brilliance‚Äù when applied wet. My experience with this formula is that sometimes it can be really nice, other times it is a total miss. I think they are most practical used damp or over a slightly tacky base if you want to use them dry. They‚Äôre actually longer-wearing than you might think, given how they feel and swatch, but I usually get seven to eight hours of crease-free wear. The other thing I‚Äôve noticed with the Veluxe Pearlfusion palettes has been an inclination to repeat shades (either intentionally or they just have ended up very similar to a previously release).",C+
MAC,DOMESTIC DIVA,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúfrosty watery pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, warm-toned pink with a lot of multi-colored, fine shimmer. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque coverage that went on evenly and smoothly. This shade wore well for almost five hours on me and was neither hydrating nor drying.",A-
MAC,GIRL ON BOARD,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúlight creme nude.‚Äù It‚Äôs a very light, warm-toned beige with white pearly shimmer over a more cream-like finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered evenly but settled noticeably into lip lines. The gloss lasted for four and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B
MAC,HOT/COLD,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äútrue red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a cool-toned, medium-dark pinky-red with a cream finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage (you can still see a hint of my lip freckle) that covered evenly and didn‚Äôt pull into lip lines. The gloss stayed on well for six hours, but I had very slight feathering along the upper lip line after four hours of wear, though it was comfortable and non-drying while worn.",A
MAC,LAUNDRY LIST,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúvivid orange.‚Äù It‚Äôs a slightly muted, medium-dark orange with warm, yellow undertones and a cream finsh. It had almost full color coverage, but this one did settle in some lip lines, unlike Hot/Cold. This shade wore for six hours on me, and it didn‚Äôt feather or bleed. The formula wasn‚Äôt hydrating, but it wasn‚Äôt drying either.",A-
MAC,DELICATES,Bronzer,"a ‚Äúneutral deep bronze with fine gold shimmer.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark brown with soft, warm undertones and a golden shimmer-sheen finish. In order get color payoff for a swatch, I had to scrape off a layer of product with a metal spatula. The surface hardened noticeably after using it three times (once to swatch, twice to apply to the face). The texture is very thin and stiff, which made it difficult to dislodge color from the pan. Applied, it doesn‚Äôt look bad, and it has a nice, satin-matte finish that doesn‚Äôt look flat but isn‚Äôt luminous, but unless you‚Äôre very fair, you‚Äôll need to pack it on with five or six layers (I used eight just to get it to show up in photos). The powder that I did manage to apply lasted for seven hours before fading. It‚Äôs actually blendable once you get it on the brush, so it‚Äôs such a shame that it is pressed so firmly.",F
MAC,GOLDEN RINSE,Bronzer,"a ‚Äúlight brick reddish bronze with fine shimmer.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium tan brown with subtle, warm undertones and a barely-there, satiny sheen. The texture felt smooth to the touch, but it was extremely stiff and firmly packed into the pan, so it was a challenge to grab pigment from the powder without scraping off layers or jabbing a rough brush against the surface. The powder itself, once loosened, has a very silky feel that is blendable and sits beautifully on the skin‚Äìbut getting it on the skin is frustrating. With how firm the powder is, coverage is very sheer, but turned into a loose powder, it is more medium to full coverage depending on application. Applied, this shade wore well for seven hours on me.",F
MAC,FRESHEN UP,Bronzer,"a ‚Äúcolor wave ranging from coral to neutral.‚Äù Mixed together, it‚Äôs a lightly brightened, peachy tangerine with warm, reddish-orange tones and a very, very fine shimmer-sheen finish. (Keep in mind, most of the gold sheen on the surface is an over-spray, which I removed prior to swatching!)",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,#1 (NUDES YOU NEED),Eyeshadow,"nine Artist Shadows in neutral hues. I absolutely love this palette, and it‚Äôs so refreshing to see a brand put out a palette of their existing products that actually maintains the quality across the two. The pans are slightly smaller (24mm) than your typical eyeshadow pan (26mm, like MAC/Urban Decay), but I suspect they are deeper, as the full-sized eyeshadows are noticeably larger but only contain 0.02 oz. more (full-sized is 0.08 oz. each, and each in the palette is 0.06 oz.). The Artist Shadows have a few different finishes, and I find all of them to have a similar except the mattes; all the other finishes feel like a powder and cream hybrid, as they‚Äôre denser, creamier and have really rich, color payoff that adheres well to bare skin. The matte finish is more like a traditional powder eyeshadow, though Make Up For Ever‚Äôs version is nice: silky, smooth, finely-milled, and pigmented.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,203P GOLDEN PINK,Lipgloss,"a light-medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and gold pearl. The gloss had semi-sheer color coverage that lightened, brightened, and added a gold sparkle to my natural lip color, but it may be less noticeable on those with darker natural lip color. It wore well for four hours on me and was moderately tacky. It was a little hydrating over time and comfortable to wear overall, but there was slight settling into lip lines.",B-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,205P PEARLY ROSE,Lipgloss,"a muted, coral-red with pink and silver shimmer. This shade had semi-sheer to semi-opaque color coverage that went on somewhat evenly, but it could have looked smoother and more even. It wore well for five hours, was tacky, and slightly moisturizing.",B
MAKE UP FOR EVER,302P GOLDEN CORAL,Lipgloss,"a light-medium orange-coral with gold shimmer. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, but as it was a milkier color, it did pull into lip lines even from the beginning. It wore well for four hours and was lightly hydrating. The texture was light-medium in thickness and noticeably sticky.",B-
MAC,GLAMORIZED,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúcreamy vibrant pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, fuchsia magenta with strong, blue undertones and a soft shine. While it had semi-opaque pigmentation, it seemed to apply somewhat streakily, so it looked splotchy on. It lasted for five hours on me and was hydrating over time.",B
MAC,I'M IN,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúwarm rose.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium pink with warm undertones and fine, gold pearl. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque pigmentation (slightly less compared to most shades in the set of ten) that applied evenly. The formula was comfortable to wear and moisturizing over time, and it lasted for four hours on me.",B
MAC,BARE HUG,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúcreamy soft peach/orange.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, light-medium pink-coral with subtle gold pearl. It had semi-opaque color payoff that yielded a fair amount of color but had a slight translucency to it where the natural lip color still came through. It was comfortable to wear and lasted for four and a half hours on me. I was surprised at how similar this was to I‚Äôm In.",A-
COLOUR POP,APHRODISIAC,Blush,"a ‚Äúsoft beige brown in a matte finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium brown with subtle, warm undertones and a satiny sheen.",A-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,WHIP IT (304),Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúbold iridescent magenta.‚Äù It‚Äôs a vibrant, fuchsia-red with iridescent violet shimmer and cool, blue undertones. It had semi-opaque color coverage that went on fairly evenly and lasted for five hours. It was lightly hydrating over time, but I did notice that the color slipped into lip lines slightly as well. I think this is supposed to be similar to Boom Boom from the prior gloss formula, but it is a lesser version of it.",B+
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,LOVE DRUNK (320),Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúmauve-gold shimmer.‚Äù It‚Äôs a plummy brown with warm undertones and a dusting of fine, gold shimmer over a cream-like finish. It had semi-opaque oclor payoff that applied evenly, though I felt like something about the thickness of the formula emphasized lip lines, but it wasn‚Äôt clear if it was really the color settling in to me. The gloss lasted for four hours and was lightly moisturizing over time.",B
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,PINK STEAM (322),Lipgloss,"an ‚Äúiridescent lavender shimmer.‚Äù It‚Äôs a lavender purple with lighter lavender shimmer and cooler undertones. Applied, it is semi-sheer, so the natural pink of my lips comes through and makes the gloss appear more like a pinky-lavender (subsequently, warmer in appearance), which means this is a gloss that may look quite different based on your natural lip color. It goes on unevenly and looks streaky, and it lasted for three hours, though it was comfortable to wear and lightly hydrating.",D+
GUERLAIN,YELLOW IT-STICK (603),Lipstick,"a ‚Äúgolden tone.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, yellowed base with fine gold shimmer. It‚Äôs supposed to have an ‚Äúiridescent, sheer finish‚Äù for a ‚Äúbarely there look,‚Äù so as you might expect‚Ä¶ it is sheer. If you wanted to wear bright, sunshine yellow on your lips, you‚Äôre out of luck. If you wanted a sheer layer of golden shimmer, this is your speed. It has a lightweight, very emollient, wet-like feel on the lips, so it glides on without tugging. On its own, it lasts only two hours, making it one of the shorter-wearing shades I‚Äôve tried in the formula, though it was hydrating.",B-
GUERLAIN,FLUO STILETTO (662),Lipstick,"a ‚Äúneon pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs an extremely bright, magenta fuchsia with cool, blue undertones and a soft shine. It had semi-opaque color coverage that went on fairly evenly with a lightweight consistency that wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin. It wore well for five hours and left a slight stain behind while feeling moisturizing while worn. It is a very dupable color, as this is just one of those shades that every brand seems to do at some point, though less do it with the glossier finish (many options are more matte), but there are still lots of variations on it.",B+
YVES SAINT LAURENT,ONDE SABLE (04),Eyeshadow,"a peachy gold with warm undertones and a frosted, metallic finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that went on fairly evenly when applied with a brush. It wore well for ten hours before creasing on me.",B-
YVES SAINT LAURENT,PINK CASCADE (06),Eyeshadow,"a rosy peach-copper with warm undertones and a metallic finish. It was semi-opaque to opaque, depending on how much product was caught on the applicator, but it thickens a lot on the skin, so you may want to apply less than you think. This shade flaked off in clumps at the eight-hour mark, but when I wore it as a semi-opaque wash of color blended all-over the lid, I had less issues with flaking until twelve hours of wear.",B-
TARTE,EMPOWER FLOWER,Palette,"eight eyeshadows, two blushes, and one bronzer. Tarte says it‚Äôs supposed to ‚Äúempower you to play up your look from daytime to playtime,‚Äù though I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more apt to say day to night, as there are some smokier, darkening shades that you could use for a more ‚Äúnighttime‚Äù look. I tend to associate ‚Äúplaytime‚Äù with brighter, bolder, or more unique colors and/or finishes. It‚Äôs a disappointing palette with two exceptionally dismal eyeshadows and one unimpressive blush that really bring it down, but there were few shades here that were actually good.",C
KAT VON D,SHADE + LIGHT,Palette,"twelve eyeshadows that are categorized into three ‚Äúquads,‚Äù divided between neutral, cool, and warm (supposedly, at least). The formula is described as ‚Äúblendable and buildable‚Äù with ‚Äúhigh-pigment, long-wear‚Äù that ‚Äú[delivers] rich color.‚Äù",B+
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,THE LOVER (220),Palette,"a mix of light to medium-dark neutrals in shades of pink, peach, and brown. It has a lot more mid-tone shades than your average palette; I think it could have benefited from another medium-dark or dark hued shade so that you could get more contrast out of this palette. It performed fairly well with the common issues being slightly shorter wear than average with some shades being more semi-opaque or prone to sheering out due to their textures.",B+
URBAN DECAY,INDECENT,Blush,"a ‚Äúlight peachy nude.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, peach-orange with warm undertones and a satin finish.",A
URBAN DECAY,FETISH,Blush,"a ‚Äúmedium pink nude.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark rosy pink with subtle, warm undertones and a mostly matte finish.",B+
URBAN DECAY,69,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúbright red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium-dark red with cool, blue undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. The consistency was light-medium in weight with a smooth, almost gel-like feel that spread easily across the lips. It developed tackiness as it wore on, and it was moderately tacky by the end of wear. The color had semi-opaque coverage that went on evenly overall, and it lasted for five and a half hours with some hydration.",B+
URBAN DECAY,ASSASSIN,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúbright pink with glitter.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, pinky-red with cool, blue undertones and pink and gold shimmer. It had somewhat opaque coverage, where there was noticeable color, but a lot of the lip color still came through. It wasn‚Äôt as pigmented as expected, and the opacity didn‚Äôt seem to be offset by an increase in shimmer (which can sometimes create the illusion of coverage). It sank into lip lines just slightly after a few hours of wear, but the texture is forgiving enough where you can smooth out the color by pressing your lips together. On me, it wore well for five hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.",B
URBAN DECAY,BRICKHOUSE,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúdark brick-red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark red with subtle, warm undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage that went on evenly and wore well for six hours. The formula was comfortable to wear, though sticky, and hydrating over time.",A
URBAN DECAY,KINKY,Blush,"a ‚Äúlight peach with light shimmer.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, peach-orange with lighter golden orange shimmer over a satiny finish.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,BLACK OYSTER,Palette,"a set designed to give you an ultra sparkly, smoky eye. It pairs a sparkly silver powder eyeshadow with a silver-sparkled black cream eyeshadow together. When layered, the silver powder eyeshadow intensifies the sparkle and finish of the cream eyeshadow, but it doesn‚Äôt alter the color much. Of the four duos, this was my least favorite, as the powder eyeshadow was under-performing, though the cream eyeshadow performed well.",B+
URBAN DECAY,QUICKIE,Blush,"a ‚Äúbright pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, magenta pink with cool, blue undertones and a mostly matte finish.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,NAKED BRONZE,Palette,"a mix of glittering gold and warm, coppery bronze, which you may know as Spice (previously released on its own). When the gold eyeshadow is patted over the bronze cream eyeshadow, you get a lighter, more sparkly bronze that has a more subdued red undertone. They work well together as shades side-by-side or layered. The formula of the sparkly eyeshadow suffers from some fall out during wear, and it could be a bit more pigmented in its base color, while the cream eyeshadow is fantastic with rich color payoff and a smooth, blendable, long-wearing formula.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,PINK GLOW,Palette,"an indulgence, but it performs well across the board and everything works well together. The majority of the colors are on the dupable side, so some may find there are too many near-repeats to make it a worthwhile splurge. I‚Äôm a huge fan of Tom Ford‚Äôs blush formula‚Äìit‚Äôs my favorite‚Äìand constantly wish he would expand it (permanently!), and the blushes in here are gorgeous. I cannot express to you how glowing and luminous the effect of the two are, individually or layered together. The palette has strong, warmer undertones across all of the shades. The weakest performer was the glittery shade, which had some fall out, but the almost wet-like texture helped it apply with stronger coverage and less fall out initially than your traditional, more true-to-powder-form glittery eyeshadow.",A
HOURGLASS,RADIANT BRONZE LIGHT,Bronzer,"a ‚Äúwarm bronze shade fused with Radiant Light.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark brown with warm, yellow undertones and a soft, golden shimmer-sheen finish.",A-
URBAN DECAY,APOCALYPSE,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúdeep purple-wine.‚Äù It‚Äôs a lightly muted, dark plummy burgundy with warm undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage that felt smooth going on, but it looked somewhat uneven. The gloss lasted for six hours and was hydrating while worn. It feels non-sticky initially but gradually develops tackiness as the gloss wears down and has no discernible taste and very subtle sweet vanilla scent.",B
URBAN DECAY,BITTERSWEET,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúbright purple.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark pink-based purple with a creamy, glossy finish. This was one of the worst performers‚Äìand one I so badly wanted to be true!purple!‚Äìwith a very streaky application and semi-sheer color payoff. It lasted for five hours and was hydrating, but it looked so splotchy that I think the only way to wear it is to apply it over a lip liner or lipstick.",C-
URBAN DECAY,VICE,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúdark purple with glitter.‚Äù It‚Äôs a reddish-berry with cool undertones and subtle violet shimmer. The shimmer is fairly subtle, and it just has a very light dusting of sparkle that is fine enough that I never felt it while wearing the gloss. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, but there‚Äôs noticeable translucency so the natural lip color will come through. On me, the gloss wore well for almost six hours and was nicely moisturizing while worn.",A-
URBAN DECAY,BANG,Blush,"a ‚Äúbright red-orange.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium-dark orange with warm, red undertones and a very subtle golden satin sheen.",A
URBAN DECAY,VIDEO,Blush,"a ‚Äúsoft nude.‚Äù It‚Äôs a softened, medium brown with warm, lightly rosy undertones and a semi-matte finish.",A
URBAN DECAY,BIG BANG,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúbright pink with glitter.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark pink-red with fuchsia shimmer. It appears redder on the lips and loses some of that bright fuchsia applied. The shimmer is fine enough that it doesn‚Äôt add a noticeable texture to the gloss, even as it wears away. The consistency seems slightly thinner compared to the cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly well, while the color stayed on for six hours and was hydrating over time. I noticed a smidgen of color that settled into lip lines, but with the gloss formula, it was easy to press lips together and even it back out.",B+
URBAN DECAY,SAVAGE,Lipgloss,"an ‚Äúelectric pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, cotton candy pink with strong, blue undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque color payoff that didn‚Äôt apply evenly. The gloss tended to look streaky and uneven. It wore well for five hours and was moderately hydrating while worn.",B-
URBAN DECAY,SCANDAL,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúbright pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, brightened medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered fairly evenly, but there was very subtle streaking that you can see in the close-up that wasn‚Äôt noticeable in person. It lasted for six hours on me and hydrating while worn.",A-
URBAN DECAY,BACKFIRE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúburgundy with purple shift.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark purple with subtle, warmer undertones and a cooler purple overtone. The duochrome seemed weak here; it‚Äôs hard to even tell when angling one‚Äôs arm in the light to find it. It had great pigmentation with a soft, creamy, and very dense texture that applied easily and blended well. The color lasted for eight hours on me.",A-
URBAN DECAY,DIVE BAR,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúmedium blue with pink-purple shift.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark, periwinkle blue with lighter violet shimmer and sheen. There‚Äôs a definite shift with this one that you can see with ease. It had semi-opaque color payoff, though it was very buildable and applied well to bare skin. The texture is so dense that it feels almost like a cream product, and there is no fall out or powdery excess‚Äìit feels unlike the majority of the brand‚Äôs current eyeshadow range as a result. It goes on well but also blends beautifully and takes little time to diffuse. It lasted for eight hours on me. I really liked this one, even though it could have been more pigmented right off the bat, and it was a more unique shade within my stash.",A-
URBAN DECAY,FIREBALL,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúpeach with pink shift.‚Äù It‚Äôs a darkened, yellow gold that flashes to peachy-pink to warmer, pink-peach with a metallic sheen. The duochrome is very strong with this one, which is fantastic, as you can really see it even applied on the eyelid. The texture was smooth and almost cream-like as it had a very dense feel. It applied with good color payoff and blended well. The color stayed put for eight hours before creasing.",A-
URBAN DECAY,TONIC,Eyeshadow,"Ua ‚Äúlilac with blue shift.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, lavender purple with warmer, pink tones and a bluish-violet iridescent sheen. The texture was incredibly smooth and creamy‚Äìagain, it almost feel like a cream product‚Äìwith zero powderiness or excess. It was so dreamy to work with as it was easy to blend, had good color payoff, and lasted for eight hours. This shade is a bit different than the other purples Urban Decay has, but it is rather close to a few of them that I don‚Äôt think you need all the variations unless you wear this type of shade all the time‚Äìbut I think this may be the best one to-date with respect to quality.",A
URBAN DECAY,BITTERSWEET,Blush,"a ‚Äúbright purple.‚Äù It‚Äôs a softened, medium purple with subtle, pink undertones and a mostly matte finish. It seems to run slightly cool in undertone, but I think it may depend on what you pair it with whether it will read genuinely cool-toned or not.",A-
NARS,QUANTUM,Blush,"a ‚Äúsheer iridescent magenta.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark pink with cool undertones and subtle silver and pink micro-shimmer. It is sheer, just as described, with a very thin consistency that I found difficult to spread across the skin for even color. The Multiple itself is almost dry with a velvety feel, like a cream eyeshadow that‚Äôs on its last legs and has pulled away from the edges of the jar. It seemed more like a blush with a satin finish than a highlighting/illuminating product. On cheeks, it lasted for six hours on me, and on lips, it was a painful two hours before I had to remove it, because my lips were so, so parched. I try really hard to wear things for as long as they‚Äôll wear, drying or not, but I couldn‚Äôt make it past two hours ‚Äì and I suspect it would have lasted around three at most.",D+
NARS,VIOLET ATOM,Blush,"a ‚Äúsheer iridescent violet.‚Äù It‚Äôs a cool-toned, pinky-lavender base with iridescent gold and violet shimmer. Again, it‚Äôs as sheer as you‚Äôd expect, given the description and its categorization as an ‚ÄúIlluminating Multiple.‚Äù The color had an iridescent sheen to it that made it seem like a more unique shade to me. The drier, thin consistency of this product made it prone to clumping. I only was able to apply it by taking a chunk off of it, warming it between my fingertips, and then patting it and swiping at it with the edge of my finger to blend it out. The color lasted for seven hours on the cheeks, and it lasted an hour on my lips and felt like it was sucking the life out of them every second of that hour.",C
CLINIQUE,FIG POP,Blush,"a deepened, orange-coral with a hint of pink-red and a subtle, golden micro-shimmer that gives it a luminous sheen.",A+
MAC,DESERT ROADTRIP,Blush,a ‚Äúgolden bronze.‚Äù It‚Äôs a copper-brown with warm undertones and a lighter golden copper frosted shimmer-sheen finish.,A-
COLOUR POP,CLUTCH,Blush,"a ‚Äúvivid rosy red in a matte finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, brightened, medium-dark pink-red with cool undertones and a mostly matte finish.",A
BURBERRY,SHELL (003),Eyeshadow,"a brilliant, brightened golden orange with warm undertones and a strong, metallic sheen. The texture was soft, smooth, and very blendable on the skin. It can be applied wet or dry, with dry application giving lighter, slightly sheer coverage and damp application giving you a slightly deeper, more metallic finish. It wore well for nine hours before creasing a bit.",A
BURBERRY,ROSEWOOD (202),Eyeshadow,"a softened, medium-dark taupe brown with warm, golden beige shimmer that gives it a more pearly finish. It‚Äôs supposed to give a ‚Äúmore natural, buildable‚Äù effect when used dry with a more ‚Äúsaturated color effect‚Äù when used damp, though I didn‚Äôt see significant differences between the two applications. It‚Äôs a bit softer dry, and the shimmery finish is stronger when applied damp, but the differences are very subtle. The formula of the new range doesn‚Äôt seem to feel or perform differently than what I‚Äôve experienced in the original eyeshadow range, though this seems to run lighter than the original in color. The texture is incredibly soft and silky‚Äìa little powdery at times‚Äìand blends effortlessly on the skin. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading to a small degree.",B+
BURBERRY,PALE BARLEY (102),Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark taupe brown with a hint of rose and a subtly metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque coverage applied dry and opaque coverage applied damp, and the finish became more metallic when it was applied with a wet brush. The consistency was very finely-milled and silky, but it was a little powdery. It wore well for eight hours before fading regardless of application method.",B+
NYX,APPLE CRISP,Lipgloss,"a bold, bright, medium red with cool, blue undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. It had rich, opaque color coverage that applied smoothly and evenly without pulling into lip lines. The consistency wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin, but it is heavier than the original formula of Butter Glosses. It developes light tackiness over time and lasts four hours on me. It was neither drying nor hydrating over time. There is a faint smell of vanilla but no discernible taste, but the scent seemed off in some way to me.",A-
NYX,BANANA SPLIT,Lipgloss,"a brightened, light-medium peach-orange with warm undertones and a creamy, high-shine finish. While it had nearly full color coverage, the thicker consistency seemed to make very prone to settling into lip lines from the get-go. Even when I would try to smooth out the color, the color would sink right back into those lip lines. The gloss lasted for four hours, and the settling just worsened as I wore it.",C+
NYX,BERRY STRUDEL,Lipgloss,"a brightened, violet purple with a hint of pink and fairly cool undertones. It had a creamy, glossy finish. The texture was thinner, so it felt more like the original formula, but it was prone to streaking. It was really hard to get the color to look even, and as it wore away, it settled into lip lines. The gloss wore well for four hours on me. It‚Äôs a cool color, and it is hard to dupe, so it might be worth the extra effort to make it work if you really have been wanting a purple lipgloss.",C
CLINIQUE,MELON POP,Blush,"a light-medium, pink-coral with warm undertones and a luminous sheen.",A-
NYX,PLAYDATE,Lipstick,"a muted, light-medium lavender with a gray overcast and a satiny sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly for the most part. The consistency had some slip in it, so it was easy to apply and felt comfortable on. The color wore well for four hours but pulled into lip lines slightly after two and a half hours of wear. It was neither drying nor hydrating.",B
NYX,PRIVILEGED,Lipstick,"a bright pop of light-medium pink with cool, blue undertones and a light shine. It had rich, opaque color payoff in a single pass with a lightly creamy, slightly slippery consistency that glides on easily but has a thicker consistency (not thick per se, just thicker). This shade stayed on well for four and a half hours and left a stain behind. It wasn‚Äôt hydrating nor was it moisturizing, but it was comfortable to wear. It‚Äôs a very dupable shade of bright pink with the only differentiating factors being that it‚Äôs not the most neon, but it‚Äôs still on the lighter side.",A
NYX,TWISTED,Lipstick,"abrightened, light-medium orchid purple with some pink and a satiny sheen. It had mostly opaque color coverage that went on evenly and deposited smooth color. The consistency is lightly creamy with some slip so it glides on easily. It wore well for four hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
MAC,DIVA-ISH,Lipstick,"an ‚Äúintense fuchsia [with an Amplified finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark fuchsia pink with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage that went on smoothly for the most part, but it looked like it was less forgiving of any imperfections compared to the average shade in this type of finish (just slightly). It wore well for four and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
MAC,MAKE ME GORGEOUS,Lipstick,"an ‚Äúintense coral pink [with an Amplified finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, light-medium coral with a hint of pink, warm undertones, and a soft shine. It had excellent pigmentation that yielded full coverage with smooth, even color. It wore well for four and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
MAC,REAL DOLL,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúlight pink-lilac [with a Lustre finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a cool-toned, light-medium pink with a hint of lavender and a light shine. It had semi-sheer color coverage that lasted for two hours and pulled into lip lines slightly over time. I also found it lightly drying. It looked a little streaky at times‚Äìyou have to be very careful not to over-apply as it is very unforgiving if you do. This shade has been released previously.",C
MAC,REAL REDHEAD,Lipstick,a ‚Äúmauve nude [with a Lustre finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a peachy-brown with a soft shine and warm undertones. It had semi-sheer coverage that added warmth and evenness to my natural lip color. It lasted for an hour and a half and was drying when worn.,B-
MAC,REEL SEXY,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright coral [with an Amplified finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a peachy-coral with a very slight hint of pink, warm undertones, and a satiny sheen. It had mostly opaque color coverage that could be a somewhat streaky at times. It lasted for four and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating for me, but I had some color settle into lip lines over time when worn. This shade has been released previously.",B+
MAC,SILLY,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright white-pink [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, light-medium pink with slight cool, blue undertones and a mostly matte finish. It applied with opaque coverage and a lightly velvety consistency that didn‚Äôt pull or drag on the lips. The color lasted for five hours, was a smigden drying on me, and settled into lip lines to a small degree after three hours of wear. This shade has been released previously.",A-
MAC,WHO'S THE DJ?,Palette,"six lipsticks that range from light beige to aqua blue. All of the colors applied and looked lighter on than they did in the pan. I love the concept; I love seeing non-traditional colors released in a major way, because it‚Äôs fun and interesting and different. It would have been really spectacular if MAC launched a coordinating six-pan eyeshadow palette with these shades in eyeshadow form, though! I wish the performance of the shades was better; the blue and green were disappointing and need a base to work (lip primer, concealer, lip liner, and so forth), so it‚Äôs more of a miss, but it was fun to play with. I was surprised at how well the lavender shade applied and wore!",C+
MAC,NO FAUX PAS,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúyellow hot pink [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertonews and a mostly matte finish. It had intense, opaque color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly. The texture has a slightly thicker, velvety consistency that is heavier (but not truly heavy!) and minimizes the look of lines on the lips. It wears for six and a half hours and leaves a stain behind but is neither drying nor hydrating. This shade was released previously (just this past October).",A
MAC,CARDINAL,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúyellow burgundy red [with a Satin finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a meidum-dark red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a satiny sheen. It had mostly opaque coverage that applied evenly. On me, this shade wore well for five and a half hours but was lightly drying over time. In my MAC spreadsheet, I have this shade listed as a previously released shade, but I can‚Äôt recall where from (I couldn‚Äôt find a previous review for it).",A-
MAC,HOLLYWOOD CERISE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúmagenta berry [with a Satin finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, fuchsia-berry with cool undertones and a satin sheen. It had nearly opaque coverage that went on with smooth, even color. It was comfortable to wear as it was neither drying nor hydrating over the five hours it lasted.",A
MAC,PUTTIN' ON THE SPRITZ,Blush,"a ‚Äúbright intense coral.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, orange-coral with warm undertones and a satin sheen. It had buildable color payoff whether patted onto cheeks or applied to lips that could be blended out for sheer color or layered for true-to-pan coverage. I would highly recommend applying this with a lip brush if you want to use it as a lip color, as you‚Äôll get better coverage, evenness, and it will be less drying (but regardless, it is always somewhat drying worn as a lip product‚Äìit‚Äôs uncomfortable for me after an hour and a half of wear‚Äìand lasts two and a half hours). As a blusher, a stippling or duo fiber brush works just fine, but a little goes a long way! It wears for seven hours on the cheeks.",B+
MAC,P.S. I LIKE YOU,Blush,"a ‚Äúcarnation pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium pink with warm undertones and a soft sheen. As a lip color, it is drying and lasts for two hours. As a blush, it is blendable and wears for seven hours.",B
MAC,SUMMER WIND,Blush,"a ‚Äúpale sand shimmer.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, golden beige with warm undertones and a soft sheen.",B
MAC,BLUSH PINK,Highlighter,"a ‚Äúlight pink with silver.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, pink-peach with a semi-matte finish. The silver is an over-spray that will disappear after one use.",C
MAC,NUDE PINK,Highlighter,a ‚Äúchampagne base with silver.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium peachy-beige witha very fine gold shimmer. The silver is merely an over-spray and disappears the first time the brush swishes across the surface (which I removed prior to swatching/using).,B-
MAC,MARIA MORETTI,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúcherry red [with an Amplified finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium-dark red with cool, blue undertones and a very fine ruby red pearl with a light shine. It had mostly opaque color coverage that applied with really even, smooth color in a single stroke. The consistency was lightly creamy and never dragged when I applied it from the tube. On me, the color lasted for six hours and left a stain behind. It was neither drying nor hydrating. It is slightly shinier and brighter compared to Cardinal from the collaboration with Philip Treacy.",A
MAC,HIGH TEA,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbeige pink with pearl [with a Lustre finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, light-medium beige-brown with lighter gold shimmer and a luminous sheen. It had sheer color coverage that lightened and warmed up my natural color while added a frosted sheen. It lasted for two hours and was drying over time with some color pulling into lip lines after an hour and a half of wear.",C+
MAC,BOUFFANT,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúpale peach shimmer [with a Veluxe Pearl finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, pinky-peach with warm undertones and a frosted sheen. It had semi-opaque color payoff with a fairly soft, smooth consistency that was blendable and buildable in color. It wore well for eight hours before creasing on me. I expected this to have some dupes, but it was surprisingly dupable.",B+
MAC,YOGURT,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúchalky pale pink [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, neutral-to-cool-toned pink with a matte finish. The texture was firm and thin, which made it harder to get color off of the surface. It lasted for seven hours before fading. This shade is part of the permanent range.",C-
COLOUR POP,BIRTHDAY SUIT,Blush,"a ‚Äúneutral pink with a satin finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium pink with subtle, neutral-to-warm undertones and silver-ish micro-shimmer.",B+
CLINIQUE,PINK POP,Blush,"a soft, medium rosy pink with very subtle cool, blue undertones and a luminous sheen. It‚Äôs almost neutral, but it leans a little cool-toned against my warmer skin tone.",A+
TOO FACED,MELTED JELLY DONUT,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdragon fruit pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, bright fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a creamy, glossy finish.",A+
BECCA COSMETICS,PEARL,Highlighter,"a ‚Äúwhite pearl.‚Äù It‚Äôs a neutral-to-cool-toned, shimmery white with a luminous finish.",A-
BECCA COSMETICS,MOONSTONE,Highlighter,"a ‚Äúpale gold.‚Äù It‚Äôs a soft, light-medium gold with warm undertones and a luminous sheen.",A-
NARS,JUBILATION,Palette,"a warm-toned duo that is for those who love shimmer and metallic finishes. The texture of both shades is a bit firmer, so using ultra-soft brushes may get you poor results (e.g. blue squirrel haired brushes don‚Äôt work well, but goat hair and synthetic brushes worked fine). The color payoff was good regardless of dry or damp application, though the shimmer in the finishes was amplified when I used the shades damp. The ‚Äútranslucent wash of color‚Äù for damp application continues to elude me‚ÄìI get nothing but intense color (and my brush is lightly misted, not sopping wet!). I would recommend a duo fiber brush like MAC‚Äôs 159 for applying these damp, rather than NARS‚Äô own brush, as the damp application easily lifts base products and/or moves the brush around together while lifting it from place to place rather than blending it out, and I‚Äôve had the best luck with the duo fiber brushes as they swirl without lifting the best. Damp application is a lot more work, because it is quite fussy.",C+
MAC,LAVENDER JADE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdirty mauve with gold pearl [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a cool-toned, light-medium lavender purple with a satin finish. It had rich, opaque color coverage that went on smoothly and evenly. The texture was a little thick overall, and I noticed some of the color pulled into lip lines after four hours of wear, though total wear time was around five hours. It was lightly drying after three hours.",A-
MAC,FORBIDDEN SUNRISE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúcreamy orange [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium orange with strong, yellow and red undertones with a very subtle gold micro-shimmer and a more satiny finish. The texture had that same, slightly thickened consistency but still applied well with even, opaque color coverage. On me, it wore well for six hours and felt a bit drying at the four-hour mark. The lightness coupled with the stronger yellow undertones make it less common compared to the more typical orange-red.",A
MAC,ROMANTIC BREAKDOWN,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúsheer nude [with a Lustre finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, light peach with a hint of beige, warmer undertones, and a subtle shimmer. It had semi-sheer color coverage with a noticeable sheen and slight shimmer, which is what you might expect from a Lustre finish (they are designed as a sheerer option). The texture is thinner with some slip, and it applied fairly evenly though it pulled into lip lines as I wore it. This shade lasted for two and a half hours on me and was drying.",C+
NARS,CRAVING,Palette,"a highlighter and bronzer duo. The two work together well, and when applied dry, they can be quite flattering on the skin, though dry application doesn‚Äôt have the best staying power. Both shades tended to emphasize the skin‚Äôs natural texture and any imperfections when applied with a damp brush, unfortunately, as the shimmery finishes intensified. To reiterate what I‚Äôve mentioned in previous reviews: NARS describes the damp application as a sheer wash of color, but the reality is that this type of application yields deeper, richer, more opaque coverage than dry, and it also makes it harder to work with, as it doesn‚Äôt blend as readily as the formula does used dry.",B
ESTEE LAUDER,ULTRA PINK,Lipstick,"a ‚Äútranslucent berry hue.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, pinkish-red with cool undertones and a subtle shine.",C-
ESTEE LAUDER,IRIDESCENT BALL,Highlighter,a sheer wash of champagne sheen.,D+
ESTEE LAUDER,COURREGES,Highlighter,"a ‚Äúglowing, otherworldly‚Äù powder with a ‚Äúburst of pure light.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, golden champagne with a frosted, metallic sheen.",B+
GUCCI,TUSCAN STORM,Palette,"a warm-toned, neutral palette. I thought it would be more neutral or even slightly cool-leaning, but it seemed rather warm in person. It‚Äôs decent to good, but it‚Äôs not perfect, and at this price point, the downsides hard to overlook‚Äìworsened by the fact that all four shades are rather dupable.",B
LANCOME,MY FRENCH PALETTE,Palette,"nine shades with two that double as powder eyeliners. Six of the nine shades are neutrals, and then two are in the teal family with one blackish-gray. The formula used in the palette really needs an eyeshadow primer in order for the majority of the shades to have good color coverage and smooth, even application, as it had a more powder quality that made it harder to apply to bare skin (or else it would sheer out immediately as the product didn‚Äôt stick well).",B-
COLOUR POP,REBOUND,Palette,"four shades for spring/summer 2015. Those who tend to prefer more matte finishes may like that this set includes three more matte shades and one sparkly shade. There‚Äôs something to be said about reading carefully, though, as this set includes three Super Shock Shadows and one Super Shock Pressed Pigment (Ex); with the latter being ‚Äúnot intended for use in the immediate eye area.‚Äù I missed that until I sat down last week to write-up the review, so you‚Äôll see it included in the eye look with the other shades, but I tested it as a blush (and it is only be rated as a blush) after that.",A-
CHANEL,MISIA (418),Lipstick,"a ‚Äúcopper orange.‚Äù It‚Äôs a softened, medium orange with warm undertones and a soft, frosted finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage where there was visible color, but there was a translucent quality to it that would allow the natural lip color to come through. The texture was lightweight with some slip, and it glided on without tugging and distributed even coverage. It lasted for four hours on me and was somewhat hydrating.",A-
CHANEL,MARIE (430),Lipstick,"an ‚Äúintense red pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium rosy pink with soft white shimmer and a light frosted finish. It had mostly opaque coverage with some translucency, so the natural lip color will come through and may alter the way this looks, depending on what your lip color is naturally. The texture had some slip, which made it easy to apply, but it didn‚Äôt slide around too much. It lasted for four hours on me and was somewhat hydrating.",A-
CHANEL,ARTHUR (440),Lipstick,"a ‚Äúluminous red.‚Äù It‚Äôs medium-dark, orange-red with warm undertones and a subtle shimmer and luminous finish. It had mostly opaque coverage that went on evenly and smoothly, though there is still that translucent quality so it isn‚Äôt fully opaque. The texture has more slip than thickness. It was lightly hydrating and lasted for four and a half hours on me. This is the type of color that is incredibly dupable; there are so many near dupes that just vary by glossiness in the finish or being slightly more orange or redder.",A-
GUERLAIN,LES PRECIEUX (504),Palette,"a new, limited edition palette for spring that features four shades ranging from olive green, peach, light yellow, and brown. A few of Guerlain‚Äôs quads I like, but a lot of them are less impressive. There‚Äôs definitely something different about the formula in the more recent iterations that is drier and more powdery, which has, in turn, made them sheerer, harder to apply, and shorter-wearing.",B-
NARS,ADORATION,Palette,"one of six duos that will be available on March 4th. The lighter shade was best applied dry, as damp application resulted in such a metallic finish that it was more like a flashing, neon sign that said, ‚ÄúHey, my skin isn‚Äôt perfect! I have pores! And texture!‚Äù The darker shade ended up becoming much, much more pigmented when applied damp, but it become too shimmery, and it lasted longer that way. It was easier to apply, blend, and control applied dry, though, and coverage was buildable so greater intensity was achievable with two or three passes. Wear time is fairly good regardless of application method, but I get slightly longer results with a damp application. The texture is firm, but smooth, and it doesn‚Äôt feel dry or stiff, but it seems to have a firmer press overall.",B
NYX,BEACH BABE,Blush,"a brightened, gold-shimmered brown with warm, reddish-yellow undertones and a frosted finish.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,BLACK JADE,NailPolish,"a blackened green with subtle neutral-to-cool undertones and a fine lighter green shimmer. It was nearly opaque in a single coat, though I applied two to be sure. The finish was naturally glossy when it dried down, and the coverage was smooth and even. It wore well for seven days on me with very minor tip wear.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,INDIGO NIGHT,NailPolish,"an inky, blackened navy blue with fine, brighter blue shimmer. It was opaque after two coats of polish, and the color went on evenly with smooth, glossy end results. The texture was slightly thin with this shade. This shade also lasted for seven days on me with very minor tip wear.",A
CHANEL,PERLE DE LUNE (916),Eyeliner,"a taupe brown with a silvered, metallic sheen.",D+
PHYSICIANS FORMULA,NATURAL,Blush,a light-medium pink with warm undertones and a satin finish.,B-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,RIPE PLUM,Palette,"a iridescent opal and deeper burgundy-brown. I like the concept, and the two colors work well off of each other, as when you blend them together, they create a lighter, iridescent plum shade, but they both have room for improvement.",B
MAC,AZALEA BLOSSOM,Blush,a ‚Äúlight cool pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium lavender pink with cool undertones and a satin finish.,B-
MAC,MYSTERY PRINCESS,Highlighter,"a ‚Äúpink beige with silver shimmer.‚Äù It‚Äôs a sparkling, cool-toned beige with a white base and a metallic, frosted sheen. MAC also described this as ‚Äúmatte‚Äù in the press release, but it is definitely not that, so my guess is that was misprint/mistake.",B+
MAC,GLASS SLIPPER,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúlight milky pink with pinkish pearl.‚Äù It‚Äôs a translucent, milky light pink with fine silver and pink shimmer. Applied, you can see the milkiness as it lightens my natural lip color. It has a noticeable amount of shimmer, but it‚Äôs not a lot. It‚Äôs a subtler gloss than you‚Äôd expect, given how shimmery it appears in the tube. The gloss lasted for three hours on me. MAC has put out a lot of barely-there, shimmery kind of glosses, and I think they can be pretty and often look more sparkling (and interesting) in person than in photos. I‚Äôd love to have seen a little more pigment in the base, especially since the lipsticks are on the sheer side, too.",B-
MAC,HAPPILY EVER AFTER,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúcool milky pink with bluish pearl.‚Äù It has a milky, pinky-white base with lots of bluish-teal sparkle and finer silver shimmer. This one was interesting, and anyone who tends to gravitate towards really sparkly glosses might like it. I think it looks more complex in person than it looks in photos, as the pearl is noticeably blue-tinged. It had semi-sheer color at most, but the milky base settled into lip lines, unfortunately. I was surprised this wasn‚Äôt called Glass Slipper, as the blue pearl reminded me of them. It wore well for three hours.",B-
MAC,EVIL STEPMOTHER,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúblack plum with plum pearl.‚Äù It‚Äôs a blackened purple with cool undertones and a pink shimmer that gives it a more frosted finish. Applied dry, it is less shimmery and goes on unevenly with so-so color payoff. Applied damp, it is more even and more pigmented, but it is hard to blend. The texture was fine but dry, so it wasn‚Äôt my favorite pigment to work with. It lasted for eight hours applied. ",C+
MAC,PRETTY IT UP,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúolive with pearlized pigments.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark bronze brown with warm, yellow undertones and a frosted, sparky finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff applied wet or dry, but it is easier to work with damp, as there‚Äôs minimal fall out and the product goes on very smoothly. It wore well for eight hours before creasing slightly. This shade was released as part of a holiday set, but the texture of the version in this collection is much finer and binds together a lot better.",B+
COLOUR POP,LOVELY,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúsoft light gold with ‚Ä¶ flecks of ‚Ä¶ glitter.‚Äù It‚Äôs a sparkling, light-medium gold with a glittery, metallic finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff, though the consistency was very smooth and lightly creamy, so it blended well on the skin. The color payoff was buildable to more opaque coverage, but there‚Äôs a fine line as you build to avoid it thickening as well. It lasted for nine hours but had noticeable fall out.",B-
COLOUR POP,ON THE ROCKS,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúvibrant true bronze with gold and violet glitter.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened coppery bronze with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. There was slight glitter in it, too, but it seemed primarily metallic applied. It was nicely pigmented, while the formula was creamy, blendable, and wore well for ten hours.",A
COLOUR POP,MOONING,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúrich blackened bronze ‚Ä¶ with ‚Ä¶ pearlized glitter.‚Äù It‚Äôs a deepened bronze-shimmered brown with fine sparkle and a frost finish. It had rich color payoff that went on evenly with smooth color application. It wore well for ten hours before fading, but there was minor fall out.",A
COLOUR POP,BANDIT,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúwarm rusty brown with a matte finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark brown with warm, red-orange undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had good color payoff that applied evenly and smoothly. It blends well on the skin, though it is more prone to sheering out slightly compared to the more shimmery shades in the range. It wore well for nine hours before creasing slightly.",A-
ESTEE LAUDER,BURGUNDY SUEDE,Eyeliner,"a darkened burgundy purple with warm undertones and subtle pearly shimmer. It has a very waxy base, so while it glides across the skin without tugging, the color payoff in a single stroke is semi-sheer. It was buildable to mostly opaque color, and while I love the color but don‚Äôt find the formula to be particularly long-wearing as it thins after seven hours of wear.",C
ESTEE LAUDER,ELECTRIC COBALT,Eyeliner,"a brightened, medium blue with a pearly sheen. It had semi-sheer pigmentation in a single pass, which was buildable to opaque color in two to three layers. It had the same waxy, glide-on texture that made it comfortable to apply but just not an intensely pigmented product. It wore well for seven hours before migrating towards the outer corner.",C+
ESTEE LAUDER,EMERALD VOLT,Eyeliner,"a darkened green-teal with a pearly sheen. It had mostly opaque pigmentation in one pass, and the texture was better balanced between creamy and waxy, so it glided on, deposited even, rich color, and didn‚Äôt run. The color lasted for eight hours on me.",A-
ANASTASIA,PURE HOLLYWOOD,Lipstick,a light-medium peach with a hint of pink and an ultra matte finish.,C-
DIOR,HOUSE OF PINKS,Palette,"a pink-hued palette with five shades ranging from pink-tinted ivory to mauve. Despite having continual poor luck with the quality in Dior‚Äôs palettes, I remain a glutton for punishment and bought both of the new spring palettes. I wasn‚Äôt impressed with House of Pinks due to its drier, unforgiving texture‚Äìit made my entire lid space look dry. I thought Monochrome was frustrating to work with (I tested both simultaneously, one on each eye), but Monochrome didn‚Äôt emphasize texture nearly as much, despite being more powdery (I guess that‚Äôs the where the silkiness came into play). The consistency of the eyeshadows was generally firmer and drier, while the color payoff ranged from semi-sheer to semi-opaque. They were harder to apply to bare skin, as they didn‚Äôt want to stick, and only one shade performed decently. It‚Äôs yet another palette that reminds me of why Dior‚Äôs palettes are a ‚Äúlook but don‚Äôt touch‚Äù situation more often than not. Dior palettes are best at inspiring me to try a new color combination, but I should know better by now to create it with anything but Dior‚Äôs own palette.",D+
HOURGLASS,MONOCHROME,Palette,"called the ‚Äúrose ‚Äù palette for its mix of pinks. It‚Äôs a sheerer set of shades that, while very soft and finely-milled, were powdery, prone to blending away into nothingness. Three of the shades are matte, while one is a low-level sheen satin and another is a frost. I think they should have skipped the frost here, as it didn‚Äôt play nicely with the others due to having a slightly thicker, dense texture so it looked more textured and thicker on the lid as a result.",C-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,HI-FI FILTER,Palette,"a highlighter and contouring powder. The lighter shade is supposed to ‚Äúsubtly illuminate,‚Äù while the darker shade ‚Äúoffers sheer shadow to define.‚Äù There are three variations in the formula, and this appears to be the darkest of the three. The texture of both sides was incredibly finely-milled and smooth, while the highlighter was a smidgen powdery, neither looked powdery on the skin. The compact is incredibly large but thin, and the lid seemed extraordinarily thin as it tapered towards the edge, which made it seem almost flimsy along the edge (where it clasps together).",A-
HOURGLASS,EXPOSURE,Palette,"a real mix in regards to quality with one spectacular miss that really brings down any chance the palette had at a decent score. If that one shade had performed even average, this palette would be closer to a B+ in rating. This set of shades was less powdery compared to the other palettes I‚Äôve reviewed with this formula. It still tended to apply more easily and wear longer when applied damp, though.",C+
GUERLAIN,PEACH SATIN (540),Lipstick,"a softened, medium tangerine orange with fine gold pearl and a luminous sheen.",B+
ESTEE LAUDER,CHROME,Eyeliner,"a medium silver with a metallic sheen. It had so-so color payoff in a single stroke that was buildable to semi-opaque coverage in two to three layers. It glided on but seemed a little waxy. It lasted for nine hours on me, which is shy of the 12-hours promised.",B-
ESTEE LAUDER,GOLD,Eyeliner,"a medium, yellow gold with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in one pass, and it was fairly buildable, but the consistency was a little too waxy so it didn‚Äôt build to fully opaque coverage. It lasted for nine and a half hours on me.",B
ESTEE LAUDER,PEARL,Eyeliner,"a light white gold with warm, yellow tones and a metallic sheen. It had semi-sheer color payoff and was rather waxy, so it was difficult to build up an even layer of color. It lasted for nine hours on me.",D+
ESTEE LAUDER,PINK GOLD,Eyeliner,"a golden copper with warm undertones and a frosted finish. The color payoff was semi-sheer to semi-opaque, and it wasn‚Äôt buildable to much more than that. On me, the color wore well for nine hours before thinning noticeably.",C+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,FIRST TIME (09),Lipstick,"a light-medium pinky-peach with a satin finish. This was a limited edition color, and likely the only way to find it is if your local store happens to still have one stashed away. As pretty as this color is, it was the type of finish that I feel is more unforgiving and definitely benefits from a full lip prep routine (the majority of shades in the formula didn‚Äôt feel that way). It lasts for five hours, but it pulls into lip lines after three and a half hours (you can even see how it seems more attracted to my lip lines upon initial application). The more velvety texture doesn‚Äôt cling, so you can smooth it out as you wear it, but it is a little drying.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,BLACK DAHLIA (10),Lipstick,"a cool-toned, burgundy with strong red tones and a semi-matte finish. It was semi-opaque and pulled into lip lines from the get-go. There was more slip in this shade than others in the range, but it wasn‚Äôt that emollient, even though it still seemed to have similar issues as many burgundies do. It lasted for six hours and left behind a stain, and it wasn‚Äôt drying (nor hydrating). I think this one needs to be applied with a lip brush and over a lip liner to perform well. This is also a limited edition shade, but it is still available at Neiman Marcus.",C+
HOURGLASS,COLOR FIELD,Palette,"a mix of beige, gold, brown, and green. It had more shimmery shades than most of the other variations, and in general, the shimmery shades have outperformed the more matte ones for me. It seemed promising when I swatched it, but when I applied to the lid, I really struggled to get even, pigmented color that stayed in place. I would apply the medium green to my lid, then apply the shade next to it, and it would look faded by the time I finished blending! I ended up going over every shade damp, because it was a complete and utter mess dry: patchy, uneven, sheer. I tested it applied dry as well as applied damp, and it‚Äôs more usable damp and lasts longer that way, but it was frustrating to use it dry. Even when I applied the eyeshadows with a damp brush (except the beige, which is matte), the texture and finish still end up looking a little dry/powdery, especially with the darkest green in the palette.",B-
HOURGLASS,ATMOSPHERE,Palette,"a warm-toned set of neutrals that range from beige to mid-tone brown to darker taupe-brown. The brand actually listed this as a cool-toned palette, but four of the five shades seemed rather warm-toned. The problems I‚Äôve had with previously reviewed versions of the formula persisted in this one. The way these look on my skin is often dry, and I have fairly normal skin on my eyes, though they can lean dry occasionally. That being said, I don‚Äôt think my skin was dry when I used these; I had just done a look prior with other eyeshadows and didn‚Äôt have any issues with the area looking dry, powdery, or flaky. When I applied this palette, it made the texture look worse. When I did a look with other eyeshadows after these, no issues! It‚Äôs like that matte, dry lipstick that makes your lips look worse no matter how much you prep beforehand.",B-
NARS,VALHALLA,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúsoft shimmering pink peach.‚Äù It‚Äôs a pop of golden peach with a frosted sheen. It doesn‚Äôt read very pink against my skin tone, but it might if you have stronger pink undertones (though even in the pan, it seems more peach thank pink).",B+
GUERLAIN,ANGELIC RADIANCE,Blush,"Äúfuchsia that revives the natural color of the cheeks, an iridescent champagne that illuminates the curve of the cheekbones and a rose petal pink that gently refreshed the complexion.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, subtly warm-toned pink with a satin finish and a subtle sparkle strewn through a few of the pearls.",B+
MAYBELLINE,BLUSHING PETAL (505),Lipgloss,"a sheer, pink-tinted gloss with fine white shimmer. It‚Äôs very, very sheer and adds mostly shimmer. It goes on fairly evenly and wears for two hours on me. I really am surprised Maybelline didn‚Äôt make it a point to offer these up as a sheerer counterpoint to their regular Color Elixir range, because these have little in common with the original range. They have a fairly strong perfume/soap-like taste and a sweeter, more creme brulee-like scent.",D+
MAYBELLINE,ENTHRALLING NUDE (500),Lipgloss,"a peach-tinted base with lighter peach shimmer. It is quite sheer (nowhere near the color payoff that‚Äôs described), though it goes on smoothly and has a pretty sparkle to it. It lasts two and a half hours on me and was lightly hydrating over time.",C-
MAYBELLINE,PEARLESCENT PEACH (520),Lipgloss,"a semi-sheer, peachy-coral with warm undertones and fine gold shimmer. It had semi-sheer color coverage that applied fairly evenly and was comfortable to wear. The gloss lasted for three hours on me. It‚Äôs nowhere near the coverage Maybelline markets the formula as having, though. If you like sheerer glosses and aren‚Äôt sensitive to taste (the Color Elixirs have a strong soap-like/perfume-like taste), it might be worth considering.",C
MAYBELLINE,GLISTENING CORAL (525),Lipgloss,"a brightened, medium orange with very subtle gold pearl. As it is semi-sheer, the natural lip color will influence how this looks on‚Äìfor me, it looks more coral (stronger pink) than orange. It lasted for two and a half hours and could have applied a bit more evenly.",C
MAYBELLINE,LUST FOR MAUVE (535),Lipgloss,"a rosy plum with warm undertones and beige and mauve shimmer. It had semi-sheer color coverage where a lot of the natural lip color is visible, but it did add noticeable color and shimmer when I applied it. This shade wore well for four hours.",B-
GUERLAIN,LES NUEES (18),Palette,"a new, limited edition cooler-toned set of shades. I felt like the color combination really needed another mid-tone or medium-dark shade, because the three lighter shades tended to muddy together, while the navy blue was almost too dark and harsh in comparison. The color payoff varied from shade to shade, and none of the shades wore particularly well on me as most were prone to fading.",C+
KAT VON D,BAUHAU5,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep raspberry.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium-dark raspberry pink with cool undertones and an extremely matte finish. The finish is what makes it harder to dupe.",A
GUERLAIN,ROSY SILK,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúsilky pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a soft, light-medium pink with warm undertones, gold shimmer, and a luminous finish.",B-
MAYBELLINE,ROSE RUSH (735),Lipstick,"a brightened, coral-red with warm undertones and a luminous finish. It had mostly opaque with a light layer of translucency, so the natural lip color will peek through. The consistency was lightweight, emollient, and comfortable to wear as it was lightly hydrating and didn‚Äôt settle into lip lines. It wore well for four and a half hours on me.",A-
MAYBELLINE,CORAL BURST (740),Lipstick,"a lightly brightened pink-coral with warm undertones and a light sheen. It had nearly full color coverage, but it had a very lightly translucent look to it as well. On me, the color lasted for four hours and was hydrating while worn.",A-
MAYBELLINE,PEACH POPPY (745),Lipstick,"a light-medium pink-peach with warm undertones and a luminous finish. It looks warmer and more peach-toned swatched, but because it isn‚Äôt fully opaque, it seemed to look pinker applied. It didn‚Äôt go on quite as evenly as one might like, though it wasn‚Äôt as streaky as light shades can be. On me, this shade wore well for three and a half hours.",B
URBAN DECAY,SHEER SLOWBURN,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúsheer orange-red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, orange-red with warm undertones and a light sheen. It had semi-opaque to mostly opaque pigmentation‚Äìyou can see my lip freckle slightly, but it is one of the more pigmented shades in the range. It has a thinner feel and doesn‚Äôt look as ‚Äúheavy‚Äù on in comparison to the original Revolution formula, but it did seem too pigmented relative to the positioning of this formula. It wore well for four and a half hours.",A-
URBAN DECAY,SHEER F-BOMB,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúsheer red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, pinky-red with subtle cool undertones and a light shine. It looked almost warm-toned against my skin tone, but I think it will lean pinker on cooler complexions. It had semi-opaque color payoff that covered evenly for the most part and glided on easily. The color wore well for five hours on me.",A-
URBAN DECAY,SHEER SHAME,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúsheer berry.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, cool-toned berry red with a light shine. It had semi-opaque color payoff, but it applied unevenly and looked splotchy at times. It wore well for four and a half hours.",B-
COLOUR POP,BUTTON,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúpale creamy peach nude [with a satin finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, pink-tinged peach with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage with a lightly creamy consistency that didn‚Äôt tug or drag on the lips but doesn‚Äôt have a lot of slip, so the color wears a little longer for me (almost five hours). It was neither drying nor hydrating. The formula seems thin enough to me that if you have drier lips, it may catch on flakes/imperfections so you may want to consider prepping lips prior to applying this.",A-
COLOUR POP,ROCKET,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúsoft bright pinky coral [with a satin finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, light-medium pink with warm undertones and a satiny sheen. It was thicker and more emollient than other shades I‚Äôve tried with a ‚Äúsatin finish,‚Äù but it had the full color coverage you‚Äôd expect from it. It applied easily as it glided over lips without dragging, and it covered evenly. On me, this shade wore well for five hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
COLOUR POP,BRILLS,Lipstick,"a ‚Äútrue cool toned lavender [with a satin finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium pink lavender with cool undertones and a satin finish‚Äìit‚Äôs pretty much exactly as described. The consistency was lightly creamy with enough slip that it glided over lips without tugging or dragging, and it was comfortable to both wear and apply. I didn‚Äôt have any issues getting a smoother, even edge when applying directly from the tube either. It wore well for four and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
COLOUR POP,FETCH,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúperfect mid-tone warm pink [with a satin finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium pink with very subtle warm tones. It almost looks cool-toned on me at times. It had full color coverage and went on evenly, though the texture was drier than Brills so I found it a little drying at the end of wear. The texture of the product doesn‚Äôt feel dry or stiff, so there‚Äôs no dragging during application. All in all, the color wore well for four and a half hours.",A-
COLOUR POP,GRIND,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúvivid blue violet in a matte finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, brightened violet purple with magenta tones and a satin finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage with a lightweight consistency that was just creamy enough not to be stiff or drag on the lips, but it doesn‚Äôt glide on effortlessly. The color wears like iron‚Äìlasting at least as long as six hours‚Äìbut is a little drying towards the last two hours. I would highly recommend making sure your lips are smooth prior to applying this, as it may catch on imperfections.",A-
COLOUR POP,LEATHER,Lipstick,"Ca ‚Äúdeep blackened violet in a matte finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a deepened, purpled berry with subtle, magenta tones and a satiny sheen. It‚Äôs not really matte, and the formula is noticeably more emollient than shades like Grind, which have more of a satin-matte finish. It had good color payoff, but it wasn‚Äôt opaque and will let the natural lip color come through. It could have applied more evenly, but at least it lasted for six hours and left a stain behind. It was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
COLOUR POP,WET,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúcool-toned taupe gunmetal in a pearlized finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a deepened, olive-toned bronze-brown‚Äìmore brown than taupe to my eye‚Äìwith a metallic sheen. It‚Äôs a very interseting color, but it applies terribly as it catches on imperfections I never knew I even had, and it tended to sink into lip lines over time. The color went on unevenly and was drying over time. It stayed on well for four and a half hours.",C
COLOUR POP,BUNNY,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúrich emerald green with small flecks of emerald glitter in a pearlized finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark green with subtle, warm yellow undertones and cooler-toned, emerald green shimmer. It had smei-opaque color coverage that went on more evenly than expected, but it was a little streaky and uneven in places due to the more emollient consistency. It lasted for five hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B
COLOUR POP,CHARM,Lipstick,"a ‚Äútrue mid-tone minty green in a satin finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, light-medium aqua green with warm undertones and a satin finish. The consistency is creamy with a little slip, but it doesn‚Äôt slide around, and this shade had mostly opaque color coverage but could have been more pigmented (not quite full coverage as promised). It pulled into lip lines after two and a half hours and worsened until removed with a total wear time of four hours. It‚Äôs definitely a shade that would likely benefit from the matching lip liner available through the brand (I don‚Äôt have it)",B
COLOUR POP,RAW,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúclean aqua blue shade with a satin finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, aqua blue with cool undertones and a satin finish. It had mostly full color coverage, but it didn‚Äôt go on perfectly evenly or smoothly. The texture seemed a little thinner with more slip, which gave it some streakiness. Again, I think picking up the matching lip pencil for this shade might be necessary to really make this sing. It settled slightly into lip lines after three and a half hours, but the higher slip in the formula made it easier to press lips together and smooth the color out again. It lasted for four and a half hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B-
CHANEL,INSAISISSABLE (152),Lipstick,"a ‚Äúvivid coral.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium coral with warm, orange undertones and a soft sheen. It had semi-opaque color coverage that applied evenly, but I thought the texture was a little thin and not quite stiff, but not creamy either. It was lightly drying over the five hours it lasted on me, unfortunately.",B
CHANEL,BADINE (154),Lipstick,"a ‚Äúlight pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, slightly muted pink with subtle, warm undertones and a light shine. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that went on fairly evenly. The texture was more emollient than Insaisissable, but I felt like this one bunched up in places as I applied‚Äìalmost as if it was catching on flakes I didn‚Äôt know I had (but I don‚Äôt really see what I felt in the close-up image). This shade lasted for four hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B-
SEPHORA,SHIMMERING MARSALA,Palette,"a limited edition set of two blushes and a highlighter. This year‚Äôs trio is definitely worth considering from the Color of the Year collection, as much like last year, it‚Äôs pretty good overall (could wear a little longer) with good color payoff, soft, blendable textures, and has good value. It‚Äôs a warm-toned set of shades, so if you prefer cooler-tones, you might check out some of the dupes listed.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,RORY,Lipstick,"a heavily gold-shimmered peach with a metallic finish. The underlying base color is more of a light, peachy-nude, but there is a lot of gold shimmer in it, which takes center stage. This one applied poorly, as it tended to bunch up on itself and looked chunky‚Äìinstead of lips looking smoother, they looked rough. It had semi-opaque color payoff, but it‚Äôs something that is probably better mixed or layered with another lip product. It lasted for three hours on me and was lightly drying.",D
TOM FORD BEAUTY,DIEGO,Lipstick,"a brightened, coral-red with warm, orange undertones and a luminous sheen. It had mostly opaque pigmentation, but there‚Äôs a veil of translucency apparent that will let the natural lip color come through slightly. The consistency had some slip, but it didn‚Äôt feather or bleed on me over the six hours it lasted. I found the formula on this shade to be a bit hydrating.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,ALEJANDRO,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, fuchsia-red with cool, blue undertones and a very fine shimmer. It had semi-opaque color coverage, which went on evenly and looked smooth on the lips, but the natural lip color will come through. It lasted for six hours and was hydrating while worn. Alejandro is the same as Slander.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,HOLDEN,Lipstick,"a light golden beige with warmer gold shimmer that gives it a more frosted finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, but it applied unevenly and tended to settle into lip lines over time. This didn‚Äôt feel as smooth on the lips as other shades in the range. I found it a little drying over the three hours it lasted on me. For reference, this is the same as Vanilla Suede.",C-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,BEAU,Lipstick,"a pinky-peach beige with subtle, warmer undertones and a satin finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage that went on evenly (which is more impressive, given the creaminess and lightness of this particular shade). On me, the color wore well for four hours and was hydrating over time. For reference, this is the same shade as Blush Nude.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,HENRY,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark orange-brown with lighter gold micro-shimmer. It had rich color payoff that covered the lips with smooth, even color while being easy to apply. It was hydrating over the five hours it wore on me. For reference, this is the same shade as Warm Sable. The finer shimmer in this made it harder to dupe.",A
MAC,TOUCH THE EARTH,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúlight wood brown.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, light-medium beige-brown with warm, yellow undertones and a soft shine.",B+
MAC,NATURAL VIGOR,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúshimmery champagne peach.‚Äù MAC described the finish as ‚Äúhalf pearl/half frost.‚Äù It seems less like a duo differentiated by finish and more like a traditional duo with one lighter and one darker shade, though they‚Äôre both in the same color family.",B+
MAC,FORCE OF NATURE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúshimmery brown [with a half pearl/half frost finish].‚Äù I really liked one side, but the other side was drier and sparkly enough where it was prone to fall out.",B-
MAC,PLEASE YOURSELF,Blush,"a ‚Äúlight pink with plum marble.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark pink with cool undertones and silver sparkle and finer silver shimmer.",B-
TARTE,CELEBRATED,Blush,a dusty pink with neutral-to-warm undertones and a semi-matte finish.,B
REVLON,HD CITRINE (550),Lipgloss,"a bright orange with warm, reddish tones and lighter yellow gold shimmer. It had rich, opaque color payoff that covered ths lips well with even, smooth color. This shade lasted for almost six hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
REVLON,HD AMBER (555),Lipgloss,"a muted orange-copper with orange and gold shimmer. Despite having a similar texture to other shades in the range, it was rather sheer‚Äìat most, semi-sheer‚Äìbut the base color didn‚Äôt seem to do much. It lasted for three and a half hours. It could also have gone on more evenly, but luckily, the shimmer distracted the eye from some of the unevenness.",C-
REVLON,HD SUNSTONE (565),Lipgloss,"a brightened, medium coral-orange with warm undertones and finer light gold pearl. It had full color coverage that went on fairly evenly and smoothly. Some of the color pulled slightly into lip lines, but the high-shine finish helped to minimize the appearance. The gloss wore well for five hours on me.",A-
KAT VON D,INNERSTELLAR,Palette,"most notable as being a more cool-toned palette in what feels like a neverending sea of warm-toned palettes. It‚Äôs decent to good, but a few shades were troublesome to wear on bare skin as they didn‚Äôt adhere as well and tended to look faded and uneven. Some shades wore for six hours, others wore for a full eight. The texture of the eyeshadows, on the whole, was soft, finely-milled, and smooth. There were a couple that were a little powdery, but some were really easy to work with. For me, it was a bit of a mixed bag, and that always leaves me feeling lukewarm. I think if you use a white base or a good primer, it has potential, but it was a lot like Chrysalis in terms of how it felt and applied. I would have loved to see less mid-tone browns in this palette (perhaps a cool beige as one and a deeper brown).",B+
MAC,RED OBSESSED,Blush,"a ‚Äúsoft rose.‚Äù It was a light-medium, pink-coral with warm undertones and a soft, golden frosted finish and a natural sheen.",B
TOM FORD BEAUTY,STAVROS,Lipstick,"a muted, dark taupe with mauve and cool undertones and a frosted finish. It had rich pigmentation that covered the lips evenly. The consistency was creamy and glided over lips easily. This shade lasted for five hours on me and was moisturizing over time.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,JULIAN,Lipstick,"a cool-toned, muted, medium-dark pink with a lilac tone to it and a luminous finish. It had mostly opaque pigmentation that covered the lips evenly and hugged for longer-than-average wear but didn‚Äôt feel clingy. The formula was lightly creamy, comfortable to wear, hydrating, and lasted for five hours on me. NARS Anna (P, $32.00) is darker. MAC Vivid Imagination (LE, $16.00) is lighter. Le Metier de Beaute Fiji (P, $32.00) is darker, brighter. See comparison swatches / view dupes.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,ADDISON,Lipstick,"a medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage that went on fairly evenly. I think the texture could have been slightly smoother overall, though. This shade wore well for four and a half hours and was hydrating while worn. Addison is the same as Pink Dusk, which was previously released.",A-
MAC,SECRET ADMIRER,Blush,"a ‚Äúcoral pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium coral-pink with warm undertones and a luminous sheen.",B
MAKEUP GEEK,MAGIC ACT,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúlight gold with yellow undertones.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium gold with warm, yellow-orange undertones and a metallic sheen. There‚Äôs a slightly muted quality to the color, so it doesn‚Äôt read true gold. It had good pigmentation with a buttery, dense texture that went on smoothly and was very blendable. It started to crease after seven hours of wear.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,JESTER,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúbright mossy green with slight gold undertones.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, yellowed green with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had fairly good color payoff with a silky, creamy consistency that went on smoothly. This shade started to crease after seven hours of wear.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,HOUDINI,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúdeep emerald teal green.‚Äù It‚Äôs a cool-toned, blackened teal with a metallic sheen. It had a slightly drier consistency that made it more to flaking in the pan (but it doesn‚Äôt flake off once applied, to be clear), and as a result, the pigmentation wasn‚Äôt as strong. It lost a lot of the richness/intensity of the teal color and looked more like a muted version of itself applied. Once on, the color showed signs of creasing after seven and a half hours of wear.",B
MAKEUP GEEK,CENTER STAGE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúbright royal blue.‚Äù It‚Äôs a rich, navy blue with a hint of violet/purple and a metallic finish. It had really good color payoff with a fairly soft, smooth consistency. It felt a little drier/less creamy compared to the other shades in the range, and it didn‚Äôt seem to apply as easily as the other shades. This shade started to crease after seven and a half hours of wear.",B+
CHRISTIAN LOUBATIN,NI TOI NI MOI,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúmint green.‚Äù It‚Äôs a lightly brightened, medium-dark green-teal with a cream finish.",A
MAC,BARE ASSET,Eyeliner,"a ‚Äúmedium beige.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, peachy orange with warm, yellow undertones and a satin finish. It had good pigmentation in a single pass, and it was buildable to mostly opaque color coverage. The texture was creamy without being too waxy, so it applied smoothly. This shade wore well for seven and a half hours on me.",A-
MAC,RISQUE,Eyeliner,"a ‚Äúpale beige.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, yellowed beige with warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage in one stroke, which was buildable to mostly opaque color with two layers. Like Bare Asset, it was creamy without being too waxy or too emollient, and it also wore well for seven and a half hours.",B+
MAC,SNOWED IN,Eyeliner,"a ‚Äúlight peach off-white.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, warm white with a metallic sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation when applied in a fluid stroke, and it was slightly buildable but wasn‚Äôt fully opaque no matter how many layers I attempted to apply. This shade stayed on well for seven hours before fading.",B
MAC,ARMY STYLE,Eyeliner,"a ‚Äúmilitary deep green.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, dark olive green with subtle, warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It was drier, somewhat stiff, yet waxy, and the resulting color payoff was sheer. At best, it was semi-sheer, but it looked so unevenly when layered. It had faded after six hours of wear.",F
MAC,SOURPUSS,Eyeliner,"an ‚Äúacid green.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened chartreuse green with warm, yellow undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-sheer pigmentation in a single pass, and it was slightly buildable but the color tended to bunch up in places, so it wasn‚Äôt as even as I‚Äôd like. The consistency was a bit stiffer than other shades, too, which made it less pleasant to apply. The color started to fade after six and a half hours. I couldn‚Äôt think of any dupes for this.",C-
MAC,AUDACIOUS,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúwarm mid-tone red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium red with warm undertones and a soft sheen. It had mostly opaque color payoff that went on evenly, smoothly, and wore well for five hours. It was lightly hydrating over time. The consistency was lightweight, emollient without being too slippery.",A
MAC,RAVISHINGLY RICH,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright mid-tone orange.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium orange with a lighter, tangerine micro-shimmer and luminous finish. It was creamy and comfortable to wear with rich, opaque color coverage. This shade lasted well for four and a half hours and was lightly moisturizing while worn.",A
KEVYN AUCOIN,TROPICAL DAYS,Bronzer,"a medium, golden brown with a hint of gray‚Äìthere‚Äôs an almost ‚Äúdirty‚Äù aspect to the color‚Äìand a shimmery, luminous finish.",A
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,FALLEN ANGEL,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette that uses a different formula than her other palettes. It is a wet/dry formula that‚Äôs supposed to have a ‚Äúrich and buildable layer of color‚Äù when applied dry with ‚Äúthree times the color intensity and ‚Ä¶ [a] metal reflective finish‚Äù when applied damp. The palette is really easy to work with, and the four shades performed well consistently with good color payoff, soft, blendable textures, and long-wear (eight hours). It is true that the color is more buildable (or sheer-able) if you use it dry, whereas a damp brush will yield very opaque results with (seemingly) less product, though both application methods yielded richer color payoff without fuss. Ultimately, applying the shades with a dampened brush does seem to give slightly richer color with more depth and a stronger sheen, but it is a subtle difference‚Äìnot three times the intensity (I think the third shade had the ‚Äúbiggest‚Äù difference, while the first had the least) and not all were metallic when damp. It‚Äôs a really lovely palette if you like your warmer, smokier neutrals with a lot of shimmer, but you may want to check your stash for dupes first as these were more dupable shades.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,GRAPHITE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúlight graphite grey with flecks of silver.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark gray with subtle, warm undertones and a frosted finish. It had good color payoff, which could have been truer-to-pan, but it had a soft, blendable consistency so it was easy to use on the lid. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,ICE QUEEN,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúfrosty shimmery white.‚Äù It‚Äôs a cool-toned, bright white with a very fine shimmer-sheen finish. It‚Äôs somewhat powdery, but it had decent pigmentation nonetheless. This shade lasted for seven and a half hours when I tested it.",B
MAKEUP GEEK,WHITE LIES,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúmatte pure white.‚Äù It‚Äôs a cool-toned white with a matte finish that comes off looking almost gray-ish applied. I think it‚Äôs a shade that would be really nice over a good base for a pure white, but it doesn‚Äôt have the density or richness to be bright white on the skin by itself. It showed signs of fading after seven and a half hours of wear.",B-
IT COSMETICS,MAGICAL IN MAUVE,Blush,"a rich, brightened, berry-purple with cool undertones and a soft, frosted finish.",A+
REVLON,HD TOURMALINE (510),Lipgloss,"a bright, fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a white sparkle. It had mostly opaque color coverage, which applied fairly evenly, but it could have gone on better. It wore well for five hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
REVLON,HD PINK RUBY (515),Lipgloss,"a bold, brightened pinky-red with fuchsia shimmer and sparkle. It had rich, opaque color coverage that went on evenly and lasted for six hours.",A
REVLON,HD CARNELIAN (545),Lipgloss,"a muted, medium-dark burgundy red with subtle, cool undertones and a creamy finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage with a high-shine finish. It applied beautifully and evenly, except along the edges due to the bristles of the brush (be very slow and methodical when applying with the applicator!). It wore well for five and a half hours.",A
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,IBIZA NIGHTS,Lipgloss,"a sheer, golden beige base with lighter gold and copper shimmer. It is a gloss that it is primarily sparkle and shimmer. While it‚Äôs a sparkly, pretty gloss, it doesn‚Äôt seem to be in line with how the formula is described. Charlotte Tilbury describes it as hydrating and non-sticky with ‚Äúun-adulterated colour‚Äù and six-hour wear. It‚Äôs is significantly less pigmented compared to Sweet Stiletto, which I reviewed previously, and the other shade mentioned in this post. This one lasted for four hours on me, and it was slightly tacky. It was somewhat hydrating over time.",B-
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,BARDOT BEIGE,Lipgloss,"a light, peachy beige with warm undertones and a creamy finish. This shade had semi-opaque color payoff, but the lighter, milkier base did result in some settling into lip lines. The thinner consistency of the gloss kept it from looking really dismal, but it‚Äôs a shade that will perform better over a lip liner or lipstick for additional glossiness, shine, or to lighten. It did apply better than many other shades of this lightness. It wore well for four hours on me and was lightly hydrating over time.",B
TARTE,TARTELETTE,Palette,"twelve matte eyeshadows ranging from yellowed beige to deep black. The majority of the palette is closer to neutral in tone than really cool- or warm-toned, though some shades lean cooler/warmer. The majority of the shades felt soft and silky with a few being a smidgen powdery, but I found these less powdery on the whole compared to other Tarte matte eyeshadows. Some wore for eight hours, while a few were faster to fade. I only had major issues with one shade (Best Friend), but the other shades were fairly easy to work with.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,S718 SALMON,Blush,a light-medium peach with a hint of beige‚Äìthere‚Äôs a muted quality there‚Äìand warm undertones with a satin finish.,A
KAT VON D,L.U.V.,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúrich violet.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, magenta purple with warmer, pink tones but an overall cooler undertone and an ultra-matte finish.",A-
MAC,SATIN OCHRE,Palette,"a mix of beige and coral. It‚Äôs part of the collaboration with Prabal Gurung, which will launch online on November 20th (in select stores on the 26th). One shade was really nice to work with, while the other needed improvement. At this price point, both shades should hit it out of the park. I also wish these were the equivalent of two full-sized eyeshadows.",B
MAC,CARMINE ROUGE,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúclean true red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, neutral red with a creamy, glossy finish. It seems to almost look warm on me, which is often how neutral reds look on my coloring, so it may appear more neutral or even subtly cool-toned depending on your undertones. It had mostly opaque color coverage with a fairly smooth, even application. The texture is slightly thick, tacky, but holds on well and lasts for five hours. It was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
MAC,ULTRAMARINE PINK,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúmid-tone dirty violet.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, brightened magenta plum with cool undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. It was mostly opaque and applied verly evenly. The consistency is on the thicker side with a noticeable amount of tackiness. This shade lasted for five hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating over time.",A
BURBERRY,GOLD GLOW NO. 01,Highlighter,"a dirty, light-medium antique gold with a frosted sheen.",A+
BITE BEAUTY,BRANDY,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúmuted raspberry.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, pinky-red with warm undertones and a soft shine. It had mostly opaque color payoff, and the color applied evenly and smoothly with just a smidgen of shine initially (it wore away within an hour). The color itself lasted for five and a half hours on me, and the formula was comfortable and hydrating.",A
BITE BEAUTY,SUCRE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúwarm pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a pink-coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had rich, full color coverage that applied beautifully with smooth, even color. This shade wore well for five hours and was moderately moisturizing over time.",A
BITE BEAUTY,TATIN,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúrose pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and a luminous finish. It had rich color payoff with a lightly creamy, comfortable-to-wear formula that applied evenly. This shade lasted for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating while worn.",A
MAC,CORAL LUMINEUX,Blush,"a ‚Äúvivid coral creme.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium coral-orange with warm undertones and a satin finish.",A-
ESTEE LAUDER,RECKLESS,Lipstick,"a slightly muted, pink-berry with cool undertones and a soft, luminous sheen.",A
TARTE,SWEET INDULGENCES,Palette,"a three-piece set, where there are three, slim square boxes that are designed to be given as gifts. You can keep them all for yourself, break the set up, or gift the entire thing. One box contains two blushes and three lip colors, another with three eyeliners and two mascaras, and a third with two eyeshadow palettes (eight shades in each). Overall, I think the Lip Cremes and the Eyeshadows are the stars, but the rest leaves me unimpressed: one blush was a complete miss (worst product in the set), while the three eyeliners were rougher, drier formula. Some of the eyeshadows are very nice, others are sheerer and don‚Äôt perform as well. I noticed the eyeshadow formula seemed thinner in this palette across the board, which made a lot of shades seem less powdery, but some were under-pigmented. There‚Äôs plenty of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù to the set, but I think it just depends on what you wanted most.",B-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,GONE BAD (216),Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúcoral red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, bright coral-orange with warm undertones and a glossy finish.",A
MAKEUP GEEK,NEPTUNE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúmatte bright blue.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, cornflower blue with a matte finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff with a very soft, but somewhat powdery, consistency that is better if applied over a slightly tacky base. I would recommend patting in layers and only blending the edges, or else it is prone to sheering out. It wears for seven and a half hours before fading.",B-
MAKEUP GEEK,PEACOCK,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúmatte deep teal blue.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark bluish-teal with a mostly matte finish. It had decent color payoff, but the texture was soft and powdery enough that it doesn‚Äôt adhere well to bare skin. It will deliver better results with some sort of primer, as it won‚Äôt sheer away as easily. It lasted for almost eight hours before fading on me.",B-
MAKEUP GEEK,SEA MIST,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúshimmering turquoise.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, dirty green-teal with a satin finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff, while the consistency was soft, blendable, and fairly easy to work with. The color showeed signs of fading after eight hours of wear.",B+
FORMULA X,INFAMOUS,NailPolish,a ‚Äúteal and purple metallic.‚Äù It‚Äôs a steely gray that leans slightly teal along the edges and shifts to a muted violet. It has more of a metallic shimmer running through it.,A-
CHANEL,SWEET STAR,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúmetallic silver ‚Ä¶ [with] an iridescent glow.‚Äù On the nail, it‚Äôs a deepened gray with a green and blue cast‚Äìit gives off a greener, more pewter-ish hue along the center of each nail, while the edges are smokier with a bluish-purple hue. At an angle, it can turn almost bluish-silver.",B+
CHANEL,BERRY LUCKY,Eyeliner,"a brightened, fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a subtle, pearled sheen. It had semi-opaque color payoff in a single stroke, and this was the more buildable shade of the three.",C+
CHANEL,COCORANGE,Eyeliner,"a brightened, medium-dark orange with reddish undertones and a satin finish. It never built up to more than semi-opaque color‚Äìthere was a translucency to it so that parts of it appeared redder and other parts appeared more tangerine and yellowed. It‚Äôs a very unique color as far as I can tell, though.",C-
CHANEL,SWEET STAR,Eyeliner,"a muted, bluish teal with a soft, frosted finish. It had semi-sheer pigmentation in one stroke, and it was only buildable to semi-opaque color. Again, it looked somewhat uneven when built up.",D+
BOBBI BROWN,BRONZE GLOW,Highlighter,a coppery bronze with warm undertones and a golden sheen.,A
LAURA MERCIER,HOLIDAY 2014,Palette,"eight eyeshadows and one cheek color. The eyeshadows lean slightly cool-toned overall, but the cheek color is really warm, and I felt like it didn‚Äôt complement the eyeshadows well. Nearly all of the eyeshadows in the palette were slightly powdery, with the more shimmery shades having a dry, powdery consistency, whereas the mattes were silky and soft and a wee bit powdery (but better than stiff). Most of the eyeshadows lasted for eight hours, while the blush wore well for seven and a half hours on me. This palette is exclusive to Sephora.",B+
ANASTASIA,TAMANNA,Palette,"ten eyeshadows that range from warm beige to bluish-teal to cranberry to taupe. This is one of the better Anastasia palettes I‚Äôve come across, as the eyeshadows were more consistent in texture and payoff‚Äìthey weren‚Äôt as dry as past palettes I‚Äôve tried from the brand. All except one shade wore well for eight hours, and there was really only shade that was a bit of a let-down (but not a total miss).",A-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,THE PARISIENNE,Palette,"a new, limited edition holiday palette that runs very cool-toned. It‚Äôs always nice to see a more cool-toned palette, since they‚Äôre not as common as you might think (and most, like this one, are limited edition). Overall, it‚Äôs a nice palette with cooler, smokier shades that run from deep gray to soft white. Two shades had slightly drier textures, but most shades had good color payoff, long-wear, and were blendable on the skin.",A-
KAT VON D,STUDDED KISS,Palette,"nine, mini-sized shades from the permanent range (all of them can be had individually, if desired). Overall, I didn‚Äôt find that the formula of the minis to be different from the full-sized shades I have. The formula is a drier, stiffer consistency that often drags and tugs on the lips. Some of the lighter shades look almost chalky on, while some of the more red-hued mattes seem to be least problematic. The shimmery shades are usually creamier, but they tend to be less pigmented. The brand claims that these will ‚Äúcomfortably coat lips with bold color for 10 hours‚Äù (they even claim ‚Äúone swipe application). Wear time varies but tends to be longer than the average lipstick, though shorter than the 10-hour wear claim. I do not find the formula comfortable to wear, and it‚Äôs hard to apply color in ‚Äúone swipe‚Äù since they drag a lot. Some shades are drying, some are neither drying nor hydrating, which is far from the brand‚Äôs claim that the formula will leave ‚Äúlips feeling supple.‚Äù The caps of these come off very easily, so you may not want to carry them in your purse. Mine have just been sitting in a plastic bin, and I had problems with them coming off any time products shifted around at all (unusual‚Äìcan‚Äôt say I specifically recall this being an issue with another brand, or the full-sized versions).",C+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,PLATINUM,Eyeshadow,"a warm, smoky taupe with a frosted shimmer-sheen finish. This shade is a real chameleon, though, because it will just as readily look like a bronze as it will a cooler-toned, almost purplish-taupe. I think it‚Äôs going to look a little different from person to person, depending on the lighting and what you pair it with, as a result (more so than most shades). This shade was released previously, and it‚Äôs back again for a limited time. It‚Äôs very pigmented‚Äìa little goes a long way‚Äìand the texture is a wet, mousse-cream, so it applies really well as it goes on evenly. It‚Äôs not the type of texture I‚Äôd expect to stay on well, but on me, it lasts eight hours before creasing slightly.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,SPICE,Eyeshadow,"a warm, golden bronze with red undertones and a soft, pearly sheen. It had rich, full color coverage using very little product (use less than you think you‚Äôd need), and it blends easily on the skin. The color lasted for nine hours before creasing slightly.",A+
DIOR,GOLD RAIN (164),Lipgloss,"a sheer, white gold with light-medium gold shimmer and sparkle. It lasts for two and a half hours, though the lightweight, non-sticky, creamy consistency meant it was very comfortable and nicely hydrating during that time. The formula is supposed to be a sheerer, lightweight, hydrating, and high-shine gloss, and Dior delivers‚Äìit‚Äôs a matter of whether sheer is your thing (or not).",B
DIOR,PINK EXCESS (663),Lipgloss,"a muted, medium pink-coral with pink and gold sparkle. It had semi-sheer color coverage, but this one had more impact applied than Gold Rain, as it did noticeable tint the lips and add sparkle. It wasn‚Äôt quite as glossy, though. It lasted for three hours on me and was very hydrating over time.",A-
DIOR,GOLDEN SHOCK (001),NailPolish,"a clear top coat with gold leaf. It‚Äôs certainly fun and festive, but it requires fishing and some maneuvering to get the gold flakes to appear just-so on the nails. The cap on the Diorific polishes makes this a little more difficult, but the degree of difficulty will depend on how large your fingers are.",B
DIOR,MIRROR (022),NailPolish,"a pale, white gold with warm undertones and a very fine, metallic shimmer. Alone, it has a more pearly, white gold effect. I tried it layered over Shock (a warm red), and it made the pearl look more orange. It‚Äôs semi-sheer average two coats and has a moderately shiny dry down.",B-
DIOR,GOLD EQUINOXE (241),NailPolish,"a muted, medium-dark gold with hints of brown and fine, gold metallic shimmer. It didn‚Äôt apply evenly, and it was only semi-opaque. The consistency of this was thin, and it seemed to dry as I was applying, even though it isn‚Äôt a foil finish.",C+
DIOR,SHOCK (762),NailPolish,"a vibrant, medium red with subtle, warm undertones (almost neutral, I‚Äôd say) and a cream finish. It was opaque after two coats, and it dried down to a glossy finish without need for a top coat. The consistency wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin, and this was the best-performing shade out of the five.",A
DIOR,SMOKY (990),NailPolish,"a deep, dark, blackened purple berry with a cream finish. It was mostly opaque, but it was somewhat streaky (which was a surprise!), possibly due to the more watery formula.",B
FORMULA X,ALCHEMY,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúplatinum-infused, mixed metal shimmer.‚Äù It‚Äôs a dirty, antique gold base with silver, gold, and copper micro-glitter. It almost seemed like sparkle, because the particles seemed even finer than most micro-glitters.",A-
CHANEL,CARESSE (180),Blush,"a soft, peach-orange with white sparkle over a satin finish.",B
NYX,EARL GREY,Lipstick,"a muted, light-medium cornflower blue‚Äìa purplish-blue‚Äìwith a luminous finish. The formula was creamy with a lot of slip, but for a lighter shade, it ended up applying better than anticipated, though it was still somewhat streaky. It had mostly opaque color coverage (but if it was a drier formula, I think it would have yielded better pigmentation). On me, the color wore well for three and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B
NYX,VIOLET,Lipstick,"a medium purple with warm, pinky-red undertones and a natural finish. It had good color payoff, while the formula still felt very creamy and slippery, it applied pretty well with even color. It wore well for almost six hours, and it leaves behind a fuchsia-ish stain behind. It was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
NYX,LAVENDER,Lipstick,"a cool-toned, light-medium lavender with a creamy, lightly glossy finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which went on a bit streakily and had a tendency to settle into lip lines as it wore on. It wasn‚Äôt moisturizing, but it was drying either. The color wore well for four hours on me",B-
NYX,KEY LIME,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúcreamy and highly pigmented‚Äù formula that features more ‚Äúpastel and neon‚Äù shades. They also note it has a ‚Äúsatin matte finish‚Äù and ‚Äúlong-wearing resilience.‚Äù The formula has a lot of slip to it, so it glides on and never tugs on lips, but it also had a tendency to go on somewhat unevenly (the degree dependent on the shade). The wear time for these three shades was a little longer than average. The formula was comfortable to wear, and it was neither drying nor hydrating.",B-
NYX,PISTACHIO,Lipstick,"a light, bluish-aqua with a satin finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage, and while it applied better than expected for such a creamy, emollient, and pastel shade, it was uneven at the end of the day. It might work with a lip primer (readers have suggested NYX‚Äôs own Lip Primer helps a lot) or lip pencil underneath to mitigate some of the slippery consistency of the formula. It wore well for four and a half hours.",B-
NYX,BLUE VELVET,Lipstick,"a brightened, medium-dark blue‚Äìalmost periwinkle blue to me, as there‚Äôs a soft, dusty quality to it, but it doesn‚Äôt overwhelm the color, so it still looks brighter. It had more of a luminous finish with a fair amount of shine. It applied evenly for the most part, but it wasn‚Äôt perfect in application due to the higher slip in the formula. This shade stayed on for five hours and left a stain behind.",A-
DIOR,CUIR CANNAGE (796),Palette,"a set of darker neutrals with warm undertones that range from light beige to burgundy-brown. I think it‚Äôs one of those palettes that performs better in practice as you apply and layer and blend them together than it swatches. It could use more pigmentation across the board (only one shade really nailed pigmentation), but for the most part, the eyeshadows were blendable and fairly easy to apply.",B
MAC,SMOKY,Palette,"contains three eyeshadows, two cheek products, and two lip colors housed in a medium-large sized ivory-hued palette with a strand of ‚Äúpearls‚Äù along the exterior edge of the palette. It has a mirror on the interior and a plastic flap that covers the three cream products and protects them from getting powdery bits mixed in them. I wasn‚Äôt wowed by any of the products in this particular set, unfortunately. The pearls feel flimsy‚ÄìI greatly worry about them lifting while traveling (same goes for all of the compacts like this in the collection). The palette includes: $18 worth of eyeshadow, $5.44 worth of lipstick, $15.40 worth of Cream Colour Base, and $8.63 worth of Iridescent Pressed Powder (best estimate based on last price/oz. I have, since this isn‚Äôt a formula MAC has released in a long time individually). There is also a double-ended 275/316 brush included, which adds some value. The value of the color products is $47.47 plus the brush. MAC‚Äôs pre-made face palettes always seem to be the least value-packed.",C+
MAC,PLUM EYE,Palette," a cool-toned set of shades in iridescent lavender and deep plum with a cool purple eyeliner. Both of the eyeshadows are repromotes, while the eyeliner is permanent. The eyeliner was disappointing, as it was sheer and drier. It includes an Extra Dimension eyeshadow duo (0.14 oz.), In Extreme Dimension Lash Mascara (0.44 fl. oz.), and a Powerpoint Eye Pencil (0.04 oz.). Everything in the set is full-sized, and it all fits into a small, glittery, zippered bag. In May, MAC released smaller-sized Extra Dimensions eyeshadows at $19.50/0.04 oz., whereas the duo contains 0.14 oz. in total, so there is a value of $68.25 there, plus $22 for the mascara and $16 for the eyeliner, for a total value of $106.25‚Äìso it is an excellent deal if they‚Äôre products you would use. Even if you just liked the eyeshadow duo, it is almost the same as what you would have paid on two singles (and you‚Äôll get more‚ÄìI have no idea how they managed to get more product into the compact, given they‚Äôre visually the same size as the singles).",B
MAC,SMOKY EYE,Palette,"a cool-toned set of shades in silver and gray paired with a black eyeliner. The two work together well, though the gray-black is the more unique shade of the two. It includes an Extra Dimension eyeshadow duo (0.14 oz.), In Extreme Dimension Lash Mascara (0.44 fl. oz.), and a Powerpoint Eye Pencil (0.04 oz.). Everything in the set is full-sized, and it all fits into a small, glittery, zippered bag. In May, MAC released smaller-sized Extra Dimensions eyeshadows at $19.50/0.04 oz., whereas the duo contains 0.14 oz. in total, so there is a value of $68.25 there, plus $22 for the mascara and $16 for the eyeliner, for a total value of $106.25‚Äìso it is an excellent deal if they‚Äôre products you would use.

MAC,BROWN EYE,Palette,"a nice set for anyone who‚Äôs a fan of the Extra Dimension eyeshadow formula. The duo performed well, and the included eyeliner is nice (not revolutionary, not bad)‚ÄìI would have loved to see a smokier, more taupe-hued eyeliner to pair with this, though. The set includes an Extra Dimension eyeshadow duo (0.14 oz.), In Extreme Dimension Lash Mascara (0.44 fl. oz.), and a Powerpoint Eye Pencil (0.04 oz.). Everything in the set is full-sized, and it all fits into a small, glittery, zippered bag.

As a FYI, I didn‚Äôt review (or include a rating for) the mascara.",A-
MAC,BEIGE EYES,Palette,"one of three, 8-pan eyeshadow palettes for the holidays. It has a neutral theme running through it, and the set of shades runs warm-toned. This palette was the best of the three eyeshadows palettes, though I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs great. It‚Äôs all right‚Äìthe shades themselves are more dupable than not, and without superb quality to back them up, it ends up falling in the middle.",B
MAC,SMOKY EYES,Palette,"a mix of beige, brown, and black. It‚Äôs more of a neutral palette than a monochromatic mix of silver, gray, and black. This one is also heavy on the permanent shades‚Äìfive of the eight are part of the permanent range. After the last few years of disappointing holiday palettes from MAC, it‚Äôs not a surprise to see this one perform so dismally. This one is a real skip, I would say, and even the permanent shades in it are nowhere near the performance of their full-sized, standalone versions.",C
MAC,NUDE LIP,Palette,"three, full-sized peach-hued lip products, plus a glittery bag to put them in. The set launches October 17th online and will head in stores on the 23rd (see full details here. The set contains $47 worth of products (plus the bag).",B+
MAC,RED LIP,Palette,"three, full-sized red-hued lip products, plus a glittery bag to put them in. The set launches October 17th online and will head in stores on the 23rd (see full details here. The set contains $47 worth of products (plus the bag). Though I love the color of Ruby Woo (a very classic red), it is drying on me over time, so you may want to carefully prep lips and be aware that you may need a little balm beforehand. Topping with the gloss helps to mitigate some of the drying qualities of the lipstick, but it had a tendency to feather after a few hours (which I don‚Äôt usually experience).",B
MAKE UP FOR EVER,STUDIO CASE,Palette,"twelve eyeshadows and an eyeliner. The eyeshadows all had good color payoff or better with soft, blendable textures that were easy to use. When the weakest performers come in at B+, you‚Äôre in good shape. I‚Äôm a big fan of the Artist Shadow formula, and in general, only the mattes have any issues (some are lovely, some could use improvement). They can be so soft that they turn powdery, which makes them harder to apply on bare skin or the color payoff is just weaker, but many of them are good, just not perfect. That was the case with the two mattes here‚Äìgood but not great‚Äìand the rest were quite nice. Most of the shades wore between eight and nine hours.",A
CHANEL,JERSEY (80),Blush,"a muted, peachy brown with subtle gold shimmer.",A-
CHANEL,CAMELIA DE PLUMES,Highlighter,"a light, almost cool-toned gold with a luminous sheen. ",A
TOO FACED,SUGAR & SPICE,Palette,"a new, limited edition, ULTA exclusive palette that features twelve eyeshadows with a glittery gold exterior. It‚Äôs a fairly good, neutral-driven eyeshadow palette with a lot of warmer shades and a variety of finishes from matte to frost. There was only shade that was a big miss (Black Licorice), but the majority had good color payoff, good to slightly powdery textures, and wore for seven to eight hours. This has sold out online, so you‚Äôll only be able to find it at a local ULTA store if you have one nearby.",B
NYX,ENVY,Lipstick,"a bluish-purple with cool undertones and a metallic finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage, and it had the same really creamy consistency as other shades in the range. This one was loaded with shimmer, which helped to camouflage some of the underlying unevenness of the color itself, so it looked fairly good in person, even if up-close isn‚Äôt 100% amazing. It wore well for six and a half hours, and it left behind an eggplant-hued stain behind.",B+
NYX,SINFUL,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark blue with a glossy finish. The consistency was creamy with a lot of slip, but it applied beautifully with rich, opaque color that went on evenly. It stayed on for six hours. It‚Äôs not metallic in its finish, though, and it has barely-there shimmer.",A
NYX,BETRAYAL,Lipstick,"a lightly brightened, medium-dark purple with subtle cool undertones and a violet shimmer. It‚Äôs not really metallic in finish‚Äìmore glossy with a faint shimmer that gets lost in it. The texture was creamy with a lot of slip, and it did show in the application, as the color didn‚Äôt go on evenly and looked streaky. This one needs a lip primer or pencil to work. It is also easier to work with if you blot it down slightly, as removing some of the slip made it stay in place better. It lasted for four and a half hours and left a fuchsia stain behind.",C+
NYX,TRICKERY,Lipstick,"a dirty, olive green with fine gold shimmer for a frosted, metallic finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage that applied fairly well, but there was some unevenness. The texture was creamy, surprisingly slippery, so I was actually impressed it looked as good on as it did, given how emollient the formula was. I was even more surprised that it lasted for five hours; it seemed like a lot of the slickness disappeared within an hour, and once it did, it didn‚Äôt move readily. It was neither drying nor hydrating, and it was comfortable to wear.",B+
NYX,RISQUE,Lipstick,"a rich, emerald green with metallic green shimmer. It had mostly opaque color coverage, and again, the formula felt incredibly creamy and emollient, yet it applied a lot better than expected. There was slight unevenness, but it wasn‚Äôt noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The color wore well for almost five hours, and it left a light stain behind.",A-
NYX,SCANDALOUS,Lipstick,"a brightened, medium-dark blue-teal with a glossy, pearly finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage, but the high slip in the formula made itself quite apparent with its uneven coverage. It slides around a lot, and it is very high maintenance to wear on its own. A lip liner is a must with this one, I‚Äôd say. Alone, it lasted for three and a half hours.",D+
MAC,GOLD + BEIGE,Palette,"four pigments (each containing 0.09 oz.) and one glitter (containing 0.14 oz.). MAC‚Äôs Pigments can be a lot of fun to use, if you like loose eyeshadow, and I‚Äôve always liked them as colored eyeshadow bases. They‚Äôre actually designed as a ‚Äúhighly concentrated loose colour powder‚Äù that will ‚Äúadhere to the skin.‚Äù They can be used to ‚Äúcreate a subtle wash of colour or an intense effect.‚Äù The formula is supposed to be ‚Äúeasy to blend and long-lasting.‚Äù The majority work best when applied with a dampened brush, as it helps the powder bind and adhere to the skin, though some shades are more pigmented than others for dry application.",B+
MAC,NUDE + CORAL,Palette,"three Cremesheen Glasses and one Dazzleglass. Again, I‚Äôve reviewed these shades in the past, so this is just a quick overview with photos and swatches.",B-
NARS,DEADLY CATCH,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúcrimson.‚Äù It‚Äôs a rich, medium-dark red with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage, a light creaminess, and lasted for seven and a half hours. It was lightly hydrating while worn. I doubt it‚Äôs a real surprise that it being a medium red that there is a slew of dupes out there.",A
NARS,FEMME FLEUR,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúshimmering brick red with gold pearl.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark copper brown with warm undertones and a soft dusting of gold shimmer. It had mostly opaque color payoff, which went on evenly and smoothly. The color lasted for five hours, and it was lightly moisturizing over time.",A-
NARS,ADRIATIC,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúglistening soft cream.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, pink-tinged beige with metallic shimmer. It had semi-opaque color coverage, but this one didn‚Äôt apply as evenly as the other two. It didn‚Äôt seem to have more slip, but it sure looked as if it did. The color pulls into lip lines over time, so it is a very high maintenance color to wear. It lasted for three and a half hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",C-
GUERLAIN,ROUGE PARADE (920),Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúdeep black cherry.‚Äù It‚Äôs a deepened red with cool undertones and a creamy, lightly shiny, finish. It makes me think of ‚Äúblood red‚Äù more than ‚Äúblack cherry,‚Äù though. It was mostly opaque, applied evenly, and didn‚Äôt settle into lip lines. It wore well for four and a half hours. The consistency is lightweight, gel-like, lightly hydrating, and non-sticky.",A
GUERLAIN,L'OISEAU DE FEU (901),Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúsheer top coat with golden pearl.‚Äù It‚Äôs gold shimmer suspended in clear gloss. It‚Äôs nice to see that it is really being billed as a top coat (even the box distinguishes it from the rest of the range), and in the tube, it looks as described. That being said, it also looks a lot more shimmery in the tube than applied‚Äìthe shimmer is fine but sparse. As a top coat, it only adds shine, but the thinner consistency doesn‚Äôt give it a really plump, juicy, glossy finish. I wish there was more visible shimmer when applied, because though it‚Äôs supposed to be sheer‚Ä¶ it is also supposed to have gold pearl. It‚Äôs like a clear polish with large gold flecks that you feel like you have to fish out. Products like these are always so tricky to review (trying to consider a spectrum of clear to sheer is interesting). The shine on this only seemed to last about two hours on me, but it was comfortable to wear, non-sticky, and hydrating.",C
MAC,CEREMONIAL,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúhot pink with sparkles.‚Äù It‚Äôs a fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and very fine violet shimmer. It had semi-sheer coverage applied, and it did settle slightly into lip lines. It wore well for two and a half hours and was lightly hydrating while worn.",B
MAC,COURTING CHIC,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúdeep berry red with gold sparkles.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, cool-toned red with gold sparkle. It had semi-opaque color coverage, which applied fairly evenly, though some color settled into lip lines. It lasted for three hours on me and was hydrating while worn.",B+
MAC,ROMANTIC OVERTURE,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúclear base with sparkles.‚Äù It‚Äôs not quite clear‚Äìit‚Äôs more like a peach-tinted base with a smattering of champagne sparkle. It definitely adds warmth to the lips, but it doesn‚Äôt add much color. It lasts an hour and a half on me, unfortunately, though it is comfortable to wear. There‚Äôs not much to it, so there are several similar shades that tend to look the same applied.",B-
MAC,SEEKING ADORATION,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúplummy pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a cool-toned, medium-dark pink with subtle gold pearl. It had semi-sheer color payoff and applied evenly for the most part. The consistency was comfortable to wear, hydrating, and lasted for two hours.",B-
MAC,SOCIAL SEASON,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúviolet with blue sparkles.‚Äù It‚Äôs a semi-sheer, muted fuchsia pink with silver and violet sparkle. It applies fairly evenly and feels comfortable to wear as it has a very creamy consistency. The color only lasts for two hours, though.",B
GUCCI,FUM√©,Palette,"a nice pairing of colors, though it‚Äôs not knock-your-socks-off quality, and at this price point, you should love what you‚Äôre buying. The formula is described as ‚Äúsaturated with pigment,‚Äù but then, they later say ‚Äúbuildable color‚Äù yet it is ‚Äúpretreated and primed for high-color impact.‚Äù (Under the monos, they only say ‚Äúintensely pigmented,‚Äù while the quads say ‚Äúsaturated with color for a high-impact, buildable finish.‚Äù) Neither shade was perfect, and the right shade had a drier consistency that made it less blendable. I wish Gucci gave more product per pan or knocked down the price, because it seems overpriced relative to the other products in Gucci‚Äôs range (which are more comparable to Chanel and Dior pricing)‚Äìit would still be a luxury item either way, though, to be sure.",B
MAC,DAMN GLAMOROUS,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright pink red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium-dark red with pink undertones and a matte finish. It is lightly cool-toned but may look more obviously cool-toned if you have cool, pink undertones. It had fully opaque pigmentation, and the color went on evenly and smoothly. This shade was not quite as creamy as others in the launch, but it didn‚Äôt drag during application. It lasted for almost eight hours and left behind a stain, and it was a little drying for the last two or three hours.",A
MAC,FASHION REVIVAL,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep raspberry.‚Äù It‚Äôs a dark, muted raspberry with a semi-matte finish. The color coverage was very nearly opaque (hint of my lip freckle coming through) with even color application. The consistency was lightly creamy, easy to apply, and lasted for almost seven hours. It was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
MAC,LA VIE EN ROUGE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright orange coral.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium-dark coral-red with warm undertones and a matte finish. It‚Äôs the kind of shade that‚Äôs so bright that it plays tricks on your eyes (stare at this for awhile, then stare at something neutral!). It had a lightly creamy consistency that wasn‚Äôt heavy, slightly clingy (but not in an uncomfortable way), and lasted for six and a half hours (probably wearable until about eight before you really needed to reapply). It was a little drying towards the end.",A
MAC,FRANK-N-FURTER,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep raspberry wine [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a deepened red with subtle, cool undertones with a matte finish. I don‚Äôt get raspberry/wine vibes from it (not even in the tube). It had mostly opaque color coverage with a lightly creamy consistency that allowed the color to go on evenly and smoothly. This color wore well for six and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating. I didn‚Äôt have any feathering/bleeding with this shade, but I‚Äôm not prone to either.",A-
MAC,OBLIVION,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúvivid bluish-red [with an Amplified finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, brightened red with a luminous sheen and neutral-to-cool undertones. I can barely detect the blue undertones, as it just looks warm-toned against my complexion. It‚Äôs only when I swatched it against more strongly blue- and orange-toned lipsticks that it seemed to look cooler. It was creamy, easy to apply, and lasted for six and a half hours on me. It was lightly hydrating and didn‚Äôt feather or bleed outside the edges of my lip line.",A
MAC,SIN,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep dark blue red [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a dark, burgundy-red with subtle cool, fuchsia-ish undertones with a matte finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff, though it is buildable to fully opaque color. I think it is only when you try one of MAC‚Äôs original Matte formulas and then immediately try one of their newer shades that you can appreciate the improvements they‚Äôve made. The texture of this is much drier, so it does drag and tug on the lips somewhat. It was a bit drying over time, though the color lasted for over seven hours.",B
MAC,STRANGE JOURNEY,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúyellowish brick red [with a Matte finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, orange-red with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had really good color payoff, and the texture was creamy and glided on beautifully (creamiest of the four). The color stayed on well for six hours and left a stain behind. It was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
URBAN DECAY,FULL FRONTAL,Palette,"six, miniature-sized Revolution lipsticks with three new, limited edition, exclusive shades to the set paired with three previously released shades (Gash, which was limited edition when it released, and Liar and F-Bomb, both of which are part of the permanent range). I think the set is a great idea, as you can try multiple shades without spending the full-priced equivalent to do so. The only downside is that mini lipsticks can be frustrating to use, because they‚Äôre less comfortable to hold (so much smaller!) and are more fragile (two of the six broke at the base while applying). The lipsticks themselves are consistent with the Revolution formula, which is one of my favorites, and I really hope these new shades get added to the permanent range.",A
TOO FACED,UNDER THE MISTLETOE,Palette,"three shimmery takes on three of the brand‚Äôs La Creme Lip Creams. Each is full-sized, so the set contains $66 worth of lipstick. The glittering pink mini bag it comes doesn‚Äôt feel particularly well made, and it flakes glitter everywhere. The formula is supposed to be like their La Creme (highly pigmented, hydrating, smooth), just with shimmer. They‚Äôre not as thick or as creamy, and with two shades, you can feel some of the shimmer‚Äìnot gritty or really rough, but you can feel it when applying. They have more of a semi-matte finish from a normal viewing distance, despite the shimmer.",C+
CLE DE PEAU,COSMIC AURA (308),Palette,"a set of four shades that run cooler-toned with a purple bent. I knew I had to see just how well (or poorly) the brand could do purples, as this is a color range that many brands under-deliver on. Unfortunately, this quad did fall short: two of the purple-hued shades were slightly powdery in texture as well as weaker in pigment. This is a more unique set of shades, relative to Stellar Gaze (307) that I reviewed earlier, though the second shade is one that a few brands do.",B+
BOBBI BROWN,HOT BERRY,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright, pink berry.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and violet iridiescent shimmer. It had mostly opaque color coverage with a smidgen of translucency that enabled the natural lip color to come through (this may turn red on those with more natural red pigment in their lip color). The consistency was lightweight, creamy, and easy to apply and didn‚Äôt have any issues on or when I pressed my lips together (a problem with some of the other shades in the range). It wore well for five and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
BOBBI BROWN,LADY RUBA,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright, reddish coral.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, orange-red with warm undertones and a satin finish. It was incredibly pigmented and yielded full color coverage in a single stroke. The consistency was light-to-medium in weight but applied smoothly and stayed even throughout the wear. It lasted for six hours on me, though it was neither hydrating nor drying. This is a very common color‚Äìthere are a lot of extremely similar shades to it.",A
BOBBI BROWN,WATERMELON,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright orange, pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, pink-coral with subtle warm undertones and a satin finish. On me, it almost looks cool-toned, but it is a warmer pink. It had rich, opaque color payoff, and the formula felt comfortable to wear, creamy, while it applied smoothly and evenly. This shade wore well for five and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
CLE DE PEAU,STELLAR GAZE #1,Palette,"a set of four, warm-toned autumnal shades that range from gold to plum. The texture of the eyeshadows is soft, velvety, lightly creamy and silky, while being incredibly blendable. They feel smooth to the touch, and the finishes are particularly flattering on the eyelid‚Äìthink a luminous, glowy highlighter that adds life but doesn‚Äôt accentuate pores‚Äìthis is in the same vein, just for the eyes. All four shades lasted for eight and a half hours, and the first three shades had really nice color payoff, but the last‚Äìthe plum‚Äìshade was a little less pigmented. Overall, it‚Äôs a nice quad, though the shades are more dupable than not, so it may not be particularly interesting to some unless it‚Äôs a go-to combination.",A
FYRINNAE,SEXY NERD,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright magenta with gold shimmer and highlight.‚Äù It‚Äôs a vibrant, medium-dark fuchsia pink with gold shimmer. The layer of gold shimmer seems to be a more defining characteristic of this shade, as it made it harder to dupe.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,I746 WATERMELON,Blush,"a brightened, coral-orange with warm undertones and a soft, golden shimmer-sheen finish.",A
GIORGIO ARMANI,QUARZO (2),Eyeliner,"a metallic, mauve-taupe that sometimes is so reflective that it looks like a warm bronze and other times like a mushroom-y gray. It was a total pain-in-the-behind to photograph due to its seriously reflective finish.",B
GIORGIO ARMANI,AMETISTA (3),Eyeliner,"a muted, bluish-purple wit gray and multi-colored shimmer (primarily teal). It also has a more metallic sheen that reflects a good bit of light back, which gives it a lighter appearance applied. I looked, but nothing that I‚Äôve reviewed before seems to come close to the color of this eyeliner.",B
GIORGIO ARMANI,ORO OSCURO (6),Eyeliner,"a brightened, olive green with warm, golden undertones and a metallic sheen.",B
BURBERRY,GRAPHITE (NO. 28),Eyeliner,"a dark, smoky brown with cool, gray undertones and a satin finish. It had good color payoff with a soft, silky texture that just a smidgen on the powdery side but remained blendable and easy to use on the lid. The color lasted for nine hours before fading.",A-
BURBERRY,STORM GREY (NO. 27),Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, cool-toned taupe with a soft, plummy-mauve influence and a satin finish. it had good pigmentation that went on evenly and smoothly. The texture had a soft, finely-milled, velvety feel to it that wasn‚Äôt powdery. This shade wore well for nine hours before showing signs of wear.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,I922 ELECTRIC PURPLE,Blush,"a vibrant, violet purple with cool, pink undertones and a satiny sheen.",A-
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,THE REBEL,Palette,"four shades that revolve around a green-hued theme. The quality was consistently high across the four shades with the more glittery shade having some fall out, but the pigmentation, texture, and application of the four were nice. This brand has been available (along with this particular quad) for awhile in the UK, and I bought this from Selfridges, but it will be available stateside at Bergdorf Goodman, Nordstrom, Beautylish, NET-A-PORTER tomorrow, September 2nd. Of the products I‚Äôve tried from the brand, I think her eyeshadows are not just good quality but more unique. (In general, the line is high quality, but the shades are often more dupable than not.) Most of the pricing is in line with other designer brands like Chanel and Dior, but the quad pricing is noticeably lower ($52 vs. ~$60 of Chanel, Dior, etc.). It contains about the same to a little less in terms of product weight/quantity to other comparable brands.",A
CLE DE PEAU,SAND BEIGE (13),Highlighter,"light-medium, gold-shimmered peachy-beige with warm undertones and a luminous finish.",A
ARDENCY INN,TANGERINE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúmatte yellow orange with a neon kick.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, yellowed orange with a mostly matte finish. It had good pigmentation, and the texture was soft, finely-milled, and velvety, though a smidgen powdery. It lasted for ten hours before fading.",A
ARDENCY INN,ORCHID,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúbright fuchsia with extreme blue reflects.‚Äù It‚Äôs a vibrant, fuchsia-purple with cool, blue undertones and a bluish-violet shimmer-sheen. It had incredibly rich color payoff that went on smoothly and evenly, lasted for ten hours, and was a dream to apply.",A+
ARDENCY INN,PUNCH,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúmatte bright coral with neon pink and yellow undertones.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, coral-red with a matte finish and warm undertones. It had fairly good color payoff, while the texture was a little powdery, it was soft, finely-milled, and easy to blend. It lasted for ten hours before fading.",A-
ARDENCY INN,ROYAL,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúroyal purple with red undertones and slight blue reflects.‚Äù It‚Äôs an insanely intense, vibrant violet purple with cool, blue undertones and a soft, frosted finish. A little goes a very long way with this shade! The texture was soft, buttery, and smooth, while it was easy to blend on the skin. It wore well for ten hours and still hadn‚Äôt faded/creased.",A+
MAC,ARTIFICIAL EARTH,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúsoft mauve nude [with a Satin finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, neutral pink with a soft, frosted finish. It had good color payoff, while the texture was soft, velvety, and blendable. The color wore well for eight hours before fading slightly.",A
MAC,MARSH,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúsoft dirty olive green [with a Satin finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a softened, medium-dark olive green with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had nice pigmentation that went on easily and wore well for eight hours.",A-
MAC,NATURAL WILDERNESS,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúdirty mustard golden nude [with a Satin finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, ochre brown with warm, yellow undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had excellent color payoff with a soft, velvety texture that was very blendable on the lid. This shade lasted for eight and a half hours on me.",A
MAC,STONY,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúsoft grey concrete [with a Satin finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, neutral-to-warm-toned pewter with a satin sheen. It‚Äôs a mix of brown, green, and silver/gray. It had mostly opaque color payoff, and the texture was soft and smooth like the other shades. It lasted for eight hours on me before fading.",B+
NARS,ANITA,Lipstick,"an ‚Äúantique rose.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark pink with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had fully opaque color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly, while the color lasted for four and a half hours and was neither hydrating nor drying.",A
NARS,JANE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúterracotta rose.‚Äù It‚Äôs a slightly muted, medium-dark orange with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had rich, opaque color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly. This shade wore well for five hours on me. It was neither drying nor hydrating over time.",A
NARS,BRIGITTE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúnude rose.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, light-medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had full color coverage in one pass, and the color glided on easily and evenly. On me, the color lasted for four and a half hours, and it was lightly hydrating.",A
NARS,BARBARA,Lipstick,"a ‚Äútan rose.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, peachy-beige with a hint of pink. It had rich pigmentation that covered the lips entirely, and it was smooth and even when it applied. The color wore well for four and a half hours on me and was neither hydrating nor drying.",A
NARS,RAQUEL,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúpink beige.‚Äù It‚Äôs a lightly pink-tinted, light-medium peach with a glossy finish. It had opaque color payoff, but the consistency had more slip compared to other shades in the range, so it didn‚Äôt apply as evenly. It also will show ‚Äúlines‚Äù if you press your lips together. On me, this one lasted for three and a half hours (I believe the shortest of all the shades I‚Äôve tested so far) and was lightly hydrating.",B
STILA,SOUL,Palette,"twelve eyeshadows in an assortment of a slightly earthy set of more neutral shades. The eyeshadow formula is described as ‚Äúluxe,‚Äù ‚Äúlong-lasting,‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh-intensity‚Äù that ‚Äúdeliver rich color with a luxurious satin finish.‚Äù They can be used wet or dry, but I wouldn‚Äôt use the majority with a damp brush, because it creates a stiffer, hardened surface on the top that you‚Äôll have to remove if you want to use the eyeshadow again. I was able to use the more frosted shades with a damp brush without issues later on. The frosts, in general, perform better than the other shades, as they have a denser texture, but they still tend to be powdery. The mattes have a thinner, drier consistency that feels soft in the pan but just doesn‚Äôt translate as intensely on the skin. It is a huge improvement from Body, but there‚Äôs still a lot of powdery shades with hit or miss pigmentation. I feel like it‚Äôs a palette that absolutely requires a primer to do the heavy-lifting and/or a damp application (in the case of the frosts) to be workable. At this price point, though, there are too many misses.",C+
BARE ESCENTUALS,THE HOLLYWOOD ENDING,Palette,"disappointing as a duo. I don‚Äôt think that they work that well together, because the drier consistency of more frosted Dazzle doesn‚Äôt play so well with the more matte finish of Promise. It‚Äôs an unusual pair of colors, but this one didn‚Äôt knock it out of the park‚Äìand I‚Äôm so accustomed to bareMinerals doing so with the Ready range!",B+
STILA,BODY,Palette,"twelve eyeshadows in an assortment of jewel-tones. The eyeshadow formula is described as ‚Äúluxe,‚Äù ‚Äúlong-lasting,‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh-intensity‚Äù that ‚Äúdeliver rich color with a luxurious satin finish.‚Äù They can be used wet or dry, but I wouldn‚Äôt use the majority with a damp brush, because it creates a stiffer, hardened surface on the top that you‚Äôll have to scrape or rub away (paper towel works well) on the satin/matte finishes. I found this palette to be incredibly powdery, poorly pigmented, prone to fading, and a generally frustrating experience. I wouldn‚Äôt have paid $10 for this, let alone the $49 I actually paid for it. I bought all four (like a complete and utter fool), but I‚Äôve only tested two for wear so far, and I think this one is the worst, but tentatively speaking, I don‚Äôt have high hopes for the others.",F
MAKEUP GEEK,JACKPOT,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúpale shimmery yellow with just a hint of glitter.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, yellow gold with a frosted, metallic finish and chunky sparkle. It had fairly good color payoff, but the texture is rather chunky, which made it difficult to apply. Applied dry, it didn‚Äôt bind well or go on smoothly over the skin, and applied damp, it tended to chunk and thicken in places so it was uneven. The color wore well for nine hours, but I had noticeable fall out throughout the day.",C
MAKEUP GEEK,POKER FACE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúmedium golden bronze.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark bronze brown with warm, coppery-gold shimmer and a metallic sheen. Applied dry, it was a little less copper-toned but still had good color payoff, and it had a very finely-milled texture. Applied damp, it was smoother, richer, and more molten-looking. When I tested it, the color lasted for ten hours.",A
MAKEUP GEEK,NIGHT LIFE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúlight shimmery rose brown taupe.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark brown with warm undertones and a taupe-hued, metallic sheen. Applied dry, it was a little dusty but very finely milled, and applied damp, it was more metallic but easier to work with and smoother against the skin. It wore well for nine and a half hours without fading.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,NEGLIGEE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark plum with warm undertones and a soft shine. It had rich, opaque color coverage that glided on evenly and smoothly without tugging on the lips. The color lasted for five hours and was nicely hydrating while worn.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,TWIST OF FATE,Lipstick,"a brightened, medium orange-coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had fully opaque color coverage, and the consistency was lightly creamy to easily apply without dragging but still felt lightweight, comfortable, and smoothed lips. This shade lasted for five and a half hours on me and was hydrating while worn.",A
URBAN DECAY,NAKED2 BASICS,Palette,"six eyeshadows; five have matte finishes, one has a more satiny finish. The palette leans cool-toned, but I didn‚Äôt find it to be strongly cool-toned across the board. The palette is the same size as the previous Naked Basics palette, though this one has a slightly different color and has lighter lettering. The quality is good overall, but the darkest shade is under-pigmented and a little harder to blend, and most of the matte shades were a little powdery, though they‚Äôre soft and didn‚Äôt look dry or powdery on the lid.",B+
OCC,LAMENT,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúneutral rose beige.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, muted orange‚Äìnot quite peach, not quite true orange, and it‚Äôs not as bright as you might expected.",A
GUERLAIN,FOREVER BROWN (305),Lipstick,"a medium-dark, plummy-brown with warm, red undertones and a very subtle, gold micro-shimmer (it looks glossy but not really shimmery). It had mostly opaque color coverage‚Äìthere‚Äôs a very light translucency that gives the formula a lighter look on. The color wears four and a half hours, and it was lightly hydrating on me.",A
GUERLAIN,ROUGE KISS (325),Lipstick,"a brightened, coral-red with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. This shade didn‚Äôt appear to have any shimmer, for those who prefer their lipsticks to be shimmer-free. It had mostly opaque color coverage that looked and felt lightweight and comfortable. It lasted for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",A
OCC,MANHUNTER,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúred-orange with golden shimmer.‚Äù It‚Äôs a vibrant, orange-red with warm undertones and a very fine, coppery-gold metallic shimmer.",A
BARE ESCENTUALS,THE BIG DEBUT,Palette,"one of six new additions to the brand‚Äôs duo range. Long-time readers might remember that I‚Äôm a huge fan of the Ready formula, so I always yearn for even more shades. The Big Debut works well for a two-shade look, as one is more shimmery than the other, and there is nice contrast, yet the two easily blend together. It was a good duo overall, though the shades weren‚Äôt perfect (and this formula can get to perfect).",A-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,HEADLINER (608),Lipstick,"a ‚Äúberry sangria.‚Äù It‚Äôs a cool-toned, medium-dark raspberry pink with a satin-matte finish. There‚Äôs a slight shine to the finish, but it is fairly matte. It had full color coverage, and it applied smoothly and evenly. This was actually the best-performing shade of the four I bought. It was lightly creamy and didn‚Äôt tug or pull at the lips, and it was more comfortable to wear. It didn‚Äôt feel as thick, and it didn‚Äôt feel chalky at all. On me, it wore well for six and a half hours and was lightly drying‚Äìand it didn‚Äôt ‚Äúcrack‚Äù like the other shades I tried.",A-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,POW (600),Lipstick,"a ‚Äúpeony pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, light-medium pink with subtle warm undertones and a matte finish. It had fairly opaque color coverage, but the consistency had a thicker, chalkier feel going on, so it did drag here and there. I was able to get mostly even color, but after two and a half hours of wear, the color started to pull into lip lines and ‚Äúcrack.‚Äù The color wore for about five hours. It was lightly drying while worn.",C
GIVENCHY,OR INSOLITE (12),Eyeshadow,"Äúgold.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium gold with subtle yellow undertones‚Äìit‚Äôs almost a ‚Äúcool‚Äù gold because it lacks really strong, yellow/orange warmth with lighter gold shimmer and sparkle.",D+
GUERLAIN,AIR KISS (304),Lipstick,"a softened, medium-dark plum with subtle warm undertones and pink and gold shimmer. It had mostly opaque color coverage that felt and looked lightweight and had a glossy shine. I can feel the shimmer slightly when I apply the lipstick, but the color goes on evenly and smoothly. I don‚Äôt notice the shimmer in it once on until after three hours of wear. It lasts for four hours on me when I tested it.",A-
MAC,PURE FLASH,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúpale champagne.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, peachy-beige with warm undertones and a frosted finish. It had mostly opaque color in one layer, and it applied evenly for the most part on the lid. It doesn‚Äôt crease, and I only noticed slight fading after nine hours of wear.",A
MAC,SUPERWATT,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúlight shimmering taupe.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, warm-taoned taupe brown with a hint of gray and frosted, metallic finish. It was mostly opaque with one layer of product, which could be sheered out for more of a wash if desired. The color wore well for eight and a half hours before starting to fade.",A-
MAC,BLACKLIT,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúblack with multidimensional pearl.‚Äù It‚Äôs a soft, medium black with multi-colored sparkle‚Äìthe teal sparkle seems to dominate. It had semi-opaque color coverage that applied evenly for the most part. It was buildable with two to three layers. The color lasted for eight hours with minor fall out.",B-
MAC,SWITCH TO BLUE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúrich cobalt.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark blue with a pearly sheen. It seemed to have good color payoff, but it had a tendency to sheer out and apply unevenly on the lid. The color wore well for eight hours before starting to fade slightly.",C+
MAC,A NOVEL ROMANCE,Palette,"a mix of cool neutrals ranging from a green-gold to a dark brown. This quad was more consistent in quality across the board with most shades being decent to good. For those who often find warmer-toned neutrals to be difficult to work with, you may enjoy these murkier, more subdued ones. It will launch with the rest of the collection on August 14th online, August 21st in-stores.",B+
MAC,A PASSIONATE QUEST,Palette,"a mix of cool pink and purple. Three of the four shades were quite good, with the very last shade being somewhat of a miss (not a total miss, but it could be better). They work well together, and there is a good mix of finishes and contrast in the palette so there are several looks that could be created from it. It will launch with the rest of the collection on August 14th online, August 21st in-stores.",A-
MAC,AN AMOROUS ADVENTURE,Palette,"a mix of smoky shades from teal to brown to black. Two of the four shades are part of the permanent range, and one is a repromote (so check your stash if you‚Äôre a long-time collector!). I was pleased to find that the quality was fairly good overall. It also reminded me a bit of the color combination from YSL‚Äôs Fetiche palette, though they aren‚Äôt dupes (just similar ‚Äúat a glance‚Äù)",B+
MAC,ANIMAL INSTINCTS,Palette,"a ‚Äúshimmering plum [with a Frost finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark warm plum with a soft sheen. It had fairly good color payoff, and the texture was soft, thin but not powdery, and blendable. On me, the color wore well for eight hours before starting to fade.",B+
MAC,FUN ENDING,Blush,"a ‚Äúsoft neutral peach [with a Satin finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a pink-peach with warm undertones and a satin-matte finish. I noticed that this blush had a tendency to darken on the skin if there was any natural oils on it, which made it look very similar to Animal Instincts applied lightly! The texture was soft, blendable, and smooth, while it had good pigmentation. It lasted for almost eight hours on me before fading.",A-
OCC,PAGAN,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúblackened purple.‚Äù It‚Äôs a deep, dark purple with cool undertones and a lightly shiny finish. This color also was prone to staining anything and everything it came into contact with nearly instantly, so be careful when applying!",C+
SLEEK,ARABIAN NIGHTS,Palette,"a limited edition set of twelve eyeshadows in shades of ‚Äúdeep tones of green, blue and gold.‚Äù The i-Divine Eyeshadow formula is supposed to be ‚Äúsuper-pigmented [and] long-lasting.‚Äù I think this is a worthwhile palette at this price point; there are a few misses, but there are enough hits to make it compelling. If you typically use primer, I think some of the misses will be more manageable. When Sleek nails it, they REALLY nail it, but when they miss, it‚Äôs usually by a fair amount, and I usually find their satin/matte shades to be a bit drier, which results in sheerer color payoff compared to their more shimmery shades that are usually amazing.",B+
MAC,STYLE APPROVED,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright orange coral.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium orange with a very, very slight coral tinge and a soft shine and subtle gold shimmer. It had mostly opaque color coverage that was buildable from semi-sheer and applied fairly evenly. It wore well for three and a half hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",A-
MAC,TROPICAL BUZZ,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdirty muted orange.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, pumpkin orange with warm, yellow undertones and a glossy shine. It had buildable, mostly opaque color coverage, but the texture was slightly thicker and more emollient, so it didn‚Äôt apply evenly. This shade wore for three hours on me and was somewhat hydrating.",B-
MAC,WEAR WITH FLARE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúmidtone neutral.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, rosy beige with warm undertones and a soft shine. It had buildable, mostly opaque color coverage, but it didn‚Äôt apply totally even as it tended to streak and bunch up due to the more slippery consistency. This shade lasted two and a half hours on me, which is on the short side for me, but it was lightly hydrating.",C+
OCC,COVET,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúgolden buff neutral.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, muted peachy-beige with a cream finish. It was opaque after two coats and applied well without streaking or bubbling. It dried down to a high gloss finish. The consistency was slightly thick but not difficult to use. I typically get a week of wear with minor tip wear but no chipping with the brand‚Äôs formula. I don‚Äôt have anything that has as much brown in it that‚Äôs not actually brown, but these were the closest I could think of",A
OCC,DANGEROUS,NailPolish,"an ‚Äúopaque, true grey.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, neutral-to-cool-toned gray with a cream finish. This shade was very pigmented and was almost opaque in one coat, though I used two coats just to be sure. It had a slightly thick consistency, but it was easy to work with and didn‚Äôt streak or pool along the edges.",A
OCC,PAGAN,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúblackened purple.‚Äù It‚Äôs a deep, dark‚Äìbut still rich, slightly brightened‚Äìpurple with cool undertones and a jelly-cream finish. It was mostly opaque after two coats, but there was a very slight translucency to it (which is what made it look like a jelly-cream hybrid).",B+
SURRATT BEAUTY,PARFAIT,Blush,"a ‚Äúcoral.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, coral-orange with warm undertones and a soft, satin finish.",A
OCC,VAIN,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep, dark indigo.‚Äù It‚Äôs a rich, medium-dark blue with a soft shine. It‚Äôs cool-toned, but it seems to be a subtle, cool undertone. The color will stain the lips for a good while, just as a heads up. I couldn‚Äôt think of any dupes of this shade from the blue lipsticks I‚Äôve reviewed in the past.",B
YVES SAINT LAURENT,FETICHE,Palette,"a new, limited edition eyeshadow palette with five shades for fall. The palette has a leather panel on the front. I bought mine from Nordstrom, but it‚Äôs also available on YSL. I can appreciate the interesting combination of colors, and the finishes are more complex in person than they appear in photos. YSL claims 12-hour crease-resistant wear, but there‚Äôs usually noticeable fading after eight to nine hours and creasing by ten hours. I wish the wear-time claim wasn‚Äôt quite so extreme, because it does wear well relative to the average powder eyeshadow. I would also have liked to have seen the teal shade with a lot more pigment behind it.",B-
DIOR,TROMPE L'OEIL (011),Eyeshadow,"a brightened, sparkling silver with a very fine shimmer and sparkle. It had semi-opaque color payoff but is prone to sheering ouot, so it seems to apply mostly as a wash. To build it up, you really have to wait between layers. It takes about thirty seconds or so to set‚Äìplenty of time to blend and work with it‚Äìand wears for nine and a half hours on me. I didn‚Äôt have any issues with fall out.",C
DIOR,REVEUSE (271),Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, navy blue with a sparkly, frosted finish. It seemed pigmented, but it had a rather chunky/gritty texture that made the color/sparkle flake away. As it dried down, flakes of blue came off the lid and landed underneath my eye (this was in the first five minutes or less). It continued throughout the nine hours I wore it, and though it didn‚Äôt crease, it progressively faded as the color flaked away. It was a very odd experience, as I can‚Äôt remember many eyeshadows flaking away.",F
BITE BEAUTY,CHAMPAGNE,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúrose gold pearl.‚Äù It‚Äôs a sheer, gold-shimmered pink. It seems to darken and even out my natural lip color slightly while adding a touch of shine. I don‚Äôt know of a really worthwhile dupe (something that is more in the ‚Äútinted lip balm‚Äù family), given that this is an ultra-hydrating formula with such subtle color. If you like the idea of the color but want a true gloss",A
KAT VON D,COVEN,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúmatte lavender.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, cool-toned lavender purple with a matte finish.",F
CHANEL,TISSE GABRIELLE (208),Palette,"a cooler-toned mix of darker neutrals with one warmer shade in the form of a white gold, otherwise the quad is variations on taupe. Overall, the eyeshadows wore well and lasted over eight hours (or longer, noted below), had decent to great pigmentation, and were easy to apply.",A
CHANEL,TISSE VENITIEN (232),Palette,"a cooler-toned set of shades where pewter and green dominate. I‚Äôm not sold on the inclusion of the peach shade in this quad; I longed for something cooler-toned‚Äìmore beige or almost like a gray-ish beige. I also found that against my skin tone, the natural warmth seemed to overwhelm both greens and made them run together with the pewter shade. Overall, the colors had good color payoff, were easy to apply and blend, and wore well without primer.",A
TOO FACED,MELTED CANDY,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbright fuchsia pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium fuchsia pink with very subtle blue undertones. On me, this type of color almost looks warm-toned.",A+
CHANEL,TISSE MADEMOISELLE (214),Palette,"a mix of beige and brown that runs warm-toned. The colors work well together, though I felt like this palette was less versatile compared to others as it seemed to offer less contrast when used as the medium brown and peach were very similar applied. They work, but the look ends up being subtle gradient of light peach to brown, which may or may not be what you‚Äôre looking for. The entire quad, though visually they don‚Äôt seem particularly small. Baked formulations often weigh less than more traditional powder formulas do, but it‚Äôs hard to say if it contains as many uses as the regular quads.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,SATISFACTION (214),Lipgloss,a ‚Äúpinkish mauve with copper sheen.‚Äù It‚Äôs a rosy brown with golden copper shimmer.,A
CHANEL,TISSE CAMELIA (202),Palette,"a soft, pink and purple selection of shades. Overall, the quad had good color payoff, soft, smooth textures that were easy to apply to bare skin as well as blended well. All four shades wore well for over nine hours on me, with the darkest shade wearing slightly longer. To reiterate, these are significantly lighter (smaller) at 0.07 oz. for the entire quad, though visually they don‚Äôt seem particularly small. Baked formulations often weigh less than more traditional powder formulas do, but it‚Äôs hard to say if it contains as many uses as the regular quads.",A
KAT VON D,POE,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúshimmery navy.‚Äù It‚Äôs a deep, dark navy blue with a slight purple tint and fine, violet and midnight blue shimmer. It‚Äôs more like a mix of Illamasqua Kontrol (P, $24.00) and Illamasqua Disciple (P, $24.00) mixed together, as the latter is lighter and bluer.",A-
CHANEL,TISSE RIVOLI (226),Palette,"a set of warm-toned neutrals. It is very reminiscent of Chanel Raffinement, though they‚Äôre not exactly the same, they are certainly similar. All four shades wore well for just over nine hours and after, there was very, very slight creasing (no primer). The texture is soft, smooth, and they eyeshadows are incredibly blendable. The only downside is that the baked formula is a very lightweight one, so the quad only contains 0.07 oz., when many single powder eyeshadows are 0.05 oz. on average. Visually, they don‚Äôt seem particularly small, and it is often the case with baked products that they weigh less than traditional powders, but it‚Äôs hard to say if it contains as many uses as the regular quads.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,WHAM (604),Lipstick,"a ‚Äúcoral rose.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, coral-red with warm undertones and a satin matte finish. It had rich, opaque color coverage that lasted for six hours on me but didn‚Äôt fade as evenly as I would have liked to see, as it settled into lip lines after four hours.",B-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,POP-ARAZZI (606),Lipstick,"an ‚Äúelectric rose.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, cool-toned, medium pink with blue undertones. It had full color coverage, and the color stayed on for five hours and started to ‚Äúcrack‚Äù and settle after three and a half hours of wear. Melt Cosmetics Stupid Love (P, $19.00) is brighter, bluer-based. This was the least chalky-feeling shade of the ones I tried.",B
NARS,TORRE DEL ORO,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúcherry red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bright, medium-dark, blue-based red with a cream finish. It was very nearly opaque after two coats of the polish. The consistency was slightly thin but not watery or difficult to work with. It dried down to a glossy finish. This type of red is always beautiful, but it is also quite common",A-
NARS,SHAMELESS RED,NailPolish,"q ‚Äúpink flamingo.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, pink-coral with subtle, warm undertones and a glossy, creamy finish. It was fully opaque after two coats of polish, and it applied evenly, smoothly, and without streaking.",A
NARS,BLOW-UP,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúmandarin orange.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium-dark orange with warm, reddish undertones and a cream finish. It was richly pigmented and had opaque coverage in two coats. It dried down to a high-gloss finish without the need of a top coat. The consistency wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin, so it applied easily.",A
URBAN DECAY,GUNMETAL,Eyeliner,a ‚Äúblack with black and silver sparkle.‚Äù It‚Äôs a mix of black and silver glitter suspended on a clear base.,B
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,SHOOTING STARS (316),Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúberry mauve with shimmer.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium-dark brick red-plum with pink shimmer and subtle sparkle. It had warm undertones. I actually found this type of color hard to dupe in gloss-form, particularly because of the coverage of this one. Maybelline Almond Aura (130) (LE) is lighter, less red/plum. Bobbi Brown Uber Suede (P, $24.00) is browner.",A
NARS,PASTORALE,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúrose gold.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, pinky-copper‚Äìit really is rose gold‚Äìwith a metallic, foil-like finish. There were almost no visible brush strokes, as nearly all of them disappeared once the polish dried. The color was opaque after two coats of polish, and it dried quickly. This shade lasted for seven days with minor tip wear on me.",A
NARS,MILOS,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúrich gold.‚Äù It‚Äôs a shimmery, buttery yellow gold with a frosted finish. It was mostly opaque after two coats, and there were very subtle brush strokes‚ÄìI really only noticed them at angles. The consistency was on the thicker side, and the drying time was longer than any of the other shades I tried, and it was unforgiving if you applied a second coat too quickly.",B
NARS,AMARAPURA,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúsilver chrome.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium silver foil with a metallic, foil-like finish. It really looks a lot like tinfoil on the nails! It was fully opaque after two coats, though it was almost opaque after a single coat. The consistency is slightly thin but not problematic, and there are very slight visible brush strokes but most of them disappeared after the polish dried down.",A-
MILANI,BELLA PINK (13),Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúshimmering pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, icy pink with cool undertones and a frosted, metallic finish. Applied dry, it was semi-opaque, and applied with a dampened brush, it was richly pigmented. The texture was soft, just a smidgen powdery, but almost buttery and dense. It wore well for eight hours before fading.",B+
MILANI,BELLA VIOLET (14),Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúshimmering violet purple.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medim purple with subtle, cool undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-sheer pigmentation when applied dry, and then it intensified to semi-opaque coverage when applied with a dampened brush. The texture was drier, a little more powdery and prone to disappearing‚Äìit did not adhere well to the skin. I tried applying it with a dampened brush on the lid, and it still just didn‚Äôt seem to layer or build well. What color managed to stick to the skin stayed on for seven hours.",D
MILANI,BELLA PURPLE (15),Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúrich purple satin matte.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, warm-toned purple with a pearly, metallic sheen. Applied dry, it had semi-opaque, softer color, while applied damp, it was richer, smoother, and more opaque. The consistency was soft but not powdery, and it was easy to blend on the skin.",B+
NARS,JARDIN PERDU,Palette,"a cool-toned set of shades that is new‚Äìand limited edition!‚Äìfor fall. It‚Äôs supposed to be online on July 15th on NARS, and then a full release to the usual retailers on August 1st. I think if you really loved the texture of Kauai, you‚Äôll love the texture of these shades. I will say these two felt a smidgen softer, so sometimes, it seems like more product loosens from the pan than necessary.",A-
NARS,UNLAWFUL,Blush,"an ‚Äúamber pink with silver pearls.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, rosy-brown with warm undertones and silver shimmer and slight silver sparkle. Becca Lychee/Opal (P, $27.00) is more shimmery, cream.",A-
ZOYA,ALMA,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúwarm golden peach metallic.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, tangerine orange with gold shimmer and holographic sparkle. It was semi-opaque after two coats, though Zoya describes it as ‚Äúfully opaque in 2 coats.‚Äù It applied evenly, but if you want full color coverage, I would recommend three coats.",A-
ZOYA,HARPER,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúcotton candy pink with a spun gold shimmer.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium cool-toned pink with warm, gold shimmer and holographic sparkle. It was mostly opaque after two coats, though there was some visible nail line at certain angles/lighting conditions. Zoya describes it as ‚Äúfully opaque in 2 coats,‚Äù though. This shade wore well for ten days with minor tip wear but no chipping.",A-
ZOYA,JESY,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúfiery coral orange metallic holo.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium orange-coral with warm undertones, gold shimmer, and holographic sparkle. It was semi-sheer with visible nail line, though Zoya describes these as ‚Äúfully opaque in 2 coats.‚Äù Though it wasn‚Äôt as pigmented as anticipated, it didn‚Äôt streak when applied.",B+
ZOYA,BINX,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúspicy orchid purple dappled with gold metallic and holo sparkles.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium pink with gold shimmer and holographic sparkle. It was mostly opaque after two coats, but it had a bit of translucency and visible nail line. Zoya lists the intensity as 3 (with 5 being opaque), but then the description says it has 2-coat coverage and the brand-provided swatch shows opaque color. This shade wore well for almost ten days with minor tip wear when I tested it.",A
ZOYA,STASSI,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúbrilliant citron green with a gold metallic glaze and holographic finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, yellow-toned green with gold shimmer and holographic sparkle.

ZOYA,MUSE,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúblue raspberry holographic fizz with a subtle vein of gold.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark blue with aqua green and gold shimmer and holographic micro-glitter. It was semi-opaque after two coats, but there was visible nail line. If you want more opaque color, I think you would need three coats. Zoya lists the intensity as 3 (with 5 being opaque), but then the description says it has 2-coat coverage and the brand-provided swatch shows opaque color. This shade wore well for ten days with minor tip wear but no chipping.",B-
ESSIE,CHILLS & THRILLS,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúsupercharged blue violet.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, bluish-purple with a semi-matte finish. It was mostly opaque after two coats. The formula was slightly watery, so the first coat was streaky, but the second coat covered better and hid the streakiness.",B
ESSIE,I'M ADDICTED,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúneon aquamarine blue.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, light-medium blue with a satin finish. It was semi-opaque after two coats, but it would really need a third for opaque color. The consistency was thin and watery, so the application was streaky.",C+
ESSIE,VICES VERSA,NailPolish,"a ‚Äújuicy neon lime.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, light-medium chartreuse with warm, yellow undertones and a satin finish. This one was semi-sheer after two coats, and even three coats was only semi-opaque (see my middle finger), and the application was very difficult. It was very thin and watery, and as a result, it streaked and never leveled.",D-
ILLAMASQUA,FLIRTATIOUS,Blush,"a ‚Äúsoft pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, peach-coral with warm undertones and a satin-matte finish.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,CABARET (146),Lipstick,"a slightly muted, cool-toned, medium-dark berry with a luminous sheen.",A
MAKEUP GEEK,SUMMER FLING,Blush,"a ‚Äúsoft burnt orange.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium orange with warm, red undertones and a semi-matte finish.",A
BUXOM,DOLLY,Lipstick,"a ‚Äúshimmering mauve.‚Äù It‚Äôs a rosy plum with warm undertones and a soft, pearly shimmer.",A
DOLCE AND GABBANA,FIRE (610),Lipstick,"a ‚Äúfire engine red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bold, brightened orange-red with a satin finish. The color coverage was fantastic with full, opaque color in a single pass. The consistency was creamy enough to apply the color evenly, but it didn‚Äôt slide around once on. This shade lasted for six hours on me and left a stain behind. It‚Äôs a gorgeous color, but this is one of those shades that many, many brands have done; there are a vast number of extremely similar shades",A+
DOLCE AND GABBANA,DEVIL (620),Lipstick,"an ‚Äúorange red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, warm-toned red with orange undertones and a satin finish. This shade is darker and more muted in comparison to Fire. The formula was lightweight, comfortable to wear, and applied beautifully with rich, opaque color payoff. On me, it lasted for six and a half hours and left a stain behind.",A+
DOLCE AND GABBANA,SCARLETT (625),Lipstick,"a ‚Äúdeep red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, cool-toned red with a satin finish. It was intensely pigmented and yielded full color coverage. The color applied well without tugging on the lips, and it didn‚Äôt bleed or feather on me (though I‚Äôm not particularly prone to either, so keep that in mind). This shade wore well for almost seven hours and left a stain behind.",A+
MAC,RAIN OF FLOWERS,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúdeep violet with pink and blue pearl [with a Pearl finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a deepened, subtly warm-toned blackened violet purple with brighter violet pearl and shimmer. It was mostly opaque after two coats, but there was a hint of nail line at times. The consistency is slightly thin, almost watery, but it wasn‚Äôt too difficult to work with.",B+
MAC,ANTI-FASHION,NailPolish,"a ‚Äù
mid-tone dirty purple with pearl [with a Frost finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a dusty, muted purple-taupe with fine, iridescent purple shimmer and warm undertones. It was mostly opaque after I applied two coats of polish. The formula on this shade was slightly thick, so be careful when applying as it had a tendency to pool along the edges.",B
MAC,GIRL TROUBLE,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúsuper glitter pink [with a Pearl finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a slightly muted lavender with warmer, almost golden pearl/shimmer. It had semi-opaque pigmentation after two coats, while the consistency was slightly thin, but it dried down fairly quickly and didn‚Äôt streak or bubble. There were a few visible brush strokes, but most of them disappeared as it dried down.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,SMITTEN,Blush,"a ‚Äúpale creamy apricot.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, liight-medium peachy orange with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish.",A-
IT COSMETICS,WARM RADIANCE,Bronzer,"a ‚Äúradiant bronze.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium brown with subtle warm undertones and a champagne and bronze shimmer.",B+
DOLCE AND GABBANA,MANDORLA (125),Lipstick,"a ‚Äúbeige pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, muted peach with a creamy, natural finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage, and the consistency applied easily over the lips without tugging or dragging. It didn‚Äôt have too much slip, though, so the color stayed in place well. This shade lasted for four hours on me, which is average and not particularly long-wearing for me.",B+
DOLCE AND GABBANA,PETAL (135),Lipstick,"a ‚Äúneutral lilac rose.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, warm-toned rose with a natural sheen. It had nearly full color coverage, but you could see a shadow of my lip freckle. It glided on across the lips without dragging and felt comfortable to wear without being too slick. It wore well for four and a half hours on me.",A-
DOLCE AND GABBANA,DAHLIA (320),Lipstick,"a ‚Äúred wine.‚Äù It‚Äôs a deep, dark berry-red with subtle cool undertones and a satin finish. It had rich, intense color payoff that applied well without settling into lip lines or feathering over time. The consistency was lightly creamy, so it had good glide, but it didn‚Äôt slip around once applied. This shade lasted for seven hours and left a stain behind, though neither are surprising given how rich and dark this shade is.",A
MAC,DELICATE,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúpale sheer ballet pink [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a sheer, light pink with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. Despite the new formula and brush applicator, this shade still applied streakily. The consistency was thicker and didn‚Äôt seem to be quite as uneven once applied as it self-leveled to a degree, it didn‚Äôt have a great end result.",B
MAC,QUIET TIME,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúbeige nude [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, gray-beige with subtle neutral undertones and a cream finish. It was fully opaque after two coats of polish, and the consistency leaned slightly thick, but it didn‚Äôt show up in the application. It applied well without streaking or pooling along the edges.",A-
MAC,COFFEE BREAK,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúmidtone cool taupe [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, neutral taupe brown with a cream finish. The polish had full color coverage after two coats were applied, though it nearly opaque in a single coat. The texture leaned slightly thick, but I didn‚Äôt find it to be a problem during application, as the color didn‚Äôt pool along the edges or bubble.",A
MAC,NOCTURNELLE,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúrich true black [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a rich, medium-dark black with a cream finish. It was almost opaque in a single coat, though I applied two to be sure. The consistency wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin, so two coats does give it a glossier, plusher look once it dries down. There‚Äôs a natural shine to the dry down as well.",A
MAKEUP GEEK,ROMANCE,Blush,"a ‚Äúsoft rose with gold shimmer.‚Äù It‚Äôs a gold-shimmered, coral-orange with warm undertones and a soft, frosted finish.",A
MAC,EVER AMETHYST,Palette,"one of three new (and permanent!) shades available in the updated Mineralize Eyeshadow Duo range. (I will review the other two new duos soon!) The Mineralize Eyeshadow formula is supposed to be sheer when used dry, more intense when used with a dampened brush, as it is a wet/dry formula. Both halves of the duo had soft, slightly powdery, textures that felt finely-milled and were easy to blend on the lid. Using either shade with a dampened brush helped to minimize the powderiness of the formula.",B
SURRATT BEAUTY,AUR√©OLE,Highlighter,"a ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù shade. It‚Äôs a very light, gold-shimmered ivory with a soft, frosted finish.",A-
MAC,TROPICAL,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúblack with rainbow multi-pearl [with a Glitter finish].‚Äù It has a sheer, black-tinted base with small-sized light orange and orange-copper glitter (no rainbow glitter‚Äìwondering if the description is wrong). After two coats, it was mostly opaque, as the formula spread evenly across the nail‚Äìdidn‚Äôt have to play with the glittery bits to get them into place. It dried down to a slightly bumpy/textured finish, but a layer of top coat will smooth it out without having to apply multiple coats.",B+
MAC,SOIREE,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúsparkly light bronze gold [with a Pearl finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, warm-toned peachy beige with fine threads of metallic shimmer. It had opaque color coverage after two coats. The consistency was slightly thick but manageable without any major impact on application. It dried down to a lightly shiny finish. There were very slightly visible brush strokes, but only from certain angles.",A-
MAC,QUICK MILLION,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúgold glitter with large particle pink glitter [with a Glitter finish].‚Äù It has fine white gold shimmer and pearl with larger chunks of pink glitter. Some of the pink glitter ends up looking gold due to the other shimmer in the base. The consistency was slightly thicker, but the glitters spread fairly well without a lot of work. If you don‚Äôt like textured or bumpy nails, though, this one is noticeably chunky when it dries down. Even with two layers of top coat, it still felt a bit textured. It had semi-opaque color coverage after two coats. I‚Äôm not sure of a dupe for this one, so I‚Äôd love to hear your suggestions!",C+
MAKEUP GEEK,BARCELONA BEACH,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúmedium sand shade with a matte finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium brown with a subtle gray-tinge and a satin finish. It had a very slight sheen when I swatched‚Äìnot totally matte. The color payoff was nice, and the texture was soft, silky, and very blendable. I could see this shade being a real workhorse for some! On me, it wore well for eight hours before fading.",A
MAKEUP GEEK,GLASS SLIPPER,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúpale teal with slight shimmer.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, bluish-teal with a metallic finish. It had good pigmentation, and the texture was soft, but when I worked with on the lid, I felt like the product didn‚Äôt transfer as well from the brush to the lid so the color needed to be built up and packed on to a degree. Once on, the color wore well for eight hours before fading.",B
MAKEUP GEEK,POP CULTURE,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúvibrant iridescent lavender purple.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, cool-toned purple with a soft, frosted finish. It had decent color payoff, but it was a lot sheerer than most shades by the brand, though the texture was soft and blendable. The color was buildable in two to three layers. When worn, it wore well for eight hours before showing signs of fading.",B-
MAKEUP GEEK,ROCKSTAR,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúpale silver with purple iridescence.‚Äù It‚Äôs a cool-toned beige with a subtle pink-to-green duochrome. The duochrome is very subtle; sometimes it just looks more like a silvery beige applied, so it depends a lot on what else it is paired with. The texture was very soft and buttery, while the color payoff was good. This shade lasted for eight hours on me.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,SHARK BAIT,Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúblue based green with a matte finish.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, blue-leaning teal with a matte finish. The texture was really soft, but it was also noticeably powdery, so it was messier to use. The color payoff was semi-opaque, but it‚Äôs a shade that‚Äôs best patted on in two layers. I also felt like it performed better with a primer than on bare skin, as the color was never fully opaque on bare skin alone.",C+
MAC,INSTANT CRUSH,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúbright coral [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and a cream finish. It had opaque color coverage after two coats were applied, but the first coat was slightly streaky. Thankfully, the second coat helped to even everything out, so the end result was smooth and even.",A-
MAC,SAINT GERMAIN,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúlight cool pink [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a cool-toned, light pink with blue undertones and a cream finish. It had full color coverage after two coats of polish. The consistency was slightly thick but not troublesome to work with. The initial coat was somewhat streaky, but a second coat evened and smoothed everything out for better end results.",A-
MAC,SNOB,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúlight neutral pink [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, muted pink with neutral-to-warm undertones and a cream finish. It was mostly opaque after two coats, and the polish applied evenly and smoothly. The reformulation is warmer, more neutral, in color.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,RENDEZVOUS,Blush,"a ‚Äúrosy to medium pink with purple undertones.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, muted, cool-toned pink with a mostly matte finish.",A
YVES SAINT LAURENT,AVANT GARDE (8),Palette,"an earthy, green-themed set of five eyeshadows with mostly shimmery finishes. The texture of the eyeshadows is soft and feels almost like a cream product, but a couple of shades can be a little powdery, so the color payoff isn‚Äôt always as intense or as true-to-pan as marketed. The wear is also short of the 12-hour wear time claimed; I find this formula wears a bit shorter on me than many other powder eyeshadows, though not significantly shorter‚Äìwear time varies between seven and eight hours, but I get noticeable fading and occasional creasing (this depends on the shade). The texture is really compelling, but I would recommend wearing an eyeshadow base/primer if this is something you‚Äôve been considering; if you‚Äôre a no primer kind of person, I would skip.",B+
TOO FACED,LIKE BUTTAH,Lipstick,"the clear, colorless shade (as in, intentionally left clear!). It is less glossy than a more liquid-like lip balm, but it is also thinner. The consistency is lightly creamy, lightweight, and applies easily over the lips. It lasts an hour and a half on me.",B
TOO FACED,HUNNY BUNNY,Lipstick,"a sheer, peachy-beige. On my lips, it adds warmth and darkens my natural lip color just slightly with a smidgen of shine. It lasts an hour and a half on me.",C
TOO FACED,PEACHYKEEN,Lipstick,"a sheer peach. The major difference between this and Hunny Bunny is the undertone; this doesn‚Äôt have any beige in it, so it looks peachier‚Äìlike a mix of orange and pink. It lasts an hour and a half on me.",C
TOO FACED,MELTED BERRY,Lipstick,"a brightened, dark, fuchsia-red with cool, blue undertones and a lightly glossed finish. It had insanely rich color payoff‚Äìa little goes quite a long way. The consistency is lightweight and very easy to apply for even coverage as it begins as a liquid. This shade lasted for eight hours well, and then a very long and lingering stain persisted for hours after. It was neither hydrating nor drying.",A+
TOO FACED,MELTED FIG,Lipstick,"a purpled pink with subtle neutral-to-warm undertones and a glossy finish. It had fully opaque color coverage in a single pass, and it had a lightly glossy finish. This shade lasted for six and a half hours, and it left a stain behind. It was neither drying nor hydrating.",A+
TOO FACED,MELTED MARSHMALLOW,Lipstick,"a light-medium, yellow-toned pink with a softly glossed finish. It also had rich, intense color payoff like the other two shades. The consistency made it easy to apply and spread out the color for an even, smooth result. This shade wears for five and a half hours on me, but it settles slightly into lip lines after three hours of wear. It was neither hydrating nor drying to wear.",A
MAC,NEW ROMANCE,Blush,"a ‚Äúpeach.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, peachy-pink with a soft, champagne frosted finish and warm undertones.",B
NARS,HELL-BENT,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúlacquer red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium red with warm, orange undertones and a glossy, creamy finish. It had full color coverage after nearly one coat, but I did apply two just to be sure. The consistency wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin, so it flowed well across the nail without pooling along the edges. It dried down a bit faster than the average polish.",A+
NARS,OTHER SIDE,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúbitter chocolate.‚Äù It‚Äôs a blackened brown with subtle maroon undertones and a cream finish. It was fully opaque in almost one coat, though two were needed for complete opacity. The polish wasn‚Äôt too thick or too thin, and it was easy to apply‚Äìno streakiness or bubbling.",A+
NARS,CROSSROADS,NailPolish,"an ‚ÄúAfrican violet.‚Äù It‚Äôs a deepened, muted purple with a smokiness to it. It had a cream finish. The consistency was slightly thin, though it had full coverage after two coats, but it showed the texture of my natural nails just slightly (I have slightly ridged nails), so you‚Äôll want to use a base coat or ridge-filling base coat if you have similar natural nails. It applied without streaking, and it dried down to a naturally shiny finish.",A
CHANEL,EXALTATION (108),Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúbright pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium-dark pink with cool, blue undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff when applied dry, and it had semi-sheer color payoff when applied with a dampened brush‚Äìyes, worse pigmentation. It also applied unevenly when used with a dampened brush. The texture was powdery, though soft, but it really needed an eyeshadow primer to get true-to-pan color that didn‚Äôt immediately start fading away. Also, where I used a dampened brush, the powder darkened and hardened. On me, the color lasted for six hours before fading significantly (and it never looked as bright applied as it did in the pan).",F
CHANEL,PULSION (112),Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúdeep plum.‚Äù It‚Äôs a blackened purple with subtle warm undertones and a satin-matte finish. Like Exaltation, it was more pigmented applied dry, where it was semi-opaque. When I tried applying it with a dampened brush, it applied more unevenly and yielded only semi-sheer color payoff. It was difficult to get the color to transfer if I used a damp brush, and the surface of the powder hardened. This color at least lasted for eight hours before fading, so there was a little upside.",C
CHANEL,ADMIRATION (114),Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúgolden yellow.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, sunshine yellow with a soft, pearly sheen. The texture was quite powdery, but this one really sings when it is applied with a dampened brush, as you get really smooth, opaque color. Applied dry, it actually has quite a bit of pigmentation as well, but the texture has that powdery feel, so it is more prone to sheering out. This shade wore well for eight hours before fading.",B
MAKEUP GEEK,SECRET ADMIRER,Blush,"a ‚Äúlight orchid purple.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, light-medium, pink-lavender with cool, blue undertones and a satin-matte finish.",A
MAKEUP GEEK,FIRST LOVE,Blush,"a ‚Äúsoft pale ballerina pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, cool-toned pink with a soft shimmer",B+
BECCA COSMETICS,GUAVA,Blush,"a ‚Äúbright coral pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a muted, medium pink-coral with warm undertones and a natural finish on cheeks, near-matte finish on lips.",B
MAC,BLUSHING BERRY,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúmid-tone cool red.‚Äù It‚Äôs a brightened, medium-dark pinky-red with cool undertones and a glossy shine. It had semi-sheer color coverage that applied unevenly‚Äìit just looked splotchy once on. This shade wore well for four hours and left a very subtle stain behind. It wore fairly well for four hours, and after five, there was uneven fading and a splotchy ring of color left behind.",C-
MAC,BUBBLEGUM,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúsoft warm pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light, milky pink with warm, yellow undertones. It was semi-sheer applied to lips. The milkiness of the color made it harder to get an even application, as it would show ‚Äúlines‚Äù if you pressed your lips together and tended to gather in the lip lines. This shade wore well for four hours on me.",D+
MAC,GLORIOUS INTENT,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúwarm plum.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, raspberry pink with cool, blue undertones and a glossy shine. It was slightly splotch applied and had semi-sheer color payoff. It wore well for almost five hours before it started to fade from the center and, unfortunately, left that dreaded ring of color along the outer area of the lip. There was feathering that appeared after an hour and a half of wear.",C-
MAC,GWI-YO-MI,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúmid-tone raspberry.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, slightly muted, pink with subtle cool undertones. Applied against my skin tone, it almost turns warm-toned. It had semi-sheer color coverage, but this one applied more evenly compared to the others. The color lasted for almost four hours, but it didn‚Äôt feather as quickly as some of the other shades.",C-
MAC,SIMPLY WOW,Lipgloss,"a ‚Äúmid-tone cool mauve.‚Äù It‚Äôs a pinky-mauve with cool, blue undertones. It had semi-sheer pigmentation, which didn‚Äôt apply too evenly‚Äìit settled and gathered into lip lines. This shade lasted for just over four hours but there was feathering visible after four hours with a very faint stain along the edges of the lips for another hour.",C+
MAKEUP GEEK,LOVE AFFAIR,Blush,"a medium-dark, pink-coral with warm undertones and a satin finish.",A
MAKEUP GEEK,HANKY PANKY,Blush,"a medium-dark, cool-toned pink with a satin finish.",A-
MAC,BLACK IVY,Eyeliner,"a ‚Äúblackened green.‚Äù It‚Äôs a dark, bluish-teal with very fine teal micro-shimmer over a semi-matte base. It had fairly good color payoff, and the consistency was creamy, lightweight, and easy to apply along the lash line. It wore well for ten hours on my lower lash line without fading or smudging.",A-
MAC,NIGHTSHADE,Eyeliner,"a ‚Äúblackened plum.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark plummy purple with an almost golden, pearly sheen. It had warmer undertones and a soft sheen. The color payoff, unfortunately, was pretty poor. The left part of the swatch is the product applied with an angled brush as if to mimic applying a single stroke across the lash line, and it just doesn‚Äôt seem to apply smoothly or evenly. This is usually an issue I see with the more glittery shades (like with Copperthorn) with the Fluidline formula, so I was disappointed by this one. On the upside, this shade wore well for ten hours.",C
INGLOT,#401,Highlighter,"a very light, pale pink with subtle, cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. There seems to be just the slightest bit of micro-shimmer scattered through the powder, but applied, it really looks mostly matte. The texture of this is incredibly soft but very powdery (more powdery than the Sculpting Powder). I think my skin tone swallows this shade up quite a bit, so unfortunately, I don‚Äôt think you can glean much from the photo of it applied. Even though it doesn‚Äôt seem to visibly change my skin color or tone, it does give the skin a slightly smoother look‚Äìvery finished. It seemed to last about seven and a half hours on me. Despite its lightness, I didn‚Äôt feel like it looked chalky on me (but it may on deeper complexions).",B
INGLOT,#504,Bronzer,"Ia medium-dark, rosy taupe with subtle, neutral-to-warm undertones and a satin-matte finish. It had good color payoff, but the texture is more powdery, so it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äústick‚Äù quite as well. If you normally wear a liquid or cream foundation, and then apply it, I think you won‚Äôt notice the texture so much. It is very blendable, though, which is a must for a contour powder. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading.",B+
MELT COSMETICS,SPACE CAKE,Lipstick,"a bluish-gray with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage. This was actually the creamiest and easiest to apply shade out of the six I bought, though I wouldn‚Äôt describe it as creamy‚Äìit is still a stiffer, drier matte texture that will pull and drag during application, just less so compared to the other shades. It lasted for eight hours and left behind a stain‚Äìcaution, the stain looks a bit like a bruise. It was somewhat dry while worn.",B+
MELT COSMETICS,STUPID LOVE,Lipstick,"a bright, neon magenta fuchsia with cool, blue undertones and a matte finish. It had full, opaque color payoff. The texture was somewhat dry and stiff, so it pulled at the lip and dragged as it applied. Once on, it was able to look even and smooth in terms of color coverage, and the color lasted for eight hours and left behind a strong, fuchsia stain. It was drying over time, unfortunately.",B
MELT COSMETICS,SUMMER!,Lipstick,"a light, peachy-orange with warm undertones and a matte finish. I had to apply this one on four separate occasions to get it to apply decently on my lips, because it just dragged so badly. It seemed to get slightly less dry as it wore down, but it was a challenge to apply from the tube. This shade lasts about six hours on me but looks horrible after three hours‚Äìit cracks, settles and pulls into lip lines, and just looks so, so dry and my lips felt somewhat dry after wearing this.",C
SHISEIDO,ESMARALDA (BL 620),Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúdeep, elegant aqua blue.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium-dark, muted blue with a slight teal leaning and a frosted finish. It had good pigmentation and applied easily over the lid, and the wear was just over eleven hours in total.",B+
SHISEIDO,SUDACHI (GR 619),Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äújuicy green.‚Äù It‚Äôs a medium, warm-toned green with a soft, frosted finish. It looks almost cooler-toned if applied at full intensity, but if sheered out, it looks warmer and warmer as the yellow undertone gets pulled out. This shade had good color payoff, and it wore well for eleven hours on me before starting to slightly crease.",B+
SHISEIDO,MIST (WT 901),Eyeshadow,"a ‚Äúpearl.‚Äù It‚Äôs an iridescent, pink-tinged white with a very sparkly, high-frost finish. It had fairly good pigmentation, but this shade was more prone to applying sheerer than really opaque, so you may find two layers necessary for opaque color, if desired. This color works well for highlighting in the inner tear duct or as a wash of color on the lid to brighten the eyes. It wore well for ten and a half hours before starting to crease.",B
MAC,SKIN,NailPolish,"a ‚Äúlight peach beige [with a Cream finish].‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, muted peach with warm undertones and a cream finish.",B-
GIVENCHY,BEIGE CARACO (107),Lipstick,"Äúmedium peach beige.‚Äù It‚Äôs a slightly-lighter-than-medium peach with beige and warm undertones. The finish is luminous with a soft sheen. The consistency was lightweight, very creamy and smooth, but it had a little more slip than darker and more mid-tone shades in the range. It was mostly opaque, and for as much creaminess/slip this had, it only very, very lightly showed ‚Äúlines‚Äù if you pressed your lips together. This shade lasted four hours on me.",B+
GIVENCHY,BEIGE DESHABILLE (108),Lipstick,"Äúmuted light peach beige.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium, peachy beige with subtle, warm undertones. It had mostly opaque pigmentation, but it is one of the sheerer shades I‚Äôve come across within the formula. It is a lot less forgiving applied as well; one of the qualities I really like about the Le Rouge formula is how much smoother lips usually look with it on, but my lips look almost crumbly at times with this shade. A lot of lighter shades, such as this one, have similar issues, but it is always disappointing when a brand doesn‚Äôt improve upon it. It has a bit more slip than average, and it does show ‚Äúlines‚Äù if you press your lips together. This shade only lasted three hours on me.",B-
GIVENCHY,ROSE RUBAN (211),Lipstick,"a ‚Äúpale pink.‚Äù It‚Äôs a light-medium pink with neutral-to-warm undertones‚Äìit almost has a gray-ish cast. It had semi-opaque color coverage, but it suffered from the same problems as Beige Deshabille did‚Äìuneven, not smooth, appearance once on, and it, too, will show some ‚Äúlines‚Äù where the color will gather on itself if you press your lips together. This color wore well for three hours when I tested it.",B-
BARE ESCENTUALS,THE WISH LIST,Palette,"12 neutral-hued eyeshadows in a variety of finishes. It is housed in a fairly slim, plastic compact with a large mirror inside. If you like lighter, warmer neutrals and don’t already have them well-represented in your stash, it’s certainly a palette to consider. On the other hand, as there are numerous palettes that have been launched, there are likely many who already have these colors in their collections (this palette also included several repeats from past bareMinerals shades). Regardless of similarity to past and present neutral palettes, I would have liked to have seen more mid-tone shades and less very light all within the same palette–I feel like it would have made the palette more versatile.",B
SEPHORA,WARM,Palette,28 eyeshadows in a “warm” color story. I would agree with that description–it is definitely a warm-toned palette–with a lot of mid-tone and medium-dark neutrals in shades of brown and more brown. There were two major misses in the palette (one of which was bizarre that it was a miss) with some that were easy to work with and others that were somewhere in the middle.,B-
CHANEL,CANDEUR ET EXPERIENCE (268),Palette,"three shades of brown with a pop of warm red with mostly matte finishes. The texture of the four shades is firmer and thinner compared to most of the recent Eyeshadow Quads (it reminds me more of the previous formula in the quads), and I found it applied and worked better in practice than it seemed like it would from initial swatches. The colors were more buildable and were quite blendable on the lid, in spite of the firmer press in the pan. All of the shades lasted eight hours before starting to fade and lightly crease.",B+
MAC,SWISS CHOCOLATE,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark brown with soft, warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had good color payoff, though the texture was thinner and more firmly pressed in the pan, which made it a bit harder to blend and diffuse on bare skin, as it took more effort to soften the edges. This shade wore well for eight hours on me. ",B+
COLOURED RAINE,MOMENTS,Eyeshadow,"a deep red-brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good color coverage–just a tinge shy of fully opaque–with a soft, lightly powdery consistency that was much more blendable in practice than anticipated. (This was the same experience I had with the mattes in the brand’s eyeshadow palette.) The eyeshadow started to fade after eight and a half hours on me.",A-
TARTE,BURIED TREASURE,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette for the holidays that features 10 shades in the “new Rainforest of the Sea formula.” Per Tarte, the formula is supposed to be blendable, “velvety,” and “primes lids for payoff.” They have a very smooth, velvety texture with moderate powderiness and a tendency to “melt” on the lids, which meant shorter wear due to noticeable fading between four and six hours. That same powderiness also resulted in color that sheered out a lot and tended to make the lid appear drier, and it was harder to layer the mattes on top of each other without then lifting whatever was underneath (or nearby). There was potential here, but unless applied over a tacky base, it was a miss.",F
MAC,APRICOT BLEND,Palette," a peach and copper eyeshadow with a brown eyeliner. The Studio Sculpt Shade & Line Eyeshadows can be used wet “for a defined look with super-saturated colour” or dry for “medium buildable coverage.” When you work with Apricot Blend dry, it can be powdery and the two eyeshadow shades had a tendency to sheer out during application very easily, so I felt like you really had to layer and pack on the eyeshadows to get them to stay. Working with them damp made the color truer-to-pan and created less fall out/excess powder. The eyeliner shade was stiff and much more difficult to use, regardless of application method. Apricot Blend wore well for eight hours before fading.",B-
URBAN DECAY,VORTEX,Eyeshadow,"a smoky black with green shift and gold 3-D sparkle. It’s a medium-dark, olive green set over a warmer, bronzy-brown base with lighter green and gold shimmer. This one seemed the smoothest and had the least amount of sparkle, even though it had a lot of sheen. It was semi-sheer when applied dry, and it was fully opaque when applied damp. It wore well for eight hours before fading and had almost no fall out.",B+
URBAN DECAY,VICE 4,Palette,"twenty, new and limited edition eyeshadows, just in time to kick off a long, holiday season of palettes. If you have a great disdain for Urban Decay’s micro-glitter or sparkle, then I would avoid this palette like the plague; eleven shades have micro-glitter, per the brand, and one more has “tonal sparkle.” Some are noticeable in practice, other shades have less and most sparkles drop during application so there isn’t as much fall out during wear, but I would recommend an adhesive primer for best results and minimal fall out. If you have a lot of Urban Decay palettes, you may find that there is more overlap with past iterations (even though these are technically new!). There are some really great shades in this palette, like Underhand, Discreet, Harlot, and Robbery, but there are some duds, like Grip, Flame, Low, and Crowbar.",B
GIORGIO ARMANI,GREEN IRON (06),Eyeshadow,"a warm, olive bronze with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It was richly pigmented with a very smooth consistency that never seemed watery. The color blended out easily, whether you wanted an opaque all-over lid color with diffused edges or a wash of color. This shade wore well for fourteen and a half hours on me before fading.",A
GUCCI,COSMIC DECO,Palette,"set of smokier shades that leans warm in tone. Three of the four shades are quite shimmery, and those three performed better than the one more matte shade, unfortunately. I’m always surprised to see brands miss on a matte black eyeshadow, which should be a very basic color and one where blendability is really necessary for it to perform well and be as versatile as a basic should be.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,TAKE TWO,Eyeshadow,"a dark, olive green with warm, golden undertones and a nearly metallic sheen. It was richly pigmented with a soft, smooth, and lightly dense texture that was extremely easy to use and apply to the lid. Of all the new Foiled eyeshadows, this was the best across the board, and it even wore a bit better and made it to eight hours before creasing!",A
SEPHORA,SNAKESKIN DRESS (02),Eyeshadow,"a shimmering golden khaki. It’s a warm, olive green with a golden olive shimmer-sheen. It has a frosted finish and brown undertones.",A
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,THE FREE SPIRIT (224),Palette,"twenty eyeshadows with two being repeats (though not sure exactly from what palette) and eighteen being brand new. It’s an interesting mix of shades; it’s not your typical holiday assortment with a lot of golds and neutrals, nor is it full of jewel-tones. It skews a bit lighter, and there could be more mid-tone shades in it, but I liked it overall. I think if you like the Marc Jacobs eyeshadow formula, you’ll probably like this set. Overall, the eyeshadows have good color payoff, soft and blendable textures, and are long-wearing.",A-
ANASTASIA,LAVISH,Palette,"ten eyeshadows (0.031 oz. each), brow pencil (0.013 oz.), black eyeliner (0.01 oz.), dual-ended brush, and tweezers. It definitely offers plenty of product for your money. This review is focused primarily on the eyeshadows, but I did really like the tweezers–good grip, spring, and squeeze mechanisms so tweezing was easy, in addition to the eyeshadows. Overall, the really high-frost, high-shimmer shades were nice–soft, buttery, and nicely pigmented. The more matte shades were a little powdery but had good payoff generally. When I wore the eyeshadows, they wore well for almost eight hours and showed slight fading after eight hours of wear.",B
COLOUR POP,PERCEPTION,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette that contains 16 shades from warm beige to deep burgundy and a mix of finishes from matte to metallic. The quality was good across the board with most shades applying better on the lid than merely swatched (particularly true with the metallics, which I found applied better on the lid as the area was smaller and my natural inclination toward technique was to press and pat on). It’s a versatile palette with some pops of color that integrated well with the other shades in different ways.",A
SURRATT BEAUTY,FLAMME,Blush,"a bright, medium-dark orange with warm, red undertones and a gold, frosted shimmer.",A
MAC,PERFECTLY POISED,Palette,"a two-in-one product that features a section that’s described as a “creamy beige with pinkish purplish sheen” and a larger area described as a “bronzy coral with golden tones.” This particular Mineralize Skinfinish wore a little better on me than others, topping in at seven hours, which isn’t great wear but longer than some other shades of Mineralize powders for me.  There is significant emphasis of pores due to the outer shade, which has a very frosted, metallic finish, so when that is used alone or mixed in, pores seem to be at the forefront.",B
MAC,SOLAR RAY,Blush,"a peach and gold melange. The colors swirled together create a warm, peach-shimmered orange; reminded me of apricots. The individual shades are a orange-gold and a pink-peach.",C+
LAURA GELLER,PINK GRAPEFRUIT,Blush,"slightly muted, medium-dark rosy copper with warm undertones and a frosted, lightly metallic finish.",B
MAC,HIGHLIGHT THE TRUTH,Highlighter,"a soft bronze coral with golden shimmer. It’s a medium, peachy orange with warm undertones and a frosted sheen.",B+
MAC,HIGHLY ILLOGICAL,Highlighter,"a subdued, medium-dark copper-brown with warm undertones and a soft, pearly sheen.",B+
LANCOME,ROSE TWINKLE,Palette,"three silky-cushion cream powders that have a buildable glow. The highlighters were more pigmented, but the finish wasn’t nearly as metallic unless more heavily layered, as the shine and shimmer seemed to dissipate as I blended and worked the powder into the skin–it was as if the powder melted on my skin, so while the coverage remained the same, the glow factor could be built up. The texture of the powders was amazing–so silky–and easy to work with.",A
BOBBI BROWN,PINK QUARTZ,Highlighter,"a soft, warm pink glow. It’s a muted, medium-dark taupe-brown with warm undertones and pink and bronze shimmer that gives it a more metallic sheen.",A-
LAURA MERCIER,INDISCRETION,Highlighter,"a light-medium, gold-shimmered rosy copper with warm undertones and a frosted, luminous sheen.",A-
LAURA MERCIER,L'AMOUR EXOTIQUE,Highlighter,"a new, limited edition palette with four highlighters–two are new to me and two are also available in the permanent range. I found all four shades to be consistent with the permanent formula, which has a slightly drier, almost looser texture to the touch (not uncommon for this type of formula) with medium to opaque coverage that lasted between seven and eight hours on me.",B+
LAURA MERCIER,SPELLBOUND,Highlighter,"a soft rose-gold. It’s a warm, champagne-shimmered copper–it doesn’t really look pink on me, like a rose gold, it’s a little warmer, more orange. On cooler skin tones, the rosiness may be more apparent.",A-
MAYBELLINE,NUDE REBELLION (201),Highlighter,"peachy-bronze with a champagne sheen and metallic finish. This one is more metallic, and it did emphasize pores somewhat, depending on the angle and how the light hit the skin. It lasted six hours on my skin before looking patchy. It is rather sheer on cheeks, and even when built up, gives merely a slight warmth to the natural skin tone (fairer skin tones may see more color).",B
MAC,TALK OF THE TOWN,Blush,"a warm brown base with yellow bronze. It’s a soft, peach-pink with a frosted, metallic finish. The texture was a little loose and glittery; it didn’t feel as smooth as it could have been. On cheeks, it can emphasize pores slightly, but if you use a dense brush and really buff it in, then a pretty, somewhat metallic glow, comes forward and doesn’t emphasize pores. This shade will only add a little color on very fair complexions but mostly shimmer/sheen on medium and deeper skin tones. The biggest downfall of this was that it was almost all faded/patchy by the sixth hour.",B-
ZOEVA,ROSE GOLDEN,Palette,"a contouring powder, highlighter, and blush. It comes in a slim, “rose gold” cardboard palette where each shade is a good-size for travel but still large enough to accommodate many different-sized face brushes. The quality of the palette is nice, and I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a more aptly named highlighter, though this isn’t going to be the most universally-applicable palette, so I would have loved to have seen iterations of “rose gold” for darker skin tones, too.
",B+
HUDA BEAUTY,GOLDEN SAND,Palette,"one cream highlighter and three powder highlighters housed in a slim, cardboard palette (no mirror). Each highlighter has quite a bit of product–it’s a substantial size for a cheek palette. The brand released two versions (the other is Pink Sand), though I was surprised they weren’t more dissimilar. The Pink Sand version is supposed to be lighter skin tones with the Golden Sand version for medium and dark skin tones.",B-
LE METIER DE BEAUTE,WHISPER,Highlighter,"a soft, peachy-beige with a frosted sheen. It has definite warm undertones, and the finish isn’t subtle.",A
COLOUR POP,HELLO PRETTY,Palette,"two cheek products, three eyeshadows, and two lip colors. It is presently sold out (I’m writing this the day before), but there’s supposed to be a restock for the Hello Kitty collection at 10AM PST today (11/16), so you might want to keep your eye out if it’s on your list!",A-
BARE ESCENTUALS,THE MAGIC ACT,Palette,"six eyeshadows, one highlighter, and three blushes in a fold-up palette. Each eyeshadow is 0.04 oz., while the Luminizer is 0.09 oz. and each blush is 0.10 oz. It’s a nice palette for someone who’s looking for a range of warm-toned neutrals in a variety of finishes paired with blush. There are a lot of neutral-themed palettes out there now, so this might not be a must-have, but at least this one is high quality and the added pairing of blushes makes it slightly different. If you’re a regular Ready fan, you may find this contains too many shades you already have as there are a few from previous holiday sets and/or permanent range.",A
URABN DECAY,SHATTERED,Palette,"five eyeshadows, one lip color, one eyeliner, two blushes, and one highlighter. Each eyeshadow is 0.03 oz., each blush is 0.05 oz., the highlighter is 0.05 oz., Super-Saturated High Gloss Lip Color is 0.10 oz., and the 24/7 Glide-On Eye Pencil is 0.03 oz. There is $54 worth of eyeshadows, $9 worth of blush (Urban Decay doesn’t currently sell powder blushes, so I took the price-per-ounce for the Naked Flush palette, which is the most comparable product I could think of), $19 worth of lip color, and $14 worth of eyeliner. The kit is at least $96 in value (the blush/highlighter could make the value higher if they were actually sold separately).",A-
VISEART,HIGHLIGHT/SCULPT (01),Palette,"a six-pan blush palette that is the same size (and contains the same amount) as the eyeshadow palettes. It comes in a black plastic compact with a clear lid. The highlighting shades are on the left, while the contouring shades are on the right. The formula used for the highlighters is really nice–dense, buttery, and blendable–and feels similar to their shimmery eyeshadows, while the formula used for the contour powders is more like the powder blush formula. The formula is supposed to “apply seamlessly” and have “sheer to fuller coverage.” Generally, the pigmentation was buildable from medium coverage, fairly blendable, and long-wearing (eight to nine hours); I only had issues with the two deeper contour shades, as they weren’t as easily blended and diffused on the skin as the other four shades. Unfortunately, that accounts for 1/3 of the palette being problematic, and at this price point, that’s likely to be a deal-breaker.",B+
BECCA COSMETICS,CHRISSY TEIGEN,Palette,"two highlighters, a blush, and a bronzer housed in a large, square-shaped palette. One of the four products is a repeat from the permanent line (Rose Gold), while the other three are exclusive to the palette. It’s well worth some consideration if you’re a fan of warmer cheek products in hues of peach, pink, and coral and like your shimmer. The four shades coordinated well with each other and layered nicely, blended without issue, and lasted well on the skin.",A-
FENTY BEAUTY,GIRL NEXT DOOR/CHIC FREAK,Palette,"a light, pinky-peach with a frosted finish and a deeper, more metallic peachy coral. The left side wasn’t as reflective as the right side, which had more visible sparkle and did emphasize my skin’s natural texture. Some might enjoy the intensity and shine of the right side even if it doesn’t have a smoothing finish, while others are loathe to draw attention to their skin’s natural texture. If you’re part of the latter, I don’t think that this formula (generally) will be the best fit.",B
BARE ESCENTUALS,GLAMOUR NOW,Palette,"a lot of good things going for it. The best product is definitely the eyeshadow quad, which is good across the board. The luminizer is nice but does somewhat emphasize pores and didn’t wear as well as I’d like it to. The blush wore well for eight hours, felt soft and blendable, and had good color payoff. The finishing powder was just so-so; didn’t knock it out of the park as far as smoothing prowess went. The lipgloss is sheer, non-sticky, and then disappeared before the two-hour mark. I was extremely disappointed in the two brushes, as they were very scratchy and rough against the skin.",B+
NARS,NON-FICTION,Palette,"a palette with two blushes and a pressed setting powder, plus a miniature-sized lipgloss and mascara. I wish they had opted for a third blush rather than the pressed powder, because the texture of the powder felt like cardboard–it was stiff, dry, and did absolutely nothing on the skin because next to no product came off of the pan to begin with. The blushes were decent, and if you aren’t too concerned about intensity levels dry vs. damp, they’re pretty easy to use and work together well. The gloss had good coverage and didn’t appear streaky, but it pulled into lip lines quite a bit. This was definitely one of the less impressive offerings from NARS for this holiday season.",D
MAC,MISS CUPCAKE/TOMATO,Palette,"double-ended, cream-based stick that’s supposed to work for highlighting, contouring, bronzing, or blushing. It is supposed to have buildable, blendable color and can be worn over bare skin or foundation. One side is more shimmery, while the other is darker and more natural (but still has a sheen from the creamier consistency) in finish.
",B+
REVLON ,RACY ROSE (008),Blush,a warm-toned coral with a hint of pink and a frosted sheen.,C-
CHANEL,REFLEX (82),Blush,a medium-dark coral-orange with warm undertones and gold shimmer.,A-
BENEFIT,CHEEKY SWEET SPOT,Palette,"six powder blushes and a cream highlighter–all shades from Benefit’s permanent line-up in a metal tin. I found the color of Bella Bamba and CORALista to be different in the palette compared to my standalone versions, with CORALista being very different and Bella Bamba more “within variation” that you might expect over the years and the like. The change in color may appeal to you, or it may disappoint you, depending on the color you prefer. Most of Benefit’s blushes run rather warm-toned, and there are a lot of warm pink/coral variations here, so it may feel redundant if you are on the hunt for a really diverse blush palette. The packaging is ridiculously bulky and clunky–all I could think of was, “Why is this so heavy and noisy?” A few readers mentioned they easily depotted the blushes from the palette, so hopefully that’s an option for others. It’s unnecessarily large and nowhere near travel-friendly, and of course, it is very decked out in holiday-print, so it may feel out of place in April.
",A-
BENEFIT,ROCKATEUR,Blush,"a soft, peachy coral with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had good color coverage with a smooth, moderately dense consistency that wasn’t difficult to pickup with my brush, and it blended out nicely on my skin. This shade lasted for eight hours on me. This is the lightest version I’ve come across of Rockateur–substantially lighter than the single I have and then even lighter compared to the last palette I have it in.",B+
MAC,"SEA ME, HEAR ME",Blush,"a beige pink. It’s a muted, warm-toned coral with a satiny sheen. The texture was incredibly soft, finely-milled, and smooth, but it never veered powdery; it was extremely blendable on the skin, and it had good pigmentation that was buildable. It wore well for almost eight hours on me before starting to fade.",A-
MAC,MAKE YOU MINE,Blush,"described as a “dirty salmon.” It’s a muted, medium copper-plum with a very fine gold shimmer-sheen–it’s more like a soft, satin finish.",A+
COLOUR POP,MEDIUM-DARK/DEEP DARK,Palette,"three Super Shock Cheek shades and three Lippie Stix shades. It is designed for darker skin, though two shades overlap with the kit for lighter skin tones (Parasol and Thistle) — I would have loved for them to have not repeated personally! The products are of good quality or better, and they’re easy to use, work well, and wear nicely.",A
MAC,COPPER FACE COMPACT,Palette,"a powder highlighter and blush. Both shades are repromotes, though Whisper of Gilt is one of those shades that many wanted to make a return. The Extra Dimension Skinfinishes are supposed to have 10-hour wear, while the Extra Dimension Blush formula is supposed to have six-hour wear.",A
MAC,ABLAZE,Eyeshadow," a mid-tone coral with a matte finish. It’s a reddish-tinged, medium-dark orange with a matte finish.",B+
COLOUR POP,SHOP,Eyeshadow,"a “rusty coral in a matte finish.” It’s a muted, reddish coral with warm, orange undertones and a mostly matte finish. The base is matte, but there is a very tiny bit of shimmer in it when you look closely, though it looks matte from a normal viewing distance.",A-
ZOEVA,MATTE,Palette,"ten warm-toned, matte eyeshadows housed in a slim, cardboard palette. The eyeshadow formula is supposed to be “highly pigmented” and “easy to blend.” Overall, the eyeshadow formula was pigmented, silky, blendable, and long-wearing. It was an easy palette to apply, use, and wear, and the shades coordinated with each other well. It is going to work best for someone who likes richer, warmer shades along with matte finishes; it would also work as a complementary palette to a more shimmer-heavy palette to add more versatile transition and crease shades. There were two shades that could have applied better and been less powdery, though they were workable and if you normally use primer, the shortcomings were even less apparent.
",A-
URBAN DECAY,SPIKE,Eyeshadow,"a dark orange with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had intense pigmentation with a very smooth, velvety texture that wasn’t too soft or too firm in the pan. I had no issues with fallout, but the eyeshadow was still perfectly blendable on the skin along the edges. It applied evenly and adhered for a solid eight hours to bare skin.
",A
COLOURED RAINE,BEAUTY RUST,Palette,"a new, limited edition palette filled with warm neutrals. There are five matte eyeshadows and one sparkling one. I saved this one for last, as I expected it to be the most foolproof, but it was a struggle, even over primer. On its own, there were issues with colors dusting off the lid and lifting away, and over primer, the powders seeped into my skin and looked dotted, patchy–like my pores were eating the eyeshadows and darkening, which resulted in a nice, polka dotted effect that was zero percent flattering.",B-
CIATE,CHLOE MORELLO,Palette,"a slim eyeshadow palette with 15 eyeshadows along with a miniature-sized liquid lipstick and mascara. Overall, it’s a nice palette for someone who likes warmer neutrals and mixing them with pinks and plums. The liquid lipstick is quite nice, too, but for those who want 100% transfer-proof liquid lipstick, it’s not one of those–more of a velvet matte where there is more comfort but some transfer and shorter wear (but still long, relative to traditional lipstick).",B
LANCOME,AUDA[CITY] IN PARIS,Palette,"a smokier set of shades that mixes cool and warm undertones to create a gradient of color ranging from light gold to smoky purple to matte black. I think the color combination is more unusual but still familiar. The textures were very, very similar to Urban Decay Naked Smoky to me (all owned by the same parent) — the mattes had a thinner, slightly dusty, “noisy” texture; there’s a distinct sound that I can hear when my brush passes across the surface of them that I don’t notice with a lot of other eyeshadows. It applied better than it swatched, and the product seems more buildable than anything else. I felt like my eyelids look a little drier with this formula on. The palette is best paired with your go-to primer, as it will help you get truer-to-pan color and greater intensity, though the wear with most shades was near to the eight-hour mark without a primer. I have a few of these shades as singles from several years ago (so I don’t know if they have reformulated at some point in the last four or five years), but the versions in the palette are less dense and drier to me. The palette itself is large and feels a little bulky, but it contains a lot so I think it is travel-friendly if you don’t midn the weight or are going for a longer trip; and I consistently had a little struggle getting it open (just doesn’t seem to have a good groove to open for my finger/hand size, I guess!).",C+
LORAC,MEGA PRO (ORIGINAL),Palette,"32 eyeshadows–16 matte, 16 shimmer from white to black to plum to teal. The palette is very warm-toned–only a handful of shades are neutral to cool–and it is a more light to mid-tone palette, but a lot of the shades run together. I don’t think the color composition is as good as it could be. Overall, the formula used in these eyeshadows had a very soft, silky feel, but it was soft enough that it is powdery and lots of excess product gets kicked up in the palette but also drops below the lid if you aren’t careful.",B
INGLOT,#122R RAINBOW EYESHADOW PAN,Palette,"a trio of warm, yellow-toned browns that range from a dirty orange to terracotta to medium-dark brown.  The quality of this trio was quite good across the board, with the bottom shade being really impressive.  All three shades had nice pigmentation, soft textures, and none of them were too powdery.  I had no trouble applying or blending out the colors on the lid, and they do work well together.  I might opt for a lighter inner lid color, just to provide more contrast.  When I wore these three shades together, they lasted seven and a half hours well with some minor fading becoming apparent after eight and a half hours.",A-
VISEART,NEUTRAL MATTE (01),Palette,"twelve matte (well, mostly) neutral eyeshadows. When it comes to their eyeshadow palettes, the Neutral Matte palette is considered the “base” where this is the one you start with, and the other palettes build on this one, particularly the shimmery ones like Bridal Satin, Sultry Muse, and Paris Nude (though you can get looks out of them as is, but you have to love your shimmer). According to the brand, the formula is supposed to be pigmented, smooth, blendable, and long-wearing, and the palettes/eyeshadows are made in small batches (which is what is said to be the reason for why restocking can take awhile). All of the shades in the palette were very soft and silky to the touch, finely-milled, and fairly pigmented, though some shades were more semi-opaque and buildable, while others were quite pigmented from the get-go. A few of the shades are more semi-matte to satin-matte, where they lack the flatness of a truly matte eyeshadow but look like a “natural matte” finish applied, so even some of the lighter shades are less prone to looking dry or chalky on the skin. They all wore well for nine hours on me before fading (no primer). Its greatest strength to me is really that they adhere and apply to bare skin without the necessity of primer, and they tended to blend easily without turning patchy or uneven. It’s worth taking a look at if you’re in need of more matte, warm-toned neutrals in your stash, but if you’ve already stocked up on many a neutral palette in the last few years, these are dupable (182 dupes across the twelve shades).",A-
ANASTASIA,AMREZY,Palette,"ten shades ranging from shimmery gold to medium matte black. Each eyeshadow is 0.025 oz. It’s a so-so palette with a few nice shades, some less impressive ones. There are no total misses, but the two brighter shades didn’t translate as richly as they looked in the pan/swatch applied–I couldn’t get that green to pop no matter how many times I patted it on! The wear was good, though, across the board, and most of the eyeshadows wore well for eight to nine hours before fading.
",B
ANASTASIA,SHADOW COUTURE,Palette,"twelve eyeshadows. Five of the twelve shades are available as individual shades from the brand’s permanent range of eyeshadows. They’re housed in slim cardboard with an interior mirror and dual-ended brush (which is okay, nothing amazing but usable). Some shades are good, some are so-so, and a few are misses. For the price point, you may find that using primer to solve at least half of the issues I experienced with some of the under-performing shades and make it still “worth it” as a result. The most troublesome shades were Heirloom (brings down the palette from B range to near C+ range!), Spoiled, and Chic.",B-
MAKEUP GEEK,SIDEKICK,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark copper brown with warm, reddish undertones and a matte finish. It had fairly good color payoff, while the texture was soft and smooth without being too dusty or too powdery. The color applied well to bare skin and blended out without issue. The color started to fade after eight hours of wear.",B+
MAC,MISCHIEF MINX,Palette,"a set of warm, shimmery neutral shades that includes eight eyeshadows and one highlighter. The palette features a new eyeshadow formula with four finishes–Satin Shine, Smooth Pearl, Foiled Shadow, and Creamy Matte–that are supposed to have a “creamy, silky texture with superior colour payoff” along with a powder highlighter that’s described as “lightweight” and has “just the right amount of pearl and pop.”",B
HUDA BEAUTY,MAUVE,Palette,"a mix of warm pinks, plums, and burgundy in matte and shimmer finishes. The eyeshadows are just shy of most full-sized eyeshadows (0.039 oz. vs. 0.05 oz.), and the palette itself is the size of typical eyeshadow quads. Per the brand, the formula is supposed to be highly pigmented with a smooth and blendable texture.",B
COLOUR POP,SHE,Palette,"a warm-toned palette featuring shades of peach, pink, and plum with pops of coral and copper. A few of the more shimmery shades were drier and looser and had sheerer coverage than is typical with ColourPop, and then there was one shade (Gal) that was so glittery that it was very difficult to use it without an adhesive base. The color scheme certainly worked, though I longed for more contrast or better lighter tones to mix with the more mid-tone shades.",B-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,SCANDALUST,Palette,"a deeper, warm neutral palette with a pop of red. The eyeshadow formula is supposed to have “lasting, velvety-rich pigment.” Five of the seven shades were quite pigmented, but two fell short in terms of pigmentation and one had a drier, looser texture that made it harder to use. Overall, it was a solid palette of warmer neutrals that had a good mix of light and dark shades for versatility.",B+
KAT VON D,SERPENTINA,Palette,"eight eyeshadows and one loose eyeshadow. I think everything comes together decently on the lid, but there are four weaker shades in the palette, which is nearly half. The sheerer, more dusty nature of Bloodmilk and Venom seemed problematic when swatched, but they actually applied and built-up better in practice than I expected (particularly Venom), which is partially due to my lids being more normal in skin type, while my arm is dry. I was surprised that Hieroglyph was weak at all, because it’s rare that a brand misses on a copper-hued shade. In a way, these are replicated in the Metal Crush range, though not the same in formula or fully dupes, but they share the more jewel-toned nature of the Metal Crush range. I would spend my money there, rather than this palette, if you really want richly pigmented, long-wearing, and blendable eyeshadow.",B-
HUDA BEAUTY,WARM BROWNS,Palette,"a warm-toned neutral palette with eight matte shades and one shimmery shade. The eyeshadows were quite good, and my only “con” was that I felt the denser consistency of the lone shimmery shade didn’t work quite as well with all the mattes (not uncommon) and the darkest matte could have been more pigmented (but it was buildable and worked better in practice than swatched).",A-
ANASTASIA,MODERN RENAISSANCE,Palette,"14 eyeshadows that come in a mix of warmer neutrals and pops of pink/red. For a mostly matte palette, it actually applied quite well to bare skin, and I didn’t have issues blending out the majority of the shades. I was surprised, because a lot of the new matte eyeshadows in the palette feel much softer and smoother compared to most of Anastasia’s matte eyeshadow range that I’ve tried–they felt more like LORAC’s formula–but they still adhered exceptionally well to bare skin without sheering out or becoming patchy. The majority of the shades were pigmented and wore for seven to eight hours. As a note, it is packaged with a velvety exterior (like the original Urban Decay Naked palette), not the standard cardboard.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,ZIN,Lipstick,"a soft plum. It’s a muted, medium-dark rosy mauve with neutral-to-warm undertones and a natural finish. It had rich color payoff with a creamy, light-to-medium-weight consistency that applied well and gave lips a smoother, plumper look. The formula was hydrating over the four and a half hours this shade lasted.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,RESTINA,Lipstick,"a natural pink. It’s a light, pink-tinged beige with neutral-to-cool undertones and a soft shine. It had good color coverage that was mostly opaque–there is a smidgen of the lip color coming through to my eye. The consistency was creamy with some weight to it, but it wasn’t heavy or uncomfortable. The texture seemed to help this go on smoothly (as it doesn’t have too much slip) and not settle into lines. It lasted for four and a half hours on me. ",A
BITE BEAUTY,SHIRAZ,Lipstick,"a muted berry. It’s a medium, pinky plum with warm undertones and a very, very fine shimmer. It had semi-opaque color payoff, and it had a much thinner consistency compared to other Luminous Creme lipsticks I’ve tried. It had more slip and had a more translucent look applied. The color went on evenly, and it was comfortable to wear, but it was surprisingly thin. On me, the color lasted for four hours and was hydrating.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,Cortado/Latte,Palette,"a dual-ended lipstick, so there is a lipstick shade on each side. This duo features a warm, rosy plum and a lighter, rosy brown. The duo is sold out online, though you may be able to find it in store still. Definitely making a mental note to cave on these earlier in the season for next holiday.",A-
BURBERRY,DARK ROSEWOOD,Lipstick,"muted, medium-dark rose plum with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It was intensely pigmented–one pull from the tube was more than enough both my top and bottom lips. The lipstick felt creamy, velvety, and whipped in texture, and it spread easily across the lips without becoming patchy or uneven. This shade lasted for seven hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
BURBERRY,FAWN ROSE,Lipstick,"a soft, dusty pink with neutral-to-warm undertones and a satin finish. It had rich color payoff that applied with smooth, even color coverage. For a lighter shade, the texture was more flattering than I expected, and it lasted longer than average at five and a half hours (though not quite the eight promised!). It had a lightweight, more mousse-like consistency that wasn’t thick or heavy but not as runny as some liquid lipsticks. The formula was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,SAKE,Lipstick,"a dusty mauve. It’s a muted, medium-dark pinky mauve with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff with a soft, lightly creamy consistency that applied well without tugging. On me, this shade lasted for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,PEPPER,Lipstick,"a dusty rose. It’s a slightly muted, medium-dark rosy mauve with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had opaque color coverage with a lightweight consistency that was firmer in the tube, so it tug a little at the lips but didn’t drag with uneven color. The color wore well for five hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,RHUBARB,Lipstick,"a rich plum rose. It’s a muted, rosy mauve with subtle, warmer undertones with a soft sheen. It had rich pigmentation that applied with smooth, even color. The formula had a light creaminess to it and was a bit more emollient (and had more slip) compared to some shades in the range. This shade lasted for five hours and was very lightly hydrating.",A
NARS,AMERICAN WOMAN,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, rosy mauve with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It’s part of the permanent range, and the included shade in the set is of the same color and quality–richly pigmented, a very fluid (almost too fluid) consistency, and a flattering dry down. It lasted for five hours but wasn’t transfer-proof (I’d go as far as to say transfer-resistant–hardly any was visible on a glass, but if I blotted, I’d see more) and was non-drying.",A-
MAC,AMONG THE FIREFLIES,Lipstick,"a muted, plummy brown with a soft sheen. It had good color coverage in a single layer with a lightweight, lightly creamy texture that glided on with ease but did not feel too slippery on the lips. It wore well for four hours and was neither hydrating nor drying.",A-
MAC,BABY'S ALL RIGHT,Lipstick,"a muted, medium rosy mauve with neutral-to-cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had excellent pigmentation with a smooth, velvety texture that glided across the lips without dragging. It was a bit thicker, though, and separated at my deeper lip lines and settled slightly over time. The lipstick lasted well for four hours on me and was non-drying.",B+
MAC,BARE BLING,Lipstick,"a light peach with a white base and a cream finish. It appeared lighter when I applied it to my lips than swatched, and for as light as it was, it went on a lot more evenly than I expected. There was still room for it to be more even but little color gathered in my lipes despite the creamier consistency. This shade wore well for four hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,BEST BITE REMIX,Palette,"four mini-sized High Pigment Lip Pencils. They come in a red, metal tin (much like a mint tin), and each pencil is 0.05 oz. Full-sized pencils are $24.00 for 0.09 oz. or $266.67/oz., which makes this set worth $53.33. Sable and Winterberry seem to be exclusive to this, while Rhubarb and Pomegranate are part of the permanent range. I have reviewed a few shades previously here, and my experience with the pencils in this set are similar to ones I’ve had with full-sized, which is a good sign. All four shades were quite pigmented with creamy, glide-on textures that never dragged on the lips, but they weren’t slippery, so they didn’t slide around once applied. The wear varied from shade to shade, but they wore four hours or longer (see below). They’re comfortable to wear, as they don’t cling, and they were lightly hydrating. Bite describes the finish as “modern matte,” but they’re more satin to natural in finish–there’s a noticeable sheen.",A
NARS,DIGITAL WORLD,Palette,"includes five, travel-sized lip pencils. Each Velvet Matte Lip Pencil contains 0.06 oz., and each Satin Lip Pencil contains 0.05 oz.  It is exclusive to Sephora.  They come in a long, rectangular plastic box (feels like acrylic to me, but I’m not an expert on materials!)–it’s thick, sturdy plastic, and it feels like something you would keep, not toss away. Three shades are limited edition (and two of those were released earlier this year in the Final Cut collection), and two are part of the permanent range. The only real downside to NARS’ lip pencils is that they require sharpening, so there is waste, and they may not be as travel-friendly since they don’t just twist-up. Otherwise, the formula has good color payoff, wears well, and is comfortable to wear.",A
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,BITCH PERFECT,Lipstick,"lightly muted, light-medium coral with a hint of pink and warm undertones, and it has a lightly luminous finish–a little more of a sheen than satin.",A
CHANEL,CHERI (61),Lipstick,"a light-medium, rosy-peach with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It had mostly opaque color payoff, but there was some translucency as you could see my lip freckle peeking through. It applied evenly overall, but you may get slight “lines” if you press your lips together; thankfully, they’re not noticeable from a normal viewing distance–only up-close. It managed to wear for three hours on me.",B
CHANEL,IRRESISTIBLE (62),Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark, pink-shimmered plum with subtle, cool undertones and a pearly sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, and it covered the lips fairly evenly with color. It lasted for three and a half hours, and it was lightly hydrating during that time.",B
HOURGLASS,NO ONE KNOWS,Lipstick,"a peachy coral with warm, orange undertones and a cream finish. It had good color payoff–nearly opaque–that applied evenly for the most part. The texture was lightweight with moderate slip, and as a result, there was a bit of color that gathered in my lip lines and very subtle streaking along the edges of my lips. It wore well for four and a half hours but was lightly hydrating over time.",B+
HOURGLASS,I'VE KISSED,Lipstick,"a soft, medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had excellent pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across the lips without tugging or dragging. The lipstick was lightweight, creamy without being slippery, and easy to wear. On me, it lasted for four and a half hours and was slightly moisturizing.",A
BITE BEAUTY,AMARETTO,Lipstick,"a peachy nude. It’s a muted, light-medium peach with slight beige coloring and a satin finish. It had full opaque color coverage with a lightweight consistency that was creamy without being slippery. The color lasted for four and a half hours on me and was lightly hydrating over time.",A
BITE BEAUTY,GLACE,Lipstick,"a dusty mauve. It’s a muted, medium rose with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had rich color payoff that covered the lips evenly. This shade stayed on well for five hours and was lightly hydrating.",A
BITE BEAUTY,LECHE,Lipstick,a dusty pale pink. It’s a peachy-pink with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had full color payoff that went on fairly evenly and smoothly. This shade wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating over time.,A
URBAN DECAY,STUDDED,Lipstick,"a metallic gray-brown with a Metallized finish. It’s a muted, dark taupe-brown with subtle, warmer undertones and a metallic shimmer-sheen finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage with a lightly emollient texture that was easy to apply and comfortable to wear. It could have applied more evenly, though, and I did notice some of the color pooled into lip lines over time. This shade wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",B
URBAN DECAY,GUBBY,Lipstick,"a frosted light pink with a Metallized finish. It’s a light, pale peachy-pink with warm undertones and a metallic finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage that didn’t apply as evenly as one might like, and I did have issues with the milkier color pulling into lip lines after two hours of wear. The texture was lightly creamy with moderate slip and glided on comfortably. This shade wore well for three hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",C+
URBAN DECAY,UNICORN,Lipstick,"a pale peachy nude with a Comfort Matte finish.  It’s a light-medium pinky-peach with warm undertones and a satin sheen. It had nearly full color payoff that went on fairly evenly, but it was hard to get it to be completely even and streak-free. The texture was lightweight, creamy, and glided on without tugging on the lips. On me, the color lasted for four hours but settled into lip lines over time. It was just a little hydrating overall.",B+
URBAN DECAY,WEIRDO,Lipstick,"a pale baby pink with a Cream finish. It’s a light peachy-pink with strong,w arm undertones and a creamy, lightly glossy finish. It had good pigmentation, but it just didn’t apply evenly and tended to gather in lip lines, so there were areas that were fully covered and others that weren’t. The texture had moderate slip, and it did move around, so “lines” were created if I pressed my lips together. The color lasted for four hours and was moisturizing.",B-
URBAN DECAY,WHIP,Lipstick,"a soft pink with gold iridescent shimmer with a Sheer Shimmer finish. It’s a sheer, frosted gold with a lightly glossy sheen. These types of sheerer, mostly gold-shimmer shades tend to look alike on the lips (even when they seem lighter/darker). I don’t know why this isn’t listed as a Sheer, so it ended up rating lower than you might expect On the press release, it was listed as a Metallized shade, but it is officially a Sheer Shimmer per reader Kate and confirmed via Sephora’s website. The texture was thin with a balm-like feel, and it lasted for two hours on me.",B-
COLOUR POP,TIP TOE,Lipstick,"a medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had opaque color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips without tugging. The lipstick had a creamy consistency with enough slip to be comfortable to use and wear, but it didn’t slide around over time. This particular shade felt a touch thicker than others in the line-up, which I felt was a bit more flattering on the lips (at least to my texture). It wore well for four hours and was hydrating while worn.",A-
COLOUR POP,CAROUSEL,Lipstick,"a medium, peachy coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was nearly opaque in a single layer, while the texture was lightweight, creamy with moderate slip and was a bit thinner compared to other shades in the range. It wore well for four hours and was lightly hydrating over time, but there was a bit of product that settled into my lip lines over time.",B+
CHANEL,LOST,Lipstick,"a soft, medium peach with warm, orange undertones and a natural sheen. This particular shade seemed to apply (or at least, look) much lighter on my lips than swatched, and that might have had something to do with the medium coverage of the formula. It did not apply as well as I had hoped, as the color gathered in my lip lines and made my lips appear slightly more textured as a result. This shade wore well for three and a half hours but was comfortable to wear.",C
CHANEL,HIGHWAY,Lipstick,"a bright, peachy orange with warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly, but there were subtle–but visible–streaks along the edges a long with color that pulled into my lip lines from initial application. The consistency was thin, almost watery going on, but it “set” to a more substantial texture (but felt lightweight and comfortable to wear) after a few minutes. It wore well for four hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",C+
CHANEL,ANDRIENNE (402),Lipstick,"an apricot nude. It’s a light-medium, peach with a hint of pink and warm undertones. It had a very fine pearly sheen that gave it a more luminous finish that wasn’t too glossy. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a lightly creamy consistency that glided on well and wore comfortably for three hours on me.",B
CHANEL,ANTIONETTE (406),Lipstick,"a shimmering tawny brown. It’s a rich, copper-red with warm, rusty red tones and a fine golden shimmer. It had mostly opaque pigmentation that covered evenly and applied smoothly. The texture of the lipstick is lightly creamy with enough slip to glide on without tugging on the lips but doesn’t slide around. On me, it wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A
CHANEL,JEANNE (408),Lipstick,"a deep chocolate. It’s a dark, reddish-brown with warm undertones and a soft, glossy shine. It had semi-opaque color coverage that applied fairly evenly and didn’t feather or bleed over the four and a half hours it lasted.",B+
NARS,HUMORESQUE,Palette,"five full-sized Audacious Lipsticks held in a hefty, mirrored case with a velvet-lined interior (that has indentations where the lipsticks fit) that can be removed to just use the case in its full capacity. All five lipstick shades are part of the permanent range. Audacious Lipsticks retail for $32 each (or $160.00 for five), so this set is only “worth it” if you’re looking for the packaging, but otherwise, you might as well pick your personal five favorite shades. The quality of all five seemed exactly the same as the full-sized versions, which is quite high–soft, smooth, creamy consistencies with good pigmentation, comfortable wear and moderate wear-time. I don’t personally find it to be a very hydrating formula, but it isn’t drying either. You can see my round-up on the Audacious Lipstick formula here. I’ve swatched and re-tested the five shades as they were included in this set.",A-
MAYBELLINE,BREATHTAKING APRICOT (005),Lipgloss,"a light-medium, warm-toned pink with white sparkle. It had semi-opaque color coverage, applied mostly evenly, and lasted for four hours on me.",A-
MAYBELLINE,DASHING ORCHID (035),Lipgloss,"a medium-dark, cool-toned plum with very fine fuchsia and pink micro-shimmer. It had semi-opaque color coverage with a noticeable level of translucency, so the natural lip color will come through. It applied evenly for the most part, and this shade wore well for four hours.",B+
MAYBELLINE,HIBISCUS HAVEN (085),Lipgloss," a brightened, light-medium, blue-based pink with a cream finish. It had semi-opaque to nearly opaque color, but this was a shade that did not apply evenly. Even when it was finally into place, a mere pressing of the lips once moves the color around yet again. It lasted four and a half hours on me.",B-
MAC,FORTUNE RED,Lipgloss,"a medium red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a jelly-like finish. It had medium to semi-opaque, buildable color coverage that went on evenly and didn’t gather in my lip lines. The consistency was thinner than the average Lipglass, which I expect was partially due to the packaging have a tighter opening that made it so less product was on the doe-foot applicator. It was still moderately tacky as the Lipglass formula typically is. The gloss lasted for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A-
MAC,PEACH BLOSSOM PINK,Lipgloss,"a medium, fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly, but there was noticeable color that had welled in my lip lines. The high-shine finish made that less noticeable from a normal viewing distance, though. The consistency was slightly thin compared to most Lipglass shades I’ve tried, but it spread well and was still moderately tacky, so the wear was longer at nearly five hours. The formula was lightly hydrating on me.",B+
MAC,SILLY,Lipgloss,"a medium, bubblegum pink with subtle blue undertones and a creamy, glossy finish.",B
PAT MCGRATH,ATTITUDE,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark brown with warm, rosy undertones and a cream finish. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, creamy texture that was a bit emollient compared to the average shade in the formula. I didn’t have any issues applying it, though, and the color still adhered well to the lips for long-wear (six hours). The formula felt hydrating over time.",A
PAT MCGRATH,BEAUTY JUNKIE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was opaque in a single layer, while the texture felt velvety and just barely creamy–it felt more like a hybrid between the LuxeTrance and MatteTrance formulas to me. The color applied evenly and lasted for seven hours on me, but there was a smidgen of color that settled into my deeper lip lines over time. I found the lipstick was moisturizing while I wore it.",A
PAT MCGRATH,WRECKED,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark berry with subtle, cool undertones and a natural sheen. It had good color payoff in a single layer, which was buildable to full coverage with half of a layer more. The texture was lightweight, thin but not too thin, and just creamy enough to slide across the lips without dragging. The color adhered evenly and stayed on well for over seven hours but felt comfortable and lightly hydrating while worn.",A
CLE DE PEAU,BAL MASQUE,Highlighter,"a very pale, pink-tinged beige with fine golden shimmer-sheen. I know what you’re thinking, “But Temptalia, why would you buy a $120 body powder?” And I’d have no real answer for you other than I was really curious to see if it was good, bad, or somewhere in-between. I remain curious, as well, about what might be in it that makes it inappropriate as a cheek highlighter (the box does say to avoid direct contact with eyes, but it isn’t unusual for cheek colors/highlighters to be safe for cheeks but not eyes!). It is luminous and high-shine on the skin, whether body or cheeks, but I don’t think it veers into disco ball territory where the shimmer emphasizes the skin’s natural texture. There are noticeable sparkly bits here and there, but it is the least glittery body powder I’ve come across–not that I’ve tried more than a dozen over the years! The powder is soft, smooth, and incredibly finely-milled, while it is blendable and easily diffused for sheerer or heavier shimmer coverage. The powder has a floral scent, which I didn’t notice often when wearing it, so it didn’t seem as heavy-handed as some fragranced powders can be. The powder lasted for eight hours with minor migration when I wore it on my neck/shoulders, but I didn’t notice migration when I tried it on cheeks.",A-
URBAN DECAY,NOONER,Palette,"a bronzer, highlighter, and blush poured into a single pan (so each shade does touch!) with the bronzer taking up the most space and the highlighter taking up the least. Each shade is supposed to be “intensely pigmented” and “blend beautifully.” The highlighter was the highest performing shade out of the trio, while the blush was the least, though as long as you don’t mind less pigmented (but buildable) blush, it may still work well for you.",B+
MAC,SHRIMPTON,Lipstick,"a light-medium peach with warm undertones and a satin finish. The lipstick had opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips without tugging. I was impressed by how evenly it applied given how light the color was. The texture was lightweight, thicker (which I felt helped keep it from emphasizing my lip lines), and comfortable to wear. The color lasted for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
MAC,ICON,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark bronze with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had medium coverage that was buildable to semi-opaque pigmentation with two to three layers. The lipstick was smooth, lightly creamy with moderate slip and a thin consistency that glided across my lips without tugging. It wore well for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
MAC,SPANISH FLY,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, plummy brown with warm undertones and blue-to-teal shifting pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a lightweight, thin, lightly emollient texture that glided across my lips easily and was comfortable to wear. The color went on evenly and stayed on well for four and a half hours. My lips didn’t feel dry after wearing this shade.",B+
MAC,BRONX,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark beige with warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. The texture was denser and firmer in the tube, though it didn’t seem to drag on my lips, but it did apply a thinner layer of product that was more prone to emphasizing my lip texture. It wore well for four and a half hours but was somewhat drying over time.",B
COLOUR POP,BIJOU,Lipstick,"a medium-dark purple with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had great pigmentation that covered the lips evenly and easily as the consistency wasn’t too thick or too thin and spread across the lips nicely. I did notice that there was a bit of color that settled into my deeper lip line, but it wasn’t noticeable from a normal viewing distance. This shade lasted for eight hours and was just a touch drying after six hours of wear.",A
COLOUR POP,EMBELLISH,Lipstick,"a deep brown with neutrla undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which was in part the result of having a thinner, more watery consistency that was prone to streaking. I think it could have sustained a second layer to intensify and even out the color, as it didn’t dry down to the point where it was thick or “cracked.” The color lasted for six hours, was drying, and wore down more heavily around the center of the mouth after four hours of wear.",C+
COLOUR POP,KNOTTY,Lipstick,"a deep peach with warm undertones and a flat, matte finish. It was incredibly rich in pigment, but the drydown was terrible; it was thin to the point where it looked “cracked” when I smiled, emphasized every line on my lips, and just looked like my lips lacked moisture. I’m not sure why some of ColourPop’s Ultra Mattes dry down like this–almost chalk-like, clingy, and ver dry–while others have a smooth, matte finish that while drying after hours of wear doesn’t look shriveled from the get-go. It lasted for five hours but had flaked away unevenly from the center of the mouth after two and a a half hours.",D+
COLOUR POP,WILD NOTHING,Lipstick,"a deep plum with warm undertones and a mostly matte finish. I feel like the holiday shades are proof positive of just how wildly inconsistent this formula is, because this shade took over an hour to fully dry down, whereas the others were dry in a minute or so. The texture of this shade was also thicker, smoother, which resulted in much more pigmentation in less product (one stroke over-applied–I’d use a lip brush with this shade going forward).",A-
NATASHA DENONA,BURNT TERRACOTTA/GREEN (1),Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium orange-copper base with gold-to-green shifting shimmer. It had buildable color payoff rom semi-sheer to fully opaque (two to three layers with a brush or one layer with a fingertip). The texture was lightly creamy and felt smoother and was easier to use on the lid (with a brush or with fingertips) than the other two shades released in the same formula. The eyeshadow applied well to bare skin and stayed on for nine hours without fallout.",A
NATASHA DENONA,BROWN MAUVE/PURPLE (2),Eyeshadow,"a medium, copper with warm, brown undertones and sparkle that shifted from pink to violet. The texture was lightly creamy, but it felt more like a densely-packed powder than a cream eyeshadow to me (I think if it was just a bit creamier, it would be easier to work with and more versatile). It had semi-sheer, buildable pigmentation (up to opaque if used with fingertips) that blended out fairly well and lasted for nine hours on me with minimal fallout.",B+
NATASHA DENONA,LAVENDER/GOLD AND SILVER (3),Eyeshadow,"a soft, periwinkle blue with a grayish cast and glitter that shifted from silver to gold. It had sheer to semi-sheer coverage, and the consistency felt drier and chunkier, which made it harder to apply evenly. I had some issues with the product going on and flaking away as I tried to blend it onto the skin. Overall, I felt like this could only be applied with fingertips, and due to the larger sparkles, there was little precision. It wore well for eight and a half hours with slight fallout over time.",D+
MAKEUP GEEK,HAVOC,Eyeshadow,"a warm red-brown base with teal reflects. It’s a dark, coppery brown with green-teal shimmer and a frosted finish. It had good pigmentation with a soft, smooth, and blendable texture that was on the denser side compared to most Makeup Geek eyeshadows (not quite as dense as their Foiled range). The green-teal shift is subtle, and a lot of the shimmer seems to get eaten up by the warmer base. This is one of the more dupable duochrome shades out there, as a lot of brands have it (not a bad thing to have more options, but you may have something like it already). The color wore well for eight hours.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,I'M PEACHLESS,Eyeshadow,"a buff base with peachy-pink reflects. It’s a light-medium, pinky-peach with soft, gold sparkle and shimmer that shifts from a light white-beige to a warmer peach. It had fairly good pigmentation with a lightly crumbly, though blendable, texture. It lasted for seven and a half hours on me.",B
MAKEUP GEEK,RITZY,Eyeshadow,"a warm red-brown base with green and gold reflects. It’s a reddish-brown base with lighter green-gold shimmer–their description is very accurate on this one. The finish is more of a frosted sheen with a subtle duochrome (more nuanced but it goes from more or less reflective than really shifting). The texture was dense, smooth, and blendable with good pigmentation. The color wore for eight hours on me.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,STEAMPUNK,Eyeshadow,"a black base with rich copper reflects. It’s a deep brown with subtle, warm undertones and a pearly sheen. I can see the black base peeking through, but it doesn’t shift–no matter how I angled my arm, I really couldn’t detect the color really changing. It’s an interesting shade, but I wouldn’t call it a duochrome. It had great color payoff with a smooth, buttery texture that applied well. It wore well for seven and a half hours before creasing.",A-
MAKEUP GEEK,VOLTAGE,Eyeshadow,"a vanilla base with champagne-yellow reflects. It’s a yellowed, white gold with a metallic sheen that shifts from light white to warmer, pale gold. It had good pigmentation with a soft, blendable texture that wasn’t too dense or too soft. It applied well with even, smooth coverage and wore well for seven and a half hours before creasing.",B+
MAKEUP GEEK,KARMA,Eyeshadow,"a golden base with yellow-green reflects. It’s a bright, golden yellow with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. I don’t get a real green shift; it goes from brighter yellow to more of a yellowed orange with less of a reflective sheen. The texture was soft, blendable, but a little crumbly, and it creased after seven and a half hours of wear.",B+
SEPHORA,FACETS OF MARSALA,Palette,"a set of 24 eyeshadows to celebrate the color of the year: Marsala. Last year’s palette was larger in size and in amount ($48.00 for 1.53 oz.) with 24 eyeshadows and one blush. This year, there are still 24 eyeshadows (but no blush), and each eyeshadow is 0.017 oz. (compared to 0.059 oz. each). I liked the palette, and it was easier to use without a primer than many other palettes I’ve tried over the past few months–even the mattes–which is always a happy find, but a lot of the satin/matte shades seemed prone to fading. I think that it does get repetitive, there’s an overabundance of warmer tones, and in general, the composition could use improvement (greater diversity in tone, color selection, and for such a large palette, it could use a couple of lighter shades that could work as brow bone highlighters or transitioning shades). This palette actually seems like it will suit deeper skin tones more readily (which is often not the case), so that is a plus–I still think some cooler plums, a richer copper (rather than two gold-ish hues), and a couple of apricot/peach shades would have helped make this palette more versatile. The texture of the eyeshadows are slightly drier and more powdery–almost like there’s a bit too much filler, though color payoff is decent to good with a couple of exceptions.",B
URBAN DECAY,CHASE,Eyeshadow,a medium bronze with a subtle red undertone and a glitzy golden shimmer-sheen.,A
URBAN DECAY,LAST CALL,Eyeshadow,a plummy burgundy with a hint of pink sheen.,B+
URBAN DECAY,LOADED,Eyeshadow,"a blackened green-teal. It goes on very, very dark–you will lose some of the strength of the overall green/teal if you blend it out, but it doesn’t look full-on black.",A
URBAN DECAY,MUSHROOM,Eyeshadow,a gray-brown–it’s a very intense taupe.,A-
URBAN DECAY,ROCKSTAR,Eyeshadow,"a dark, smoky purple with subtle red undertones.",A
URBAN DECAY,SHATTERED,Eyeshadow,a silvered blue with a green-gold duochrome.,B+
MAC,MOODYBLUE,Palette,"a blue-hued set of shades that ranges from light gray to navy blue. This was my least favorite of the three palettes, as it performed the worst out of the bunch. Three of the shades are part of the permanent range, while three are limited edition. Too many shades from this set had drier, thinner, and were more difficult to blend out on the skin to make it a must-have.",C
MAKE UP FOR EVER,I902 QUARTZ,Eyeshadow,"a light, pastel pink with a frosted sheen and cool undertones. It had good color payoff with a soft, blendable consistency that wore well for eight and a half hours before fading.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,I904 COTTON CANDY,Eyeshadow,"a brightened, light-medium cotton candy pink with cool, blue undertones and a sprinkling of iridescent white and violet shimmer that gives it a more pearly sheen. It had nice pigmentation with a soft, smooth consistency that applies really evenly to the lid. The color lasted for eight and a half hours before fading slightly.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,I916 FROSTED MAUVE,Eyeshadow," pale lavender with cool undertones and icy white shimmer. It had a soft frosted finish. The texture was soft but a little drier in the pan, even though it doesn’t feel dry or powdery, but it was a little harder to dislodge the product from the pan. It had semi-opaque coverage and lasted for eight hours me.",B
MAKE UP FOR EVER,S314 NILE GREEN,Eyeshadow,"a light-medium, mint green with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had good color payoff, but it was a little more challenging to apply as opaque on the lid as it appeared in the swatch. I had the best results when applying it with a flat, synthetic brush. It started to crease after eight and a half hours of wear.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,S208 BABY BLUE,Eyeshadow,"light-medium, brightened sky blue with a soft, pearly shimmer. It had good pigmentation, but like S314, it was a challenge to apply and blend–it had an uneven, almost dry look on the skin that seemed to emphasize the skin’s natural texture. While it lasted for eight hours before fading, it never looked good.",B
MAKE UP FOR EVER,S404 STRAW YELLOW,Eyeshadow,"softened, light-medium yellow with warm undertones and a satiny finish. It had nice color coverage with a soft, blendable texture that wore well for nine hours.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,ME338 ACIDIC GREEN,Eyeshadow,"a bold, brightened chartreuse green with a metallic finish. It had excellent pigmentation with a soft, buttery consistency that was dense but blendable. This shade wore well for nine and a half hours before creasing slightly.",A+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,S312 MINT GREEN,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium green with cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff with a soft, lightly creamy consistency that adhered well to the skin and showed signs of fading after eight and a half hours of wear.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,S226 ABYSSAL BLUE,Eyeshadow,"a muted, murky dark blue with subtle, cooler undertones and a satin finish. The texture was firmer and resulted in less intense color payoff than most of the Artist Shadow range, which also made it harder to blend on the skin. It lasted for nine hours before fading.",B-
VISEART,DARK MATTE (04),Palette,"a mix of darker, more satin to matte shades that range from brown to blue to plum. There were a few eyeshadows that were just average, while there were a few that were exceptionally lovely to work with. The eyeshadows that I had trouble with were workable, even on bare skin, and typically the less pigmented shades were buildable in practice. I was still a little disappointed to see issues in the palette, though, at this price point. The palette can be used to create looks using just the contents, but it does work better when paired with Viseart’s other palettes to bring in more light and mid-tone shades (which is how the palette system is designed to be used).",A-
NARS,AIGLE NOIR,Eyeshadow,a black infused with gold shimmer. It’s a blackened brown with warm undertones and lighter gold shimmer that almost looks like a dirty taupe to me. The finish is just shy of frost and appears more as a pearly sheen. It had decent coverage in a single stroke but was buildable to full opacity in two layers. The color looked patchy when blended and was difficult to keep looking intense/opaque. It creased after six hours of wear.,D+
NARS,FILBUSTE,Eyeshadow,"a black. It’s an inky black with neutral undertones and a satin finish. It had rich color payoff in a single stroke as the consistency was very creamy with some slip, which seemed to impact the wear, as it had bled and migrated as an eyeliner after five hours and creased after four.",C-
NARS,GLENAN,Eyeshadow,"a navy. It’s a dark, navy blue with fine blue pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in one stroke, which was slightly buildable but was never opaque for me. It had a tendency to skip and feather in a way when applied, and it was a shade that easily became patchy when blended. It started to crease after five and a half hours of wear.",D+
NARS,GODDESS,Eyeshadow,"a pink champagne. It’s a pinky-peach with lighter gold and pink shimmer. It is a more frosted shade with semi-opaque pigmentation in one stroke that tended to thicken and apply unevenly when I tried to build it up, so it seemed best used in a single layer. This shade lasted for six hours before creasing.",C
NARS,HOLLYWOODLAND,Eyeshadow,"a pale gold. It’s a brightened, light-medium yellow gold with a frosted sheen. It had mostly opaque coverage in one stroke, and you could layer and blend without too much work. It tended to keep its color without lifting or turning patchy, unlike the other shades in the formula. The color started to crease after six and a half hours for me, so it didn’t wear that well.",B-
NARS,OAXACA,Eyeshadow,"a quartz. It’s a muted, medium-dark taupe brown with warm, rosy undertones and a lighter bronze shimmer. It had sheer coverage in one stroke, and it was noticeably drier than the other shades. I was able to build up the color with three layers, but it was very difficult to blend out the edges. The color lasted for six hours before creasing on me.",F
NARS,REYKJAVIK,Eyeshadow,"a grey. It’s a deepened gray with a cool, bluish tint and satin finish. It had semi-opaque coverage in a single pass, and it was buildable to opaque color with ease, as it was rather creamy. It wasn’t as quick to crease as Filbuste, but it only lasted for five and a half hours. It was more blendable along the edges but still had a tendency to look uneven.",C+
NARS,SUKHOTHAI,Eyeshadow,"a shimmering peacock.” It’s a warm, plummy purple base with blackened teal shimmer. It’s a very interesting shade to see in a cream-based formula, but this was so patchy and uneven applied. I really wish this shade performed better, because it’s really quite interesting and somewhat complex, even on the actual eye (most eyeshadows lose their nuances once applied). I saw creasing after five and a half hours of wear.",F
THEBALM,BALMSAI,Palette,"eighteen eyeshadows that range from beige to blue to black with a variety of finishes. The palette gives off a more muted vibe–none of the colors are really bold or bright, they tend to have a softer, more muted quality to them. Some shades are good color payoff while others were just so-so, but many of them were powdery and a little dry (not stiff, just a drier, powdery consistency). I noticed many were prone to fading, and I felt like it was difficult to apply these without a primer underneath, as the powdery, drier texture made the product less inclined to stick to bare skin. This primer absolutely needs a primer to be workable in order to combat the under-pigmented eyeshadows along with the more powdery textures that they have.",B-
LORAC,MEGA PRO 2,Palette,"sixteen matte eyeshadows and sixteen more shimmery shades (varies from satin to metallic). The quality is comparable to LORAC’s eyeshadow formula in the past Pro palettes: very silky and soft but moderately powdery, so some shades are faster to fade, have a lot of fall out, or sheer out when applied to the skin. I like their shimmers more than their mattes, because I test over bare skin, and the mattes tend to need a primer to perform well. The palette gets pretty messy, as there is a ton of excess kick-up with almost all of the shades, so use the most delicate of motions to get color out of a pan.",B
URBAN DECAY,DISTORTION,Palette,"five “duotone shadows” designed to “transform” the remaining 10 (regular) eyeshadows housed in a large, plastic palette with a more chromatic exterior. Each eyeshadow was 0.06 oz., so the palette definitely has plenty of product for the money. I had higher expectations–both based on the concept but also based on the brand’s Heavy Metals palette, which was fabulous–but this just didn’t meet them. It left me a little confused and wanting more.",C+
MAC,ANTONIO LOPEZ 6 EYES/TEAL,Palette,"a new and limited edition palette that launches in-stores on September 12th. It contains six eyeshadows. Like a lot of MAC’s limited edition palettes, it’s a mixed bag. Some shades performed decent to well, others were more disappointing. These perform best over a primer, and I wouldn’t recommend wearing them without one for two reasons: 1) they don’t last well  (six hours), and 2) Colourful Life is prone to staining without a primer.  Even though four of the six shades are decent, one is an abysmal failure and the other is only slightly less worse",C+
NATASHA DENONA,OXIDE (63M),Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark copper brown with warm, red undertones and a frosted sheen. It was intensely pigmented with a creamy, buttery, and smooth texture. This was easily one of the best shades I tried from the brand. It wore for seven and a half hours before creasing.",A
NATASHA DENONA,GOLDEN ROSE (60M),Eyeshadow,"a medium, rosy pink with warm undertones and a strong, metallic gold sheen. It had good pigmentation with a blendable texture that was a little soft and prone to fall out during application, but it did apply well to bare skin. On me, I noticed slight creasing after seven hours of wear. Makeup Geek Wildfire (P, $12.00) is less shimmery (95% similar).",B
NATASHA DENONA,GOLDEN BEIGE (52M),Eyeshadow,"a bright, gold-shimmered peach with a metallic sheen. The texture was very soft, but a little loose in the pan, so it is an eyeshadow that applies best by patting and packing it on than sweeping it on. It had good pigmentation and blended out easily. The color started to crease after six and a half hours of wear.",B
NATASHA DENONA,PETROLEUM BLUE (92M),Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark blue with cool undertones and a frosted sheen. It had good color payoff with a soft, smooth, blendable texture that wasn’t too loose or too soft in the pan. It applied well to bare skin and showed signs of creasing after seven and a half hours of wear. Urban Decay Unhinged (LE, $19.00) is darker, warmer (95% similar).",B+
NATASHA DENONA,DEEP PACIFIC (03V),Eyeshadow,"a blackened, bluish-teal with a soft, pearly shimmer-sheen finish. It had decent color payoff, but it was one of the drier, looser, and less pigmented shimmery shades I’ve come across in the brand’s range. It builds up fairly well, and it blends out decently — it just has a slightly rougher edge to it. On me, it wore for seven and a half hours.",B-
URBAN DECAY,ABC GUM,Eyeshadow,"a pale peach matte. It’s a warm-toned peach with a matte finish. The texture is soft, finely-milled, albeit a bit powdery, but it blends really well and sits nicely on the skin (doesn’t look powdery).",A
URBAN DECAY,ASPHYXIA,Eyeshadow,"a hyacinth shimmer with blue shift. It’s a light-medium, pink-lavender with an iridescent, blue sheen. The texture was soft, slightly powdery, and applies best with a moderately firm brush. The color payoff was so-so, but it is buildable to mostly opaque color payoff; applied over a base, and true-to-pan opacity is possible.",B-
URBAN DECAY,HAIGHT,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark blue with a hint of green (but it’s not enough to make it teal) and has a frosted finish. The color payoff is lovely and rich, while the texture is soft, smooth, and buttery. It’s easy to use and blend out on the lid.",A
COLOUR POP,TOP NOTCH,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. The new Pressed Powder Shadow formula is supposed to be “highly pigmented” with an “ultra-velvety and silky” texture that is “long-wearing” and “adheres easily to the eyes.” It had good pigmentation, which was buildable to full coverage with a second layer. The consistency was soft, lightly dusty but not too messy or fallout-prone during application, and blendable in practice. This shade wore well for seven and a half hours on me before fading.",B+
COLOUR POP,CLOUD NINE,Eyeshadow,"a dark brown with subtle, warm red undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly and smoothly with just a little extra effort to blend out the edges to avoid patchiness. The texture was smooth, a touch dusty, and finely-milled in the pan. This shade started fade on me after seven and a half hours of wear.",B+
COLOUR POP,SAVE IT FOR LATER,Eyeshadow,"a medium copper with strong, warm orange undertones and a frosted sheen. It had nice pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly to bare skin. The eyeshadow felt smooth, almost cream-like, and blended out well on the skin. It wore for just over seven and a half hours on me.",A-
COLOUR POP,LOST AND FOUND,Eyeshadow,"a bright, medium blue with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had medium coverage, which I did not find built up well, so it always had a faded, uneven, and patchy look–even over a primer. The texture was quite dusty, which made it prone to sheering out as well. It lasted for six and a half hours on me before fading.",C-
COLOUR POP,PIECE OF CAKE,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark, purplish blue with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a soft, lightly dusty texture that made it harder to apply and build up to get better coverage and true-to-pan intensity. This shade started to fade after six and a half hours on me.",C
COLOUR POP,BACKSEAT,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark blue with cool undertones and a frosted finish. It was a “warmer” blue, so it didn’t run quite as rich or as deep as a more cobalt-hued blue would. The consistency was a little firmer in the pan, though it still yielded good pigmentation and was fairly easy to apply and blend out on the lid. It wore well for seven and a half hours on me before fading.",B
MAC,GET IT GLOWIN',Palette,"a new, limited edition gold and copper-hued highlighting trio that launches on February 15th. All three shades had semi-opaque to opaque pigmentation with soft, blendable textures that were easy to use. Two of the shades were very similar, especially applied, and I would have liked to have seen more differentiation since they’re within the same palette.",A-
COLOUR POP,NICOLE GUERRIERO,Palette,"six highlighters that are “metallic” and have “intense luminosity.” The formula is supposed to be “ultra-fine” and “won’t leave behind shimmer particles.” From experience, the formula didn’t feel quite as smooth, creamy, or as finely-milled as some of the original Glow Kits but felt more like the Sweets Glow Kit to me (not as glittery as the Ultimate Glow Kit)–smooth, denser but still blendable on the skin. There were some sparkles that blended beyond the area I had actually applied the color. With the exception of Forever Lit, the palette was very warm-toned, but I felt like Kitty Kat and Daydream looked very similar on along with Glo Getter and 143 (these two I think will be more similar across more skin tones, whereas the stronger orange tone in Daydream may be more or less apparent on some skin tones/undertones). If you love a strong, metallic, and sparkling highlighter, you may enjoy this kit, but if you like your highlighters more buildable, subtle, or cooler, this one likely won’t be the one for you. They can be worn on the eyes (per the brand) as well.",B+
TOO FACED,THE POWER OF MAKEUP,Palette,"a slew of products for the eyes and cheeks. It’s a decent palette, but the eyeshadows have room for improvement, as they are not consistent. They also need to be applied over a primer in order to have decent or better pigmentation, to last at least eight hours, and for blending as some of the shades are drier and tended to sheer out when applied. Without primer, they have a more faded appearance and most of the shades lasted six to seven hours. I think the brand should have included their Glitter Insurance, instead of their standard Eyeshadow Primer (but worth reiterating is that Too Faced touts their eyeshadows as highly pigmented and long-wearing as a formula), because three of the eyeshadows, plus the glitter, absolutely need an adhesive base or else it is a one-way ticket to Fallout City.

As a lot of readers have noted in the initial launch post, the palette looks a lot like every other holiday palette Too Faced has released. I struggled a bit myself trying to pair the shades together, as it didn’t feel as cohesive as you might have expected, and the drier, more crumbly textures of the metallic shades didn’t blend well with the thinner matte shades. The two blushes and bronzers are permanent shades, though Justify My Love is a much darker, brighter, and cooler-toned shade in the palette than my single (by a lot). The highlighter, Champagne Truffle, is actually an eyeshadow from another palette, so you might have that already in your stash.
",B-
BURBERRY,CORAL PINK,Blush,"a subtly warmed-up dark pink with a hint of coral. It has a soft, satiny finish with a barely-there sheen. Worth noting:  I couldn’t see much of a difference between Coral Pink and Hydrangea Pink (the other shade released in the collection) once applied and blended out. I bought both to review, but I don’t think both are necessary if you intend to wear them sheered out–I do think the nuances will be better seen on cooler skin tones, though. Again, one of Burberry’s aims for their spring/summer collection was to introduce “radiant colour” into their range. Coral Pink is incredibly pigmented–if you are a fan of NARS’ richness in their blush range, you’ll appreciate the intensity found in the newest addition to Burberry’s blush range. I highly recommend using a light hand or a feathery brush for application.  The texture of the powder is soft as silk, finely-milled, and applies smoothly and evenly (Burberry’s blushes are some of the softest, most velvety powders I’ve come across).  It’s blendable once applied, and Coral Pink wore eight hours well but had some signs of fading after nine hours.
",A
NARS,REALM OF THE SENSES,Palette,"three shades that can be used individually or swirled together. The texture is soft and very finely-milled–almost to the point where it can turn powdery. I recommend using your softest brush, as any brush with stiffer bristles will turn the surface quite powdery. This is especially key if you only want to use the shades individually. The beige-ish shade was the only one that had slightly sheer color payoff, while the other two shades (and then all three swirled together) had good color coverage. One shade in this palette is supposed to be a sheerer, highlighting shade, so that would account for the sheerness in the lighter beige shade here. I’ve been wearing them swirled together for six hours now, and the color is still going strong with no signs of fading. (I will update this post when I’ve wrapped up for the night!) Though there was powderiness in the pan/texture, it didn’t show up on the cheeks; the blushes were easy to blend and sat quite well on the skin without emphasizing pores.

The formula is supposed to be new, and I felt that it was after touching and playing with it. The texture is definitely denser, softer–almost creamier in a way–than NARS traditional powder blushes are. They also seemed more blendable (generally).",B+
TARTE,PIN UP GIRL,Palette,"five shades of blush ranging from brown to peach to plum. Each blush is 0.158 oz. and a full-sized blush is 0.20 oz. for $26. The palette contains $102.70 worth of blush, and more subjectively, for less than the price of two full-sized blushes, you’ll get to try five shades. I liked that there was a variety of finishes, and a decent spectrum of shades from beige to plum to coral. Tarte’s blushes don’t wear as long as twelve hours on me, which is a claim that is repeated over and over again for the formula. The texture of a few of these leaned powdery, and it seemed like the wear time was less than I’ve had with other Tarte shades as a result. If I set aside the 12-hour wear time claim, then the rating would bump up to B+.",B
CLINIQUE,PEACH POP (02),Blush,"a pink-coral with a satin finish and warm undertones. This is definitely one of my new favorite powder blush formulas!  Peach Pop was just as impressive as Ginger Pop.  The texture is soft and blendable, but the smoothness of the color is extraordinary.  It smooths and skims across the skin as if it were a cream blush, but it’s definitely a powder.  If you want a sheer wash of color, it’s easily achieved by using a light tap of the brush into the pan, but it has good, true-to-pan color payoff that can be as intense or as soft as desired, as it blends out so effortlessly.  The finish is lightly luminous, doesn’t emphasize pores, and looks like skin–never powdery.  Peach Pop wore well for eight hours, and then it started to fade.

I’ve spotted them online at Nordstrom as well as Sephora.
",A
EDWARD BESS,SECRET AFFAIR,Blush,"a soft peach. It’s a warm-toned, pink-tinged coral with a gold shimmer. Secret Affair has good color payoff that is buildable and blendable, so you can adjust the intensity depending on your preference and what suits a particular eye/lip combination. The texture is soft, very finely-milled, and smooth. It has a light golden shimmer that buffs into a very luminous sheen the more you blend it into the skin. It did not emphasize pores or the skin’s natural texture. It lasted eight hours well on me and had some minor, but noticeable, fading after nine hours of wear.",A
AVEDA,HIBISCUS,Blush,"a nude highlighter to soft coral to bright coral. Together, the blush swirls to create a subtly pink-tinted coral with a soft, beige-champagne shimmer-sheen finish and warm undertones. This blush is easiest to use altogether or concentrating on two of the three shades, because each strip of color just isn’t wide enough to accommodate most blush brushes. It is supposed to ve scented with lavender, though I couldn’t really smell it in the pan or on. All three individual shades were very, very pigmented, so when applied together, the result is just as rich in color payoff, but the texture is very soft and smooth. It can be sheered out to a lighter color or built up for something more intense. It has a delicate satin finish, so there’s just barely enough shimmer to give cheeks a natural glow but nothing frosted or metallic, which means pores are not emphasized either. Hibiscus lasted eight and a half hours on me, and I saw signs of fading after nine hours of wear.",A
LAURA GELLER,GUAVA,Blush,"a peachy pink. It’s a brightened, medium-dark pink-coral with a subtle, golden sheen. The formula is described as having vivid and translucent, vibrant color with a flirty, natural-looking flush that goes on “like a powder but feels like a cream.” They have a very similar texture as the Baked Gelato Swirl Illuminators I reviewed earlier this year, which I totally fell in love with. The texture has a smooth, denser feel to it that has good color payoff that’s incredibly easy to blend out on the skin. The pigmentation varies from shade to shade, but they are generally quite pigmented. Guava was intensely pigmented with a soft, blendable consistency that was dense and almost cream-like but applied and blended exactly as a powder blush would. I felt like it almost melted into the skin and gave a more stained-like appearance, but it was very even (and stains can be tricky to work with for that reason, at least for me!). What’s nice about the formula is you can use less and blend out for a tint of color or apply normally and get a bold cheek look. The blush has a luminous sheen that gives it a dewy look without emphasizing pores. It wore well for almost nine hours on me before fading slightly.",A
MAC,SUBTLE BREEZE,Blush," a blue-pink. It’s a cool-toned, blue-based pink with a subtle pink glow. The texture is soft like silk without being powdery, so it’s easy to apply, extremely blendable, and the finish is incredibly natural and glowy. It’s not high-shine or lots of sheen and shimmer. I tested out Subtle Breeze from this collection for wear, and it lasted for around six hours before it started to look noticeably faded on my normal-to-dry skin. I’ve never had good luck with getting MAC’s mineralize products to wear all day on me, unfortunately.",A-
THEBALM,HOUNDSTOOTH,Blush,"a mauve. It’s a medium-dark pink-plum with a satin finish. For a plum, it’s quite pink and lighter than the typical plum blush. The texture was soft, finely-milled, and applied very smoothly and evenly. It was easy to blend out the product, and it didn’t stick as soon as it hit the skin, so you could diffuse and soften the edges. Houndstooth had true-to-pan color and can be applied as intensely as seen in the pan or applied with a lighter hand for softer color, but it is quite pigmented. If you are fairer or prefer a subtler look, apply less than you think you need and go from there. When I wore this shade, it lasted well for eight and a half hours, and after ten hours, it looked patchy in a few places but still held up well overall.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,WICKED,Blush,"a bright, medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It is warmer and less shimmery compared to the prior formulation (see comparison here). The consistency was soft, silky, and smooth without being too powdery or too firm in the pan, though it was thinner and more powder-like to the touch than the original formula. It had mostly opaque pigmentation (less buildable as it was just pigmented) that applied well to bare skin and blended out without a lot of work. This shade wore for ten hours on me.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,#310 HD BLUSH,Blush,"a rosewood. It’s a medium, muted rosy pink with a soft, satiny sheen. It is slightly warm-toned, but it doesn’t turn coral or look reddish. I continue to be impressed by the new HD Blush formula, and I’m just so pleased that the shades have performed consistently well. It’s always frustrating when a formula is inconsistent, as you never know whether a new shade will be a hit or miss, but with this range, every shade has been quite good. #310 is no exception! It had excellent, rich color payoff that can be as bold or as subtle as you’d like. The formula itself is lightly creamy but sets and dries down to a powder-like texture after twenty to thirty seconds, but what’s nice is that the powder-like texture is blendable like you’d expect a powder blush to be. It’s just so easy to apply, blend, and then it wears well–a solid nine hours with this particular shade.",A+
DIOR,MY LADY (003),Blush,"a light-medium, pink-coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. This shade is definitely darker and warmer compared to My Lady (002), but there’s a subdued quality to it that keeps it from looking bright. If coral blushes tend to look too warm on your complexion, you might like the way the pink dominates in this shade. The texture is finely-milled and soft to the touch, easy to blend, but it was also a little powdery (not quite as powdery as the other shade, though). It had fairly good pigmentation, and the color wore well for eight hours on me when I tested it. This blush is listed as a Saks’ exclusive, and it sold out within a day or two of being available online, so you’d have to find it at a Saks’ store locally or have it shipped to you. When I looked up the nearest local store to me, the locator showed San Francisco’s location (call 866-873-0972). Saks also says, “This item may be available in the Dior boutique within a Saks store … Please call 1.877.551.7257 for assistance.",B
NARS,BLAME IT ON NARS,Palette,"a highlighter, bronzer, and two blushes, plus a traval-sized ITA brush. I have reviewed most of these shades before, so the list of similar shades is pretty up-to-date, so rather than pull a new link, I’ve included the current lists as they stand. I did test each of these versions for wear, pigmentation, application, and so forth. I think the packaging is really cool, but I wish the compact didn’t feel so bulky. I really like some of NARS’ blushes, but there are a fair amount that have been misses for me. This palette is a bit of a mixed bag, and I find there is too much variance from release to release. It may seem expensive initially, but each powder is 0.14 oz., while a full-sized highlighter/blush from NARS is 0.16 oz. and costs $30. The bronzer is larger at 0.28 oz. and retails for $39. You’re getting 0.42 oz. of blush, which is a value of $78.75. You’re getting 0.14 oz. of bronzer, which is a value of $19.50. The kit has $98.25 worth of powder products and then whatever value the ITA would bring in (full-size retails for $55, which I don’t have, so I can’t comment on the quality between the two, but I do not like the travel version at all, as it is very scratchy, rough, poorly cut, and sheds).",B-
SURRATT BEAUTY,LA VIE EN ROSE,Blush,"a soft rose. It’s a medium, pink-plum with warm undertones and a satin finish. This is the kind of shade that is easy to wear on light to medium skin tones but may get lost on deeper complexions. It isn’t too warm or reddish, and it has a subdued quality to it, so it is easily worn as a sheer layer of color or applied with more true-to-pan color. It had a soft, silky texture that felt almost like a cream blush, though it was definitely a powder product. La Vie En Rose seemed less pigmented than other shades I’ve tested in the Surratt range, though it had decent, buildable color coverage. It has a satin-matte finish that gets more luminous as it is buffed and worked into the skin, but it never looks shimmery or frosted, so it doesn’t emphasize pores or skin imperfections. The color wore well for eight and a half hours before it started to fade along the edges.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,CASHEW,Blush,"a muted, medium-dark rosy plum with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had semi-opaque, buildable pigmentation that could be sheered out. The big thing is how one applies it; swiping directly from the stick yielded more opaque coverage whereas tapping or patting it onto the skin had sheerer coverage (or if one used a brush or fingertips). The texture was denser, a bit thicker, and lightly creamy with an almost powder-like feel to it as it touched the skin. It lasted for eight and a half hours as a blush, four hours as a lip product, and minutes on the eyes (creased very quickly!).",B
KIKO,105 DARK ROSE,Blush,"a muted, medium mauve with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had good color payoff with a soft, blendable texture that was easy to work with and just the tiniest bit powdery in the pan (but it didn’t look powdery applied to my cheeks). The color lasted for seven and a half hours on me.",B
LORAC,CINEMATIC,Blush,"a muted, medium-dark rosy brown with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. The Color Source Buildable Blush formula is supposed to offer–you guessed it–buildable color coverage with a “silky-smooth” consistency available in matte and satin finishes. The texture was thin without being dry or dusty, while the powder was soft and finely-milled in feel. When applied, the color diffused easily along the edges without sheering out too readily. It had medium, buildable coverage, which seemed like a good compromise to making it easier and more forgiving to use while still making it more versatile on more skin tones (though the desaturated quality of color means it is definitely not a universal shade but few, if any, truly are!). I think this might be a possible contouring shade on some skin tones. This shade wore well for seven and a half hours before fading visibly.",A-
LAURA MERCIER,SENSUAL REFLECTIONS,Blush,"a light-medium, plummy brown with a soft sheen and neutral-to-warm undertones. Launching soon with Laura Mercier’s fall collection, this limited edition Cheek Melange is supposed to “add natural, glowing colour to cheeks … It provides natural radiance to complexion and is designed to complement all skin tones.” If you are light-medium or fairer, you may get slight color out of this, but on my medium complexion, I applied four layers–packed on–and could barely distinguish the color on me. It does, however, add a soft, luminous sheen to the skin without brightening. The powder is somewhat stiff, which contributes to needing to layer it on, though once dislodged from the pan, goes on smoothly and doesn’t look powdery. It seems to add “natural radiance” regardless of skin tone, but it doesn’t add “glowing color” to all skin tones. It doesn’t have any white base to it, so it can be applied to deeper skin tones without looking chalky, but it will be very subtle and produce mostly a soft sheen. The color/sheen lasts for almost eight hours on my skin. There are better, more finely-milled, higher performing highlighters at the $40+ price point, so this left me unimpressed. It’s too bad, because the shade itself is more unusual, so something with more color payoff and a softer texture would have been interesting.",C-
GIORGIO ARMANI,SCARABEO,Palette,"a new and limited edition palette for fall. Overall, I found the pigmentation of this palette to vary from decent to good, but the texture was on the dry side (except for the blush, which had a very lovely consistency) and somewhat powdery. The colors didn’t blend as easily on the lid as other Giorgio Armani eyeshadows have for me (many of them blend effortlessly). If you have drier eyelids, I would definitely stay away from this palette. When I wore the three eyeshadows, they looked noticeably faded after seven hours, and they had almost disappeared by ten hours (no primer); with a primer, they lasted slightly longer until eight and a half hours before starting to fade. The blush lasted well for eight hours and showed slight signs of fading after nine hours. It’s not a terrible palette–it’s decent, but at $88, it should be much better than that.",B-
GIORGIO ARMANI,NO. 17,Blush,"a muted, medium-dark plummy brown with warm undertones and soft shimmer in hues of pink and gold. The texture felt lightweight and was thin but not as thin as the average shade is in this range. It had sheer coverage that produced a very light hint of color but primarily sheen on my medium skin tone, though layered two or three times gives more noticeable color. It blended out well and looked even applied. On me, the color wore well for eight and a half hours before fading. Charlotte Tilbury Formentera (P, $45.00) is less shimmery, warmer.",A
BARE ESCENTUALS,CRYSTALLIZED,Palette,"a holiday set that’s already on sale, so I guess the timing of this review still works out since now you can get it for even more of a steal than before! It contains eight products, and most of them are full-sized. Everything is in silver-hued packaging. The standsout in the kit are definitely the Eyeshadow Duo (but I’m such a huge fan of the formula, that’s not a surprise) and lipstick.",B+
PAT MCGRATH,VENUS IN FURS,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark, rosy mauve with warm undertones and a satin finish. The lipstick yielded opaque pigmentation in one stroke, which applied evenly across my lips and never tugged or dragged. The consistency was lightweight, velvety, and creamy enough to be comfortable to apply but not so slippery that it was hard to wear. I found the color adhered evenly and did not emphasize my lip lines as some mattes are prone to doing. It wore well for six hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.
",A
PAT MCGRATH,SOFT CORE,Lipstick,"a medium pink with subtle, warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. The color coverage was opaque in one stroke, while the texture felt velvety and smooth with nice glide. It sat fairly well on my lips, particularly given that it was a creamier, denser formula (but felt rather lightweight), but there was a smidgen of product in my deeper lip lines. The color lasted well for six and a half hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.,",A
COLOUR POP,CONTEMPO,Lipstick,"a mid-tone dusty rose with a Matte finish. It’s a muted, medium-dark rosy pink with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff with a soft, lightly creamy consistency that applied without tugging on the lip but didn’t slide around. It lasted for five hours and was neither drying nor hydrating",A-
COLOUR POP,DAZED,Lipstick,"a berry red with a Matte finish. It’s a muted, medium-dark berry-red with cool undertones and a matte finish. It was pigmented but had a little translucency–you can see my lip freckle peeking through–with a lightweight consistency that applied without pulling on the lips. It wore well for six hours and was slightly drying after three hours of wear.",A-
COLOUR POP,GRUNGE,Lipstick,"a cool-toned plum brown with a Matte finish. It’s a muted, medium-dark plummy brown with soft, warm undertones and a cooler overtone (almost like a taupe sheen). The finish was more satiny applied, as there was a visible sheen. It had good pigmentation with a light-medium weight consistency and more creaminess than the last two shades. It wore well for five and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A-
COLOUR POP,NEVERMIND,Lipstick,"a deep blackened violet with a Matte finish. It’s a dark purpled burgundy with subtle, cool undertones and a natural finish. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque color payoff, but the texture had a moderate amount of slip such that the color applied unevenly and settled into lip lines over time. It lasted for four and a half hours before resembling more of a stain. It wasn’t drying at least! MAC Smoked Purple (P, $18.50) is less glossy (95% similar).",D+
COLOUR POP,OH SNAP,Lipstick,"a pale dirty pink with a Matte finish. It’s a light-medium, rosy beige with warm undertones and a soft shine. It had mostly opaque pigmentation with a light-medium weight consistency that was moderately creamy. It wore for four hours on me and was neither drying nor moisturizing in my experience.",A-
COLOUR POP,POISON,Lipstick,"a deep brown red with a Matte finish. It’s a muted, medium-dark brick red with warm undertones and a matte finish. It was intensely pigmented and applied with even coverage, though the texture was stiffer compared to the other five shades. It tugged slightly when I applied it directly from the tube. It wore well over six hours but was somewhat drying.",A-
ESTEE LAUDER,BRAZEN,Lipstick,"a muted, dark reddish-berry with subtle cool undertones and a light sheen. It had semi-opaque coverage that applied unevenly and tended to look patchy in places, while some color migrated into lip lines over time. This type of shade seems problematic across brands, and it’s rare to see a good formulation when there is any glossiness to it (and even still, some matte options don’t apply well). On me, it lasted for five hours and left a stain behind, but the color really settled into lip lines. The formula was moisturizing, though!",C+
ESTEE LAUDER,DANGEROUS,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark brown with hints of warm, rosy red and a soft shine. It had mostly opaque coverage with a creamy, glide-on consistency that gave lips a smoother appearance. This shade wore well for five and a half hours on me and was hydrating over time.",A
ESTEE LAUDER,DARING,Lipstick,"a brightened, medium orange with warm undertones and leans yellower (rather than red), and it had a soft shine. It was fully opaque with a rich, creamy texture that was easy to apply and looked smooth and even on the lips. The formula is comfortable to wear, long-wearing at five and a half hours, and hydrating over time. ",A+
NARS,GLASS METROPOLIS,Lipstick,"eight miniature sized Audacious Lipsticks (each is 0.08 oz., while a full size is 0.14 oz.) housed in a frosted glass box with a mirrored edge in the middle. There’s a lot to love about the set–a decent value (particularly for NARS, which doesn’t have the most value-packed palettes/sets usually), great formula that is seen through all eight shades, and unique, keepsake packaging–but the downside is that the shade range is very narrow with six shades being darker and more autumnal in look and feel. If you’ve been a longtime fan of the Audacious range and have been picking up shades since the launch, you may already have a few from this set, as only one shade, Sarah, is new (and exclusive to the set). I would have loved to have seen more variety in undertone, depth, and overall color selection, which I think would make it more splurge-worthy for more people. It’s a nice set in terms of quality, but I’m not sure if this is going to appeal to as many people as it could with just a few shades switched out. I’d also have loved them to include one or two of their new (and permanent) shades that were recently added to the permanent line-up.
",A
NARS,BETTE,Lipstick,"a rich, deep red-burgundy with subtle, warm undertones and a creamy, lightly glossy finish. It had very nearly opaque pigmentation that covered the lips with smooth, even color. The texture was lightly creamy with moderate slip with a thinner feel than most of the Audacious range, but I didn’t experience any feathering with this shade. The color lasted for six and a half hours, left a stain behind, and was just a touch hydrating.",A
NARS,CHARLOTTE,Lipstick,"a muted, deep red with soft, warm undertones and a natural finish. The pigmentation was fantastic–opaque and even–that wore for over six hours and left a stain behind. The consistency was light-medium in weight, creamy, and comfortable to wear and to apply. The formula was neither drying nor hydrating on me over time.",A
NARS,SANDRA,Lipstick,"a bold, coppery brown with warm, red undertones and a lightly glossy, cream finish. It was intensely pigmented with full color coverage in a single stroke. The consistency was smooth, creamy, and comfortable to wear, as it was thick enough to keep from pulling into lip lines and left my lips looking plumper and smoother. The color lasted for five and a half hours and was hydrating over time.",A
NARS,OLIVIA,Lipstick,"a bold, brighter, medium-dark red with warmer undertones and a glossy, creamy finish. The pigmentation was fully opaque with a creamy, light-medium weight texture that was comfortable to wear. The formula was lightly hydrating, long-wearing at six and a half hours, and didn’t feather on me.",A+
NARS,RITA,Lipstick,"a bright, medium red with warm undertones and a cream finish. The color coverage was fully opaque, while the texture was smooth, creamy, and glided on without tugging. I felt like the thicker texture of this shade pulled into lip lines slightly, though. On me, it wore well for five and a half hours, left a stain behind, and was comfortable to wear.",A
NARS,MARLENE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark rusty orange with warm, red undertones and a cream finish. It had full color coverage with a smooth, light-medium weight consistency that applied with even color. The texture was comfortable to wear and neither drying nor hydrating. It wore well for five and a half hours on me.",A
NARS,ANITA,Lipstick,"a light-medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and a cream finish. It had rich color payoff with a creamy, light-medium weight consistency that was easy to glide on. The lipstick sunk into lip lines slightly initially, and then it was worse after two hours of wear. On me, the color wore for just over four and a half hours and was a touch hydrating.",A-
COLOUR POP,LOST,Lipstick,"a warm-toned brown red. It’s a muted, medium-dark red with warm undertones and a matte finish. This was one of the more matte shades in the range–it dried down rather matte within a few minutes (if you want to speed up drying time, just press your lips together a few times and the sheen lessens). It had rich color payoff with a lightweight, thin texture that applied beautifully and was easy to use for fairly crisp edges (without a lip brush). The color wore well for over eight hours, but it was a little drying after five hours of wear.",A
COLOUR POP,PRIM,Lipstick,"a dark blackened red. It’s a deep, muted burgundy with subtle, warm undertones and a satin sheen. It was intensely pigmented with smooth, even coverage that was easy to work with and didn’t leave streaks behind nor did it pull into lip lines. At this point, I most definitely sound like a broken record, but the majority of color was still going strong after eight hours of wear and still comfortable on.",A
NARS,VIP RED,Lipstick,"a “dark brique.” It’s a medium-dark red with soft, warm undertones and a satin finish. It’s not strongly orange-toned–it has deeper, almost orange-brown tones to it that keep it from being a brighter red, but it isn’t a dark burgundy either. The finish will wear to more of a traditional matte finish within an hour of wear. NARS’ lipstick is supposed to be richly pigmented, long-wearing, and comfortable to wear. I typically have good luck with their pigmentation and wear, but the hydration/comfort tends to be the area the formula misses more on. VIP Red is mostly opaque with a barely creamy consistency that just slightly tugs on the lips, though it doesn’t drag or skip, but it is best applied in shorter strokes rather than one continuous glide. The texture is light-medium in weight, clings without being painfully clingy, and wears for over six hours while leaving behind a stain. It was slightly drying after four hours of wear on me. There was no discernible scent or taste from the formula.",A-
MAYBELLINE,PINK TRUFFLE,Lipstick,"a warm rosy pink with subtle white micro-shimmer and a naturally glossy finish. It’s a nice everyday-appropriate shade with a little more oomph–still, natural-looking and the finish only adds to how effortless it looks. The color coverage is mostly opaque, though there is some translucency to the color, as you can still see my lip freckle peeking through. This formula is supposed to have sheer to medium color coverage, so this is a wee bit over but not by much.  Lip Butters have a divine consistency that’s really creamy, slick, and easy to apply, but it often comes at the expense of wear.  Pink Truffle was one of the longer-wearing shades I’ve tested from this range–three hours–which is only a little shy of my more typical four hour average for lipsticks. It contains a little less product than the average lipstick (typically 0.10 to 0.12 oz.) and requires more frequent reapplication, but it is a more moisturizing formula.",A-
URBAN DECAY,NAKED ULTIMATE BASICS,Palette,"a new, permanent neutral-hued palette that features 12 shades with one shade that’s shimmery and 11 that are touted as matte (a few have faint sparkle/shimmer in the pan but none of them looked shimmery on the skin to my eye). I don’t have an exact release date, just that it will be debuting in September and will be available at all retailers that sell Urban Decay (but I’d expect it to launch on Urban Decay’s website first).

If you’re unfamiliar with Urban Decay’s eyeshadow formula, it is described as having a “velvety texture,” “rich color,” “serious staying power and blendability.” Some the brand’s best mattes are ones like Riff, which really did combine high color payoff with a silky, smooth, and blendable texture that applies well on bare skin as well as with traditional eye primer, but other times, their matte formula has left something to be desired, where the texture has been thin, chalky, dusty, and/or less pigmented.

Naked Ultimate Basics sits somewhere in-between for me overall; the texture is nowhere near as smooth or as finely-milled as I have seen from the brand, but it isn’t as dusty nor as dry as the shades in Naked Smoky. The press was firm enough that the majority of shades didn’t kick up too much excess product in the pan, had decent pigmentation, wear, and blendability, but there were some troublemakers (Instinct, Lethal, Magnet) that were harder to work with, even over primer. Most of the matte shades darkened slightly when I applied them to my skin compared to how they appeared in their pans.",B-
SMASHBOX,MATTE,Palette,"a small, travel-friendly palette that features all matte eyeshadows in warmer, neutral hues. The formula is supposed to be “highly pigmented” with a “beyond blendable” texture. The mattes in the palette are decent to good, but they definitely beg for a primer to perform well; without, they had a tendency to sheer out, apply a bit unevenly, and had moderate fallout during wear. The wear time varied from shade to shade–six to seven hours–but all eight had softer textures and none felt firm/stiff in the pan.",B-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,THE SOCIAL BUTTERFLY (230),Palette,"a new, exclusive eyeshadow palette to Neiman Marcus/Bergdorf Gooodman. It is a neutral palette with a mix of mattes and shimmers, slightly cooler-than-average warmer shades. I had trouble with the two darkest shades–they could have been easier to work with when it came to blending, but if you normally wear primer, it may not be so noticeable.",B+
HOURGLASS,SURREAL LIGHT,Palette,"a finishing powder, bronzer, two blushes, and highlighter inspired by Surreal Light, which is a new shade in the Ambient Lighting Powder family (currently only available in this palette). This palette will work best for someone who is less concerned about a “value-packed” palette/is unlikely to finish their products and really needs everything in a single compact. I think the palette, all being in the same family of Surreal Light, ends up getting muddled a bit between the blush, bronzer, and highlighter with the Surreal Effect blush being the one lone shade that stands out as a bit different. It is a distinctively warm-toned palette, so it will likely not work for everyone. The texture seemed a bit drier across the majority of the powders as the permanent range, though I did not notice the dryness as applied to the face in practice.

Like last year’s palette, the only value is in whether you like the idea of getting five shades for less than the cost of two or three full-sized Hourglass Ambient Lighting products (which range from $38 to $50 in price). There’s only $53.30 worth of product in the palette, so it’s obviously not a value-packed palette. This is something that will be best for someone who wants everything in a single palette and will wear at least three of the five shades often. This year’s palette is marginally better in value than last year’s (which was $48.05 in product value at the same $80.00 price point), but their palettes prior to that were significantly better in value.
",B+
MAC,SPRING FLOCK,Blush,"a light bright coral. It’s a light-medium, pinky-coral with warm undertones and a satiny sheen. It had good pigmentation with a soft, lightly powdery consistency that applied evenly, smoothly, and blended out easily but did not look powdery on the skin. The color started to fade after eight hours of wear.",A
MAC,WHAT I FANCY,Blush,"a soft bright apricot. It’s a light-medium pink with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had a very “strawberry milk” color to it. The texture was soft, silky, and smooth, but it was a little more powdery than other shades in the launch. I don’t think it looked that way applied, and it blended nicely on the skin, though it tended to sheer out a little and was harder to keep at full intensity. This shade lasted well for eight hours.",B
MAC,POOL PARTY,Palette,"three coordinated blushes in medium-sized compact. The blush formula is supposed to be “finely-milled” and “full-pigmented” for “buildable intensity with a seamless finish.” Based on my interpretation, it seemed to say that it was buildable up to full coverage. This trio was a mixed bag of decent to good with variability in pigmentation (two were buildable, one was pretty pigmented), one was harder to blend out, and one that applied beautifully.

There are five trios available. They are presently available through Anastasia directly and will be available online at other retailers on June 13th and in stores on June 23rd.",B+
HOURGLASS,RADIANT MAGENTA,Blush,"a golden fuchsia. It’s a light-medium, warm-toned pink with a satin finish. The finish is less shimmery/sparkly compared to Diffused Heat. Speaking of that shade, this is darker, but when they’re applied, there is not much of a difference. If you have a cooler complexion, you might see more of the pink tones of Radiant Magenta come forward. The texture of the powder is soft, finely-milled, but it can be somewhat powdery to work with. On the skin, it did not look powdery or cakey, even as I layered and built up the intensity (I am normal-to-dry). The way this powder feels is much like the Ambient Lighting Powders. It is nicely pigmented with buildable, even color, and it’s easy to blend out the edges or sheer out the color if you’ve over-applied, as it is a very forgiving powder that yields a soft, luminous sheen that does not emphasize pores. When I wore this shade, the color wore well for eight hours before I started to see signs of fading.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,SOFTCORE,Palette,"highlighter and blush. Though pricey, as far as Tom Ford goes, the duo is actually a bit of a steal–it contains 0.70 oz. of product, which is over double the amount of product contained in a Cheek Color single (0.28 oz.), and those retail for $55. There was some confusion in regards to which duo was named what, but I purchased one of each direct from the Tom Ford Chicago boutique, and Softcore (featured in this post) is the darker, plummier shade, and Stroked is the lighter, more coral shade. I wish Softcore’s blush color was cooler-toned–more berry than plum–and its highlighter shade pink-toned so that the duos would be more distinct. (I also like the idea of giving a cool and warm-toned option for better coverage of the spectrum of skin tones.) The quality of both shades was nice, long-wearing, and blendable.",A
MAC,SWEET SAMBA,Blush,"a dark pink with tan pearl. It’s a pink-plum with a soft, pearly sheen and neutral-to-cool undertones. It had intense color payoff, so go easy with a brush and lightly tap onto cheeks and then build up the intensity. It’s much easier to build than it is to diffuse and soften if you apply too much. I will be testing out the wear of this shade today.  This had the most forgiving texture and only slightly emphasized pores/the natural texture of the skin.",B+
SMASHBOX,ART. LOVE. COLOR.,Palette,"32 eyeshadows, six blushes, and two highlighters. It’s a disappointing palette as the majority of the shades were somewhere between dry, powdery, and dusty (or some combination thereof) with sheerer coverage and a short-wearing formula.
",C-
VISEART,PLUM/BRONZE (01),Palette,"a six-pan blush palette that is the same size (and contains the same amount) as the eyeshadow palettes. It comes in a black plastic compact with a clear lid. Each palette is divided into two families and is “scaled into three levels of cheek color, ideal for the fairest to deep skin tones.” The powder blush formula is supposed to “apply seamlessly” and have “sheer to fuller coverage.” In general, the blush applied better with a light-to-moderately dense brush, light hand, and built-up in layers rather than immediately packed into place. The texture was smooth but dusty, sometimes powdery, and kicked up excess in the pan, so with some of the richer shades, it was easy to over-apply. The formula played better with my skin when it was normal, whereas drier areas had some trouble with the product adhering to the skin for some shades but not all (if you normally wear a cream or liquid base, you should be good to go). The majority of the blushes in the palettes are mostly matte, and they look very smooth on the skin–they actually seemed to hide texture and pores, which was interesting. Most of the shades lasted at least eight hours on my normal-to-dry skin with some lasting as long as nine and a half hours.",B+
COLOURED RAINE,WHO ME,Eyeshadow,"a deep coppery bronze with warm, red undertones and a frosted sheen. The consistency was soft, dense without being firm or stiff in the pan, and very blendable on the lid. It had rich, opaque color coverage that applied well without primer and lasted for eight and a half hours before creasing.",A
COLOURED RAINE,DOWNTOWN,Eyeshadow,"a deep copper with warm, red undertones and a sparkling, metallic finish. It had intense color coverage with a thicker, creamier texture (but it was still a powder eyeshadow) that applied with the same richness on the lid (without primer) as it appeared in the pan. I noticed that when I used it on the inner lid, it could emphasize the texture of my lids slightly due to the thicker texture and metallic finish. On me, the eyeshadow wore well for nine hours before creasing slightly.",A
COLOURED RAINE,GOLDEN OLIVE,Eyeshadow,"a medium-dark golden brown with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. The pigmentation was opaque, while the texture was soft, smooth, and blendable–it was cream-like but not too dense or firm in the pan, so it was easy to work with on the eyes. It lasted for just over eight and a half hours on me.",A
COLOURED RAINE,SECRETS,Eyeshadow,"a deep bronze with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. The consistency was smooth, creamy but still a powder product. It had rich, opaque pigmentation that applied evenly to the lid and blended out easily. The color started to crease after eight and a half hours of wear on me.",A
COLOURED RAINE,INTERGALACTIC,Eyeshadow,"a muted, medium-dark reddened brown with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It applied a lot lighter than it appeared in the pan, and it had a much stronger warm, red undertone. The texture was soft, less dense and cream-like compared to the majority of their shimmer eyeshadows; it felt more like a traditional powder eyeshadow. It had good pigmentation, but it sheered out a bit when applied the lid. I also felt like it was hard to diffuse the edges without getting some patchiness. The eyeshadow lasted for eight hours on me.",B
COLOURED RAINE,GINGERBREAD,Eyeshadow,"a medium brown with strong, warm undertones and a matte finish. The consistency was soft, lightly dusty but smooth and blendable on the skin. Despite the dustiness, it applied with opaque coverage even to bare lids. It lasted just over eight hours on me before I noticed signs of fading.",A-
COLOURED RAINE,CHOCOLATE,Eyeshadow,"a dark brown with warm, reddish undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff with a drier, dustier consistency. When I worked with it on the eye, it blended out better than I expected, but I found that it applied best in sheerer layers. The color lasted for eight hours on me before fading.",B
COLOURED RAINE,MOMENTS,Eyeshadow,"a deep red-brown with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had good color coverage–just a tinge shy of fully opaque–with a soft, lightly powdery consistency that was much more blendable in practice than anticipated. (This was the same experience I had with the mattes in the brand’s eyeshadow palette.) The eyeshadow started to fade after eight and a half hours on me.",A-
COLOUR POP,GET LUCKY,Eyeshadow,"a liquid-like true gold. It’s a medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a soft, metallic sheen. It had very good color payoff that went on smoothly and was easy to work with on the lid as it blended beautifully. The color didn’t show any signs of creasing after ten hours of wear.",A
COLOUR POP,LA LA,Eyeshadow,"a true rose gold with an Ultra Metallic finish. It’s a muted, coppery-brown with a hint of pink and a frosted, metallic finish. It had rich pigmentation that went on smoothly and evenly, and it was easily applied with a brush or fingertip (whichever method you prefer, really, as the results were the same either way). I wore it for ten hours, and it still looked immaculate after that time period.",A+
COLOUR POP,EVE,Eyeshadow,"a dirty antique gold with an Ultra Metallic finish. It’s a rich, bronzy brown with a golden sheen. The color payoff was excellent with rich, full color coverage. The consistency was blendable, smooth, and applied beautifully to the skin, while the color lasted for ten hours without fading or creasing.",A+
COLOUR POP,MITTENS,Eyeshadow,"a deep warm brown with a matte finish. It’s a dark, burgundy-brown with warm, red undertones and a satin finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff that was easy to blend, but it is more prone to sheering out compared to the other shades featured in this review. It was easy to blend and work into the crease, though, so it is also forgiving. Once on, the color stayed on well for ten hours. This was a limited edition holiday set that was just released on its own as part of the matte collection",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,D652 CELESTIAL EARTH,Eyeshadow,"a deepened bronze with warm undertones and a metallic sheen. It had intense color payoff that went on smoothly and evenly due to its very soft, creamy texture. It lasted for nine hours on me.",A
TOO FACED,A LA MODE,Eyeshadow,"nine eyeshadows–three of which are larger, six are smaller in size. Too Faced also likes to separate their shades into Day, Classic, and Fashion, and there’s an included booklet that shares how to use each as a look, but don’t feel confined to how they’re ordered! The palette is a great value, as you’re getting the equivalent of almost eight full-sized eyeshadows (considering the average eyeshadow is 0.05 oz.), though the lighter shades are significantly larger, and you may or may not use them accordingly. I love that the palette is well under the $50 price point, and you’re still getting nine shades to play with. In general, this palette is rather shimmery, so if you tend to incorporate more satin/matte finishes into your looks, you may find this impractical to use as a standalone palette and would need to add in your favorite mattes. It is also a very warm-toned palette, which may or may not be a happy thing.",A-
COLOUR POP,GIMME MORE,Palette,"six highlighters in a slim, cardboard palette. It is new and limited edition, and presently sold out, but the palette will be restocked at a future date. The brand’s Pressed Powder Highlighter formula is supposed to have a “high-shine” finish with “butter-soft powders” that have “high colour intensity.” All six were denser with some having a very creamy, smooth consistency and a couple felt sparklier and not as smooth to the touch. They varied between frosted to sparkly but were certainly more intense highlighters. On me, most of the shades lasted for eight to nine hours. Overall, while they did not have the best texture throughout when swatched, they seemed to sit better on the skin after being diffused and blended.",B+
DIOR,TRANSATLANTIQUE,Highlighter,"a soft golden glow. It’s a brightened, light-medium yellow gold with a frosted, metallic finish. It had very rich color payoff, and in a highlighter that’s as metallic/frosted as this, it makes it a little more difficult to apply as a little goes a long way–and more than a little is a recipe for emphasized pores. I applied this with a stippling brush (MAC’s 131) with a light hand along the tops of cheek bones and down the bridge of my nose, and I still felt like it slightly emphasized the texture of the area. It was quite reflective, though, that seemed to almost mitigate some of that emphasis that I saw when I looked closer in the mirror. The texture of the powder was soft, finely-milled, and smooth; it was also effortless to blend it out on the skin. When I wore it, the highlighter wore well for eight hours before starting to fade slightly.

I bought mine as soon as I saw it online for sale (the 20th), received it on the 26th, and now it’s gone! If it’s something that interests you, it’s a Saks’ exclusive, so you’ll have to track it down in-store.",A-
MAYBELLINE,MOLTEN GOLD,Highlighter,"a brighter, medium gold with warm, orange undertones and a metallic sheen. It’s supposed to have a “chrome effect” that can be applied “lightly for a subtle glow” or built up for a “bold melted metal look.”

It was quite pigmented in a single layer, though the consistency was soft and pliable, so it was easy to control the amount of product picked up on a brush to get sheerer coverage. The texture was smooth to the touch, soft enough that it was a touch powdery in the pan, but it did not look dry or powdery on the skin. On the cheekbones, it had a noticeable glow that did not emphasize my skin’s natural texture. If you wanted really over-the-top, traffic-stopping glow, just spritz your brush (after picking up the product) with a bit of water or facial mist; I found that the texture of this shade was particularly workable damp but is often a trick that can be used with a slew of powder highlighters. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.",B+
BECCA COSMETICS,OCEAN JEWELS,Palette,"five shades of powder highlighter. It’s a limited edition palette for spring. I’d say that the palette is large enough not to be too tedious to use each shade as an individual highlighter, but if you use larger brushes, the pans may be too narrow. The texture throughout the palette was good, but in general, they did not feel as cream-like as the permanent line does to me–there’s just no real impact on performance or application, which is really what matters the most!",A
SEPHORA,JUBILANT (21),Blush,"a brightened, light-medium yellow gold with warm, orange undertones and a frosted sheen. The Colorful Blush formula is supposed to be long-wearing, buildable, and have a lightweight texture. My experience with the formula has shown that they’re soft, lightly powdery at times (some are worse than others) with semi-sheer to semi-opaque color coverage that blends fairly well and lasts seven to eight hours. There is some variance between shades, but there are some gems in the range. Jubilant had semi-sheer to semi-opaque color payoff that illuminated the skin with a luminous sheen that didn’t emphasize the skin’s natural texture or enlarge pores. For farier skin tones, this may work as a blushing highlighter, while darker skin tones may see more highlighting and light brightening. The powder had a smooth, soft-to-the-touch consistency that didn’t run powdery or dry, so it was nicely balanced and blended out beautifully. When I tested it for longevity, the blush/highlighter lasted for eight hours on me.",A-
ANASTASIA,THAT GLOW,Palette,"four warm-toned shades that range from pale, buttery gold to copper. Each shade is 0.26 oz. and can be removed from the palette, if desired, but they are currently only sold together (not sure if they will eventually be available as pans only). Presently, it is exclusive to Macy’s and the brand’s website. According to Anastasia, these are supposed to be “metallic powder highlighters for intense luminosity” that can also be worn on the eyes. They are softer and silkier with a more finely-milled consistency compared to the Illuminators released a couple of months ago. These also have a finer shimmer and overall sheen that is less emphasizing of pores on the skin.",A-
MAKE UP FOR EVER,H106,Highlighter,"brilliant, blinding medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. It was intensely pigmented with a very smooth, almost cream-like texture that was moderately dense but easily blended out on the skin. The powder diffused nicely along the cheeks, and the more I blended it out, the less metallic it became. At full coverage, it did emphasize my skin’s natural texture just slightly, though. On me, this highlighter wore well for eight and a half hours.",A
COLOUR POP,BOOMIN',Highlighter,"a light-medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a soft, metallic sheen. It wasn’t quite as metallic as a lot of the Luster Dusts are and was more pearl to metallic–only getting metallic with multiple layers or applied with a dampened brush. The texture was soft, silky, and finely-milled, which made for a very easy-to-pick-up loose product. The pigmentation really depended on the tool, as it was easily opaque with a denser brush and just as easily applied as a sheer sheen using a fan brush. It wore well for eight hours on me before fading slightly.",A-
NARS,FRENZY,Palette,"more of a highlighter/blush concept, as the lightest shade is most similar to other gold highlighters we’ve seen in the past. The formula is a lot easier to work with dry, as it blended nicely and just didn’t take nearly as much effort to work into the skin as a damp application. If you wear foundation underneath these, I would recommend great care and some brush experimentation when using the formula damp, as using NARS’ Wet/Dry Blush Brush lifts the color and doesn’t blend the color well at all. I think this duo was a lot more flattering on the skin, as the texture wasn’t emphasized terribly (compared the first one I reviewed). NARS is touting these as a wet/dry formula with the wet formula yielding a “translucent wash of color,” which is really the opposite of my experience, as applying either shade with a dampened brush intensifies both the color and the finish (if it has any shimmer)–this would have rated a B+ if it was described as most wet/dry formulas were (including their own Dual-Intensity Eyeshadow formula, which is damp application yields greater pigment/intensity).",B
COLOURED RAINE,SELFIE,Highlighter,"a light, peachy orange with warm, yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. It had buildable pigmentation from medium to mostly opaque coverage. The highlighter had a firmer, smooth texture that was dense and almost cream-like, so it did require a denser brush to perform well as more feathery brushes just did not pick up much product in a single swipe (or swirl). On the upside, even when applied heavily, this one just reflected light and looked incredibly shiny–but smooth! without emphasizing my skin’s natural texture. I did feel like it applied and looked lighter on than it did in the pan (more like a pale yellow gold) on me. It wore well for almost nine hours on me before fading. The Focal Point Glowlighter formula is supposed to be “butter soft” with “high impact luminous glow.” There are eight shades available from pale duochromes to deep coppers (view all swatches here). The formula was denser, firmer, and a little creamier than the average powder highlighter, so fluffy, less dense brushes had trouble picking up a lot of product, whereas denser highlighting brushes and blush brushes picked up product just fine. Most of the shades were quite smooth in feel with medium to full coverage and a strong, reflective shine on the skin and lasted for eight to nine hours. If you’re someone who likes buildable highlighters from medium to opaque with a metallic sheen, these might be right up your alley.",B+
MAC,FLASH AND AWE,Palette,"a new, limited edition warm peach and gold-hued highlighting trio that launches on February 15th. The formula was lovely to work with–smooth, almost creamy–and they all had a high-shine finish that could be called “hyper real.” The downside is that the shades run together once on the skin, so I felt like it was odd to make it a trio (might as well have just released singles).
",A
BECCA COSMETICS,ROYAL GLOW,Highlighter,"a soft, peachy gold with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. It had excellent pigmentation with a smooth, soft, and blendable texture that wasn’t too firmly nor too softly pressed in the pan. I felt that the finish on this shade was less intense and easier to build up on the skin compared to other iterations, while the color feels a little too similar to their permanent range (for someone who may already own a few). The highlighter lasted nicely for eight and a half hours before fading slightly.",A
MAKEUP GEEK,KATHLEEN LIGHTS,Palette,"three warm-toned highlighters–peachy gold, rosy pink, golden bronze–that leans toward the more extreme of highlighters, as they’re very shimmery and produce a strong sheen when applied. They are easiest to use at medium or higher coverage, but with a light touch and a feathery brush, you can get a less intense look. The powders were consistent in feel, performance, and payoff: they were soft, just a smidgen dusty but blendable on the skin with rich color payoff and a high-shine, frosted finish. I had a noticeable emphasis of pores when I wore the shades at medium or greater coverage. All three shades lasted a solid eight hours on me before fading. On my light-medium skin tone, all three produced some color as well as shine, so I expect that lighter skin tones will find these more to work as highlighting blushes, while darker skin tones will appreciate the lack of white in the bases across these shades. Each shade is 0.25 oz., which is larger than some full-sized highlighters; but as soon as you open the palette, it’s clear that you’re getting a ton of product. I think they could have definitely gone with smaller pans and decreased price, but at least you’ll know you’re getting a good value for the price!
",A-
LAURA MERCIER,FALL IN LOVE,Palette,"four, miniature-sized versions of the permanent Face Illuminators. It’s pretty neat, as they have the same swirled, raised design, but everything is on a smaller scale. For someone who likes different highlighter shades (or highlighting blushes/bronzers) and would use two or three of them, it’s handy to have and would be good for traveling. Since the individual Illuminators are pricey, this is a good way to try them all for less than the cost of two full-sized shades. I think that the palette versions are fairly comparable to the permanent versions I have, though there are a few differences that I noticed. I don’t think that those differences really impact the overall look of the products applied, but they are there. This formula (and thus palette) is most suitable for someone who likes moderate highlights and some sparkle but not over-the-top metallic highlighters.",A-
BECCA COSMETICS,PROSECCO POP,Highlighter,"medium gold with warm, yellow undertones and a pearly finish. It had semi-sheer, buildable coverage (up to semi-opaque) with fine, but noticeable, pearl. The Liquid formulation is typically the sheerest of the highlighting formulas, but I found that Prosecco Pop had more pigmentation and a stronger sheen compared to previously released shades. The product had a more gel-like texture that didn’t feel watery or drip along the skin (I pumped the product onto the back of my hand, and it stayed in place). It was easily blended out as a sheer highlight on cheek bones or mixed with base products. On its own, it lasted seven and a half hours on me.",A-
COLOUR POP,MERMAID GLOW,Palette,"a peach-orange blush and a warm, yellow gold highlighter. The two definitely complement each other, and the matte finish of the blush worked to create a more buildable shimmer level when adding the highlighter on top. I actually prefer this size for ColourPop’s cheek colors as their normal size is extremely large (relative to industry averages), too.",B+
BECCA COSMETICS,CHAMPAGNE COLLECTION,Palette,"two highlighters and three blushes. Each highlighter contains 0.19 oz. of product ($51.57 worth), each Mineral blush contains 0.12 oz. ($38.40 worth), and the Luminous blush contains 0.10 oz. ($16.19 worth)–the palette has a total value of $106.16 or $10.40 per shade. I think there’s plenty of each product, and the size of each pan (even the smaller blushes) is appropriate and can be used with a slew of blush and highlighter brushes. Like other Becca palettes, the texture is noticeably drier and looser in the pan for the highlighters, compared to the standalone formula, which is something I notice more by feel and initial application, but it doesn’t seem to change the color, tone, or the way the product looks applied and blended on the skin (this is my only hesitation about the palette). Worth noting, Becca called out the Mineral Blushes as matte, but their interpretation of matte is more like true satin–there is a sheen to the skin but is not overly shimmery, and secondly, Becca seems to market their blushes as more buildable/medium in coverage but all three are very pigmented–this is, as a result, reflected in the rating but if you like your blushes pigmented, you should mentally bump up the ratings. Overall, it is a nice cheek palette, though it leans very warm and coral-toned with three of five having higher-sheen finishes so it’ll be best for those who like their golds and pink-corals and more of a metallic finish than a subtle highlight. I think making either Rose Spritz or Pamplemousse more of a cooler-toned shade would have helped make the palette more versatile (maybe a mauve or plum). The packaging is heft, very solid, and some might even find it a little too heavy to carry in an everyday bag. It clicks closed, and the lid stays up, so it is usable–probably some of the nicest cheek/face palette packaging released in awhile. For me, personally, it’s very easy to wear on my coloring, and as they’re all blendable, they are easy to use as well. I could definitely see traveling with this one.",A-
TARTE,SKIN TWINKLE VOL. 2,Palette,"a slim, rectangular compact that contains four highlighters from white gold to medium bronze. It is a follow-up to last spring’s Skin Twinkle palette, and it is definitely much improved, because it did not contain a “universal matte sand” shade for brightening the under eye (which was definitely not universal), and that particular shade actually had a more papery, dry texture that was strange. This year’s palette was more consistent, and all four shades are highlighters, so it’s a bit more fitting for more skin tones as a result. The brand also increased the value/amount in the palette to 0.70 oz., compared to last year’s which only contained 0.49 oz. (and they are the same price). If you aren’t already inundated with highlighters, it’s a nice set. All four shades were very dupable, though, so for those who already have a few go-to highlighters, definitely check your stash for redundancy. For the most part, they’re soft, smooth, blendable, and definitely yield a glow (rather high-shine than “natural” based on their marketing) with good pigmentation and eight-hour wear.
",B+
OFRA,RODEO DRIVE,Highlighter,"a pop of light-medium gold with strong, warm peachy undertones and a metallic finish. The texture was soft,lightly creamy, and dense with a slightly thicker consistency compared to most powder-based products. It had opaque pigmentation a single layer, and a little went a long way so one could definitely use something like a fan brush to achieve less-intense shine and coverage. The highlighter applied evenly on my cheekbones and blended out easily. It yielded a strong, metallic shine that stopped short of accentuating my skin’s natural texture. The color stayed on well for eight and a half hours on me before it started to fade noticeably.",A
URBAN DECAY,O.N.S. AFTERGLOW,Palette,"a new, limited edition four-pan palette featuring warm-toned, powder highlighters. The formula is supposed to b buildable from sheer, which was the “problem” in the palette–three of the four shades were rather pigmented with one being truly sheer and buildable with another that ended up being sheerer upon application to the cheek due to a denser, firmer texture.",B+
MAKE UP FOR EVER,#02,Highlighter,"a bright, medium gold with warm, coppery-brown undertones and a metallic sheen. The pigmentation was mostly opaque, while the consistency was soft, fairly smooth, and blendable. The product spread evenly across the skin and edges were easily diffused for a gradual blend. I did not find the finish emphasized my skin’s natural texture. It lasted for eight hours on me before starting to fade.",A-
COLOUR POP,IN-NUDE-ENDO,Palette,"a six-pan, warm-toned highlighting palette that is more suitable for someone who loves a shiny, metallic finish. One shade fell a bit short of expectations, but it seemed to get softer over time and wasn’t difficult to apply (so it was mostly a pigmentation issue).
",A
L'OREAL,GOLDEN,Highlighter,"a bright, metallic gold with warm, orange-yellow undertones and a metallic sheen. It was semi-opaque but sheers out quite a bit in practice. It dries down very quickly and is difficult to get to look even–I had the best luck using fingertips with this one. Using a brush resulted in the product drying on the brush and little to none transferring to my skin. It lasted for eight hours on me before turning patchy.",B+
JOSIE MARAN,ARGAN ENLIGHTENMENT (ORIGINAL),Highlighter,"a golden champagne wi th warm, peachy tones and a soft, frosted sheen. Now that we’ve looked at the powder and liquid versions of the Argan Enlightenment Illuminizer range, we finish with the Wand option. This is a cream version, so it is an emollient solid stick that twists-up. The formula is supposed to “mimic the natural radiance of healthy skin” in a more portable option. The texture of the cream version is lightweight with a slightly glossy finish initially that dries down to more of a luminous sheen that doesn’t emphasize pores. It doesn’t add much color to my medium complexion, but it may warm up fairer skin tones. It wore well for seven and a half hours before fading slightly. It worked well over and under foundation, as well as on bare skin. If you want to apply over foundation, I recommend patting the product on with your fingertips or with a stippling brush by lightly skimming over the surface. If you use it directly from the tube, you may find it will lift your foundation (depending on what you’re wearing and how much pressure you use–it is more foolproof with fingers/brushes). For me, I think this is the better option if you want a cream or liquid (something more emollient and typically more forgiving on drier skin types) for specific highlighting, rather than all-over; for mixing with foundations or moisturizers, the liquid is your best bet. For greatest ease and the lowest shimmer amount, the powder is going to be the one you’d want to check out. I love that Josie Maran offered three different types, but I’d love to see more shades, and at the very least, something cooler in tone.",A
MAC,ANTONIO LOPEZ FACE/CORAL,Palette,"an iridescent powder (0.12 oz.), blush (0.13 oz.), and beauty powder (0.20 oz.). It’s a limited edition palette that releases on September 12th. I can’t remember the last time a full-sized Iridescent powder came out (to my recollection, which is not infallible, there were some in Fafi, which were $21 a pop and contained 0.28 oz., and blushes were $17.50 then, so my guess is these would be around $24), and then blushes are typically $21.00 for 0.21 oz. and beauty powders are typically $24.00 for 0.35 oz. So the palette contains $9.00 worth of iidescent powder, $13.00 worth of blush, and $13.71 worth of beauty powder–a total value of $35.72. You pay for convenience and variety, but if you only used one or two shades, you might consider finding similar products individually.",B
IT COSMETICS,HELLO LIGHT,Highlighter,"a warm-toned, medium beige with a frosted finish. This is supposed to give a “true airbrushed look that works on all ages.” It’s also supposed to give a “natural radiance” while blurring pores and imperfections. It’s actually a very chameleon-like product, because in the pan and when photographed, it looks almost golden beige, but I noticed that at times, it looked almost showed as a silvery-white gleam on my medium complexion–ashy in a way, so it might be better suited for fairer skin tones. For a less pronounced sheen, I would recommend a stippling brush and a lighter hand. It doesn’t have glitter, but it has very, very fine shimmer that translates into a highly reflective sheen. The only way I could get this to apply and not look metallic was with a fan brush and use very, very little product. It didn’t do well on drier skin, as it emphasized the imperfections. I don’t feel like this blurred any pores or imperfections on my skin at all. The texture is incredibly soft and finely-milled, almost buttery, and really feels like silk. I love a good highlighter, and there are so many I love and reach for, but this one felt like three times the work to get just right. Once on, it lasts eight hours on me.
",B+
JOSIE MARAN,ARGAN ENLIGHTENMENT (ORIGINAL),Highlighter,"a soft, muted yellow beige with a pearly gold shimmer-sheen. It’s supposed to be a “creamy highlighting powder” that will give you a “lit-from-within radiance.” For anyone in the market for a warm-toned, more subtle highlighting powder, you may find this fits the bill. It’s really hard to overdo it, because the finish is subtly luminous rather than overtly shimmery. The texture is incredibly silky and smooth–it does, in fact, feel almost like a cream because it is so smooth without being powdery, which made it incredibly blendable and helped it sit well on the skin (no emphasis of pores or dryness). On my medium complexion, it doesn’t look yellow or give much color, just a soft sheen to the skin, but fairer complexions may see a stronger warmth when applied, though I think application will be sheer enough that it won’t be yellow. It’s a sweet spot between beige and gold without being too yellow or too orange. The powder highlighter wore well for eight and a half hours before fading slightly. I’ll also be revieweing the liquid and cream version soon, but I can tell you that the powder is the least shimmery/frosted and is a bit more yellow-based.",A
MAC,SOFT & GENTLE,Highlighter,"a gilded peach bronze. It’s a light, golden beige with warm undertones and a sparkling, metallic sheen. MAC’s Mineralize Skinfinish formula is supposed to add “highlight to the face and body” with a “velvety soft” texture and “radiant finish.” Soft & Gentle had semi-sheer to semi-opaque, buildable coverage that produces primarily shimmer on my skin tone (medium), but on fairer complexions may also add warmth and some color. It doesn’t have a white base, so it should work on most complexions, but it may be a highlighting blush on some and just a highlighter on others. The texture is soft but dusty, and this made it prone to sheering out–I recommend using less and building in layers to better control the placement of the product. This shade lasted for seven and a half hours on me before fading.",B+
COLOUR POP,HIGHLY WAISTED,Highlighter,"a soft golden peach with pink and gold duochrome.”It’s a light-medium, yellowed peach with pink and gold shimmer that shifts to a distinct pearly pink sheen when the light catches the cheekbones just-so. This shade had good color payoff, though it wasn’t completely opaque when applied with fingertips unless layered. The texture was smooth, lightly creamy, thin, and lightweight, which made it very blendable on the skin and easily wore over bare skin or on top of your base products of choice. That thinner texture makes it easy to skim the product across the surface of the skin without disrupting base products underneath. Highly Waisted has a visible duochrome, which gives a real pink-gold coloring at times, but for medium complexions or darker, I’d recommend wearing a blush or bronzer to coordinate, or else it appears as if there is almost no color on the skin, while fairer complexions will likely get light warmth even when viewed straight-on. It’s a shade that may be a highlighter on some skin tones and a highlighting blush on others. It had a noticeable, lightly metallic sheen, but it didn’t emphasize pores or the skin’s natural texture. On me, it lasted for eight and a half hours. The duochrome finish made this highlighter one of the more unique ones I’ve come across.
",A
MAC,PINK NOUVEAU,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium bubblegum pink with cool, blue undertones and a cream finish. It had nearly opaque color coverage, though the natural lip color still came through (seemed more noticeable on my upper lip). The texture was smooth, moderately tacky, but while it spread easily, there was some color that gathered in my lip lines. This shade wore well for five hours and was hydrating over time.",B+
JOUER,REGENT,Lipgloss,"a medium pink with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff that applied decently, but there was light streaking along the edges and noticeable settling in my lip lines. The gloss had a very smooth, creamy consistency that was thin but non-sticky and spreadable. It wore well for four hours on me and was lightly moisturizing over time. The formula is supposed to have “full-coverage color that glides on smoothly and moisturizers the lips” with a “non-sticky” texture. The majority of the shades were semi-opaque or more pigmented with a thin, creamy texture that felt more like a hybrid between gloss and liquid lipstick than a true gloss. Despite being thinner, the gloss spread well over the lips and most shades applied evenly. There were a few shades that seemed prone to settling into my lip lines, though. They were average wearing from three to five hours with no feathering or bleeding. The formula was lightly hydrating and non-sticky with a sweet vanilla scent but no discernible taste.",B
NARS,ANGELIKA,Lipgloss,"a cotton candy pink with gold particles. It’s a cool-toned, light-medium pink with blue undertones and subtle gold sparkle. It had semi-sheer color coverage, but it did not apply evenly and tended to settle into lip lines. It lasted for four hours, which is about average for me. ",C+
MILANI,PINK LADY (07),Lipgloss,"a cool-toned, blue-based medium pink with a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, but it wouldn’t apply evenly at all! It looked splotchy and as if it had settled into lip lines yet not fully. When I wore it, the color lasted for three hours.",C+
NYX,STRAWBERRY PARFAIT,Lipgloss," a fuchsia. It’s a medium, cool-toned pink with a cream finish. It had semi-sheer color coverage, which applied so-so; it blended in more with the natural lip color, which helped camouflage the unevenness, but it was there. This shade wore well for two and a half hours on me.",B
MAC,CAROUSEL,Lipgloss,"a bright, cotton candy pink with cool, blue undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that covered with very little streaking, but the color sunk into lip lines, which may be a deal-breaker for some. The texture was light-medium in weight, moderately tacky, but it didn’t feel too heavy. This shade lasted for five hours and was slightly hydrating for me.",B+
MAC,PATENTPINK,Lipstick," a washed-out lilac. It’s a cool-toned, light pink with bluish-gray undertones and a light shine. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, which applied somewhat evenly–more evenly than anticipated for this type of color–but could use improvement in that area. It wore well for just over two hours.",C
LORAC,FOODIE,Lipgloss,"a light-medium pink with warm undertones and fine gold pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied decently, but there were some noticeable streaks and color that gathered in my lip lines. The settling did not seem as apparent with this shade as it was with the others, though. The gloss felt creamy, lightweight, and mostly non-sticky. It wore well for three hours and was lightly hydrating.",B-
MAC,PURE FICTION,Lipgloss,"a mid-tone violet pink. It’s a cool-toned, light-medium pink with blue undertones and a milky, creamy finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, and it did settle somewhat into lip lines, unfortunately! This shade lasted for three and a half hours on me.",B-
MAC,SAINT GERMAIN,Lipgloss,"a light-medium pink with strong, cool, blue undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff that applied decently, but there were areas where it could have been more even, and there was color that had pulled into my lip lines. The consistency felt somewhat stickky, but the gloss itself was smooth, not too heavy, and comfortable to wear over the four and a half hours it lasted.
",B-
ANASTASIA,PASTEL PINK,Lipgloss,"a milky, light pink with a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that went on surprisingly evenly, though some of the color slipped into lip lines; it really applied better than a lot of similarly-hued glosses in my experience, though there is still room for improvement. This shade wore well for four hours and was hydrating while worn.",B+
NYX,MERENGUE,Lipgloss,"a pink lilac. It’s a cool-toned, light cotton candy pink with blue undertones and a cream finish. It’s the type of milky pink that looks pretty in the tube, but it doesn’t work as well on its own as the color settles into lip lines. It had semi-opaque pigmentation. This one applies better than many iterations I’ve tried, but it doesn’t look great by itself–it’s really a product that would be better layered over a lipstick or lip liner. The gloss wore three hours on me.",B
LORAC,PASTRY CHEF,Lipgloss,"a brighter, light-medium pink with subtle, cool undertones and fine, lavender pearl. The pearl was so fine (but plentiful!) that it gave a nearly metallic sheen. It had good pigmentation, though not opaque, that covered the lips with even coverage without streaking, but there was noticeable color in my lip lines that made it less-than-flattering applied. The consistency was easy to spread across the lips, comfortable to wear, and smooth. This shade wore well for three and a half hours and was hydrating.",B
MAC,PURE SILLINESS,Lipgloss,"a creamy lilac. It’s a cool-toned, light-medium pink-purple with a creamy, glossy finish. It applied terribly unevenly, though it had semi-opaque color coverage. The color wore well for four hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,XAVIER,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, raspberry pink with cool undertones and a subtle pearl shimmer. It had semi-opaque color coverage–noticeable color but a fair amount of the natural lip color will come through. It lasted for five hours on me and was lightly hydrating. Xavier is also the same as Violet Fatale.",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,APHRODISIAC,Lipstick,"a bright pop of blue-based medium-dark pink that has a subtle sheen in its finish. It’s a high-quality lipstick formula–opaque in one pass, long-wearing (six hours), hydrating, and doesn’t bleed or feather on me. It’s comfortable to wear and easy to apply, as it’s very nice on and wears well and fades evenly. It is lightly scented with a sweetened vanilla (very similar to MAC’s) but has no detectable taste. Is it gorgeous? Absolutely. Is it dupeable? Yes, definitely. Whether the formula is worth the luxury price tag is up to you, but if the color appeals to you and the price makes you cringe, there are several permanent dupes available (listed above).",A+
MAC,CATHARINA,Lipstick,"a bold, bright fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a luminous finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage, but there’s a slight translucency that gives it a lighter look applied to the lips. This shade lasted for five hours on me and was lightly hydrating. It had moderately slick, glide-on consistency with a bit of tackiness while worn.",A-
MAC,ULTRAMARINE PINK,Lipstick,"a mid-tone dirty violet with a Satin finish. It’s a brightened, medium-dark berry-magenta with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. ",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,COOPER,Lipstick,"a lightly brightened, medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a very fine fuchsia pearl. It had very nearly opaque color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly, while the color itself wore well for six hours and left a stain behind. It was comfortable to wear and hydrating over time. It is one of the more dupable shades in the line-up, though.",A
HOURGLASS,I CAN'T WAIT,Lipstick,"a slightly muted, medium-dark plum with warm, red undertones and a cream finish. It was richly pigmented and yielded smooth, even coverage as the formula was lightly creamy and glided on with ease. The texture did not feel overly slippery or too emollient, so it sat well on the lips and stayed on for a solid five and a half hours. It felt moisturizing while worn.",A
MAC,EROS,Lipstick,"a bright, medium fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. The texture was denser and pulled more than other shades, and while I could feel it melting, it did not melt as much and was always a big draggy going on. It had good pigmentation, but it was harder to get smooth, even application; I expect this one to be more unforgiving on those with drier or flakier lips as well. The color lasted a solid six hours, left behind a pinkish stain, and was non-drying.",B
BOBBI BROWN,RASPBERRY PINK,Lipstick,"a bright blue fuchsia. It’s a bold, bright, medium-dark fuchsia pink with strong, blue undertones and a light shine. It had nearly opaque pigmentation with a lightweight, creamy consistency that sat well on lips and made them look smoother and plumper. The texture had less slip than the average shade in the range, but it never tugged and glided on readily from the tube. This shade wore well for six hours and was hydrating while worn.",A
GIVENCHY,FUCHSIA IRRESISTIBLE (205),Lipstick,"a vibrant fuchsia. It’s a bold, bright, cool-toned fuchsia with red tones and a satin sheen. I’m really quite enamored with the Le Rouge formula, and I suspect that next time Sephora has a sale going on, I’ll pick up a few more shades (assuming I can hold off until then!). Fuchsia Irresistible had rich, opaque color in nearly a single pass. The color was lightweight, comfortable, and wore for ages–nearly seven hours, plus left a residual stain. The consistency is creamy but doesn’t have too much slip, so it doesn’t bleed or feather. The formula looks lovely on the lips and really seems to give lips a smoother appearance overall, and it is hydrating when worn and for a couple of hours after it’s worn away.There’s a very faint scent that’s supposed to be mimosa and black currant, but I was hardly able to detect it in the tube and definitely not when applied.",A+
DIOR,ULTRA ATOMIC (660),Lipstick,"a bright, medium fuchsia pink with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied fairly evenly, but it was thinner and had moderate slip, which resulted in a formula that clung to my lips more noticeably and emphasized my lip lines. The lipstick glided across my lips and felt smooth going on, but I was surprised that highlighted my lip texture as most of the range did not. It lasted for four and a half hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",C
HOURGLASS,I ALWAYS,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark pink with warmer undertones and a creamy finish. It had rich, very-nearly-opaque pigmentation that applied beautifully across the lips and never tugged as it glided on. The coverage was even and adhered well to the lips, so it had good wear at five and a half hours. The formula was lightly hydrating and comfortable to wear overall.",A
BITE BEAUTY,RADISH,Lipstick,"a deep magenta. It’s a bright, medium-dark raspberry pink with cool, pink undertones and a satin finish. It had very nearly opaque coverage with a lightweight consistency that had just enough slip to apply with smooth, even color. The color wore well for over six hours and left a stain behind. It was very lightly moisturizing for me. ",A
GUERLAIN,#67,Lipstick,"a rich, raspberry pink with subtle, cool undertones and barely-there pearl paired with a creamy, lightly shiny finish. The pigmentation was good, though not quite opaque in one layer, and it covered my lips evenly without settling into my lip lines. The texture was lightweight, lightly creamy but not overly slippery, and comfortable to wear. The color stayed on well for six hours and kept my lips hydrated over time.
",A
GIORGIO ARMANI,MAHARAJAH (517),Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark raspberry pink with cool undertones and fuchsia pearl. It had semi-opaque pigmentation in a single layer, which was buildable but was never full coverage on me. The lipstick had a velvety feel on the lips that was comfortable to wear and felt very smooth. The glossier finish lasted for two to three hours, while the color lasted closer to six and a half hours with a slight stain that was left behind. It was moisturizing while worn.",A-
MAC,IMPASSIONED,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium pink-coral with subtle, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly, though some color gravitate toward my lip lines–the brighter color and high-shine finish made that less noticeable from a normal viewing distance. The consistency was smooth, moderately tacky, and comfortable to wear. This shade wore well for almost six hours and was lightly hydrating.",A-
DIOR,PLAISIR (779),Lipgloss,"a brightened, medium fuchsia with subtle, warm undertones and a creamy, glossy finish. It had nearly full color coverage that went on evenly and tended to smooth out lip lines, rather than pull into them like the other two shades. The gloss lasted for almost six hours and was comfortable to wear as it was hydrating over time.",A
CHANEL,AMUSE BOUCHE,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium pink-red with cooler undertones and a just a touch of gold sparkle. This was one of the more pigmented shades I tested, as it had semi-opaque coverage and with the brightness of the shade itself, very noticeable on. The consistency was smooth, gel-like, and a touch tacky but not thick or heavy on. The color could have applied more evenly, and there was a little bit of color that pulled into lip lines. The very glossy, high-shine finish made those issues less noticeable at a normal viewing distance, though. This shade lasted for four and a half hours on me and was moisturizing.
",B+
BURBERRY,OXBLOOD NO. 23,Lipgloss,"a slightly muted, medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool undertones and creamy, glossy finish. It had semi-sheer color coverage, which seems in line with the brand’s description (“hint of colour”), and a lightweight, comfortable-to-wear feel on the lips. This shade lasted for four hours on me and was moderately hydrating. It could apply more evenly, though. This color is part of the permanent range, but it will have Burberry’s regular packaging (instead of gold).",B+
GIORGIO ARMANI,#523,Lipgloss,"a vivid, pink-red with cool, blue undertones finished with an incredibly shiny, glossy sheen. It had semi-opaque color coverage–there was a light translucency that let the natural lip color come through slightly. The consistency is less like a traditional gloss, as it has a very gel-like feel that is cushy and plush, lightly tacky. It’s very comfortable to wear, and it’s actually somewhat hydrating while worn. This particular shade lasted six hours on me, which is definitely longer than the average gloss wears for on me. That juicy glossiness that makes lips look plumper lasts for hours and hours, too. The formula is scent- and taste-free.
",A
MAC ,PREPARE FOR PLEASURE,Lipgloss,"a bluish red. It’s a brightened, pink-red with cool, blue undertones. It had semi-opaque color coverage, and it applied evenly overall. It wore for almost three hours.",A-
MAC,GLAM,Lipgloss,"brightened, medium red with cool, blue undertones and a glossy finish. It had rich, opaque color coverage, and the gloss wore well for five hours on me.",A-
ANASTASIA,PETAL,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium-dark fuchsia pink with subtle, warmer undertones and a cream finish. It had opaque color coverage that applied well for the most part (just a touch streaky in a few places but hardly noticeable due to the brightness and opacity of the color). The color lasted for five and a half hours on me.",A
CHRISTIAN LOUBOUTIN,COLIBRETTA,Lipgloss,"a bright, medium-dark pinky-fuchsia with subtle, warmer undertones and a cream finish. It had mostly opaque pigmentation with a gel-like, smooth texture that felt lighter than it looked. It applied evenly, but again, there was a bit of color that gathered in lip lines. I don’t think it’s noticeable from a normal viewing distance, though, so it may not be a deal-breaker. This shade lasted for six hours and was hydrating over time. ",A-
OCC,RHYTHM BOX,Lipgloss,"a translucent purpled burgundy. It looks burugndy-red in the tube, but applied, it’s a cool-toned, pinky-red with hints of berry and a luminous shine. OCC’s new Lip Tar Stained Glosses are a thinner, glossier version of their famous Lip Tars. If you felt like Lip Tar was too opaque or heavy, you may like the Stained Glosses. It’s not sheer color as in barely-there color; indeed, it is exactly like stained glass windows where there is strong, noticeable color that you can still see through. There is some translucency to the color, so the natural lip color comes through (but depending on what that is, it may have little to no effect), but you can see that while burgundy in the tube, it applies much pinker. Rhythm Box lasted eight hours well with moderate glossiness for four hours. It did leave behind a lingering stain for another two hours or so.",A
GUERLAIN,GIGI,Lipstick,"fuchsia-red with cool undertones and a glossy finish. It had rich color payoff that covered well and lasted for six and a half hours, while it left a stain behind. It was nicely hydrating and comfortable to wear. ",A
CHANEL,LA PETILLANTE (49),Lipstick,"a coral red. It’s a brightened, pink-red that has a very slight warmth to it and a satin-matte finish. It was nearly opaque applied to lips with a lightweight, velvety texture that was fairly thin but was comfortable to wear and applied well. It lasted for six hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
NARS,FAMOUS RED,Lipstick,"a bright medium-dark coral-red with warm undertones and a matte finish. It had rich, opaque pigmentation–might be one of the more pigmented shades in the entire line–with a slightly thicker, creamier texture. It had more substance to it than a lot of the range, which felt thinner in comparison. The color wore well for over six hours and was non-drying on me.",A
URBAN DECAY,TRYST,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark coral-red with warm undertones and a matte finish. The pigmentation was mostly opaque, but I would recommend layering a little more on as needed to get full coverage. The consistency was thin and lightweight, but there was some wateriness to it that seemed to contribute to a bit of streaking and settling of color in my lip lines. The dry down was longer but did eventually dry down completely (three to four minutes). It lasted for five and a half hours before fading noticeably on me, and it did seem non-drying.
",B
CHANEL,SEDUISANT (146),Lipstick," a bright, medium-dark pink-coral with warm undertones, fine pearl, and satin finish. It had mostly opaque coverage, though some areas seemed slightly semi-opaque but was hard to tell at a normal viewing distance due to the bright, richer color overall. The texture was smooth, comfortable to wear, and didn’t cling to lips. This shade took almost 45 minutes to really “dry” to its more velvety, semi-matte finish. It wore well for six hours on me and was just a touch hydrating. ",A-
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,JE T'AIME (238),Lipstick,"a rum raspberry. It’s a slightly muted, medium pink-coral with a very subtle shimmer to it over a satin finish. It had good color payoff paired with a lightly creamy consistency that sat on the lips well and didn’t tug during application. The color wore for five and a half hours and was a little drying over time.",B-
MAC,ABLAZE,Lipstick,"a bright apricot cream. It’s a medium-dark coral-red with a barely-there sheen (not quite a flat matte). It’s bold and bright but not neon–there is a lightness to it. Ablaze had rich, opaque color coverage. Though it’s technically a matte finish, it felt more like a satin or amplified creme finish–creamy without being thick or slick, so it applied evenly, smoothly, and didn’t tug or pull at the lips. I tested this one first thing, and it lasted five hours well and did leave a very subtle reddish stain behind. It was, unfortunately, a bit drying but not terribly so.
",A
COLOUR POP,NAKED LADIES,Lipstick,"a bright coral red. It’s a bright, medium coral-red with a semi-matte finish. It had excellent coverage with full opacity, while the texture was thin, spreadable, and comfortable to wear. I noticed this one had more of a semi-matte finish and very little sheen compared to most of the shades I’ve tried in this range, but it isn’t clingy on. This shade was still going strong after six hours. It was neither drying nor hydrating over that period.",A
BITE BEAUTY,PICKLED GINGER,Lipstick,"an electric coral. It’s a bold, bright pink-coral with warm undertones and a satin finish. It was richly pigmented with a lightly creamy consistency that applied well without tugging on the lips. The color wore for over six hours and was lightly hydrating.",A
TARTE,BAE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark red with subtle, cool blue undertones and a satin finish. It had rich, opaque color coverage that applied evenly and smoothly. The texture was lightweight, comfortable to wear, and didn’t cling, but to be sure, this is not a formula that dries down to that very flat, matte finish. It will transfer over time. The color lasted for six hours on me with a fair amount of staining afterwards. It was lightly drying after four hours.",A-
MAC,STUNNER,Lipstick,"a clean red with a Matte finish. It’s a brightened, medium red with cool, pink undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had nearly full color coverage with a lightly creamy texture that was easy to apply. This shade wore well for six hours and left a stain behind. It was a little drying but the least drying of the three.",A-
ESTEE LAUDER,DECISIVE POPPY,Lipstick,"a slightly muted, medium-dark red with neutral-to-cool udnertones and a semi-matte finish. It had mostly opaque pigmentation that covered evenly and applied smoothly without tugging on the lips. The color lasted for eight hours and was neither drying nor hydrating on me.",A
MAC,CHARLOTTE,Lipstick,"a brightened, medium-dark red with subtle, cool undertones and a mostly matte finish. It had good color payoff that covered the lips evenly and smoothly without dragging during application. The color lasted for six hours but was somewhat drying over time.",A
COLOUR POP,VIXEN,Palette,"a limited edition set of six shades for the holidays. I liked the selection of shades, and I appreciate that there is a variety in the finishes (nice to see another shimmery shade from ColourPop!), but two of the six were stiffer and drier to use, which was disappointing.
",B+
MAC,FEELS SO GRAND,Lipstick,"a deep true red. It’s a medium-dark red with neutral-to-cool undertones and a flat, matte finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff with a really smooth, even finish. This shade was one of the better-applying shades in the range and felt a lot more effortless to use. It wore well for seven hours and was drying after four hours.",A-
MAC,HIGH HEELS,Lipstick,"a medium red with neutral-to-cool undertones and a matte finish. The pigmentation was good–not quite opaque but very close to it–and delivered smooth, even coverage in a single layer. It was still going strong after eight hours of wear, but it was drying on me.",A-
KAT VON D,TIJUANA,Lipstick,"a vibrant Spanish red. It’s a bright, medium red with neutral-to-cool undertones. I see pink in the base when I sheer it out, but it pulls closer to neutral to warm against my skin tone. The texture is lightweight and comfortable to wear for the first five hours, and then it gets a little drying after that but wears closer to eight hours. It applies evenly and smoothly without dragging, though it isn’t quite as creamy as a shade like Magick, it is a lot easier to apply than the original Studded Kiss line was for me.",A-
MAC,STEAM HEAT,Lipstick,"a vivid yellow-red with a Satin finish. It’s a medium-dark red with warm, yellow undertones and a satin finish. It had rich pigmentation that covered the lips well with even, smooth application. The consistency was lightly creamy with a sort of velvety, light-medium thick feel that stayed on well. This shade wore for six hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
COLOUR POP,SILHOUETTE,Lipstick,"a rich blue red. It’s a bright, medium red with cool, blue undertones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque coverage with a lightweight, easy-to-apply consistency. This was one of the more comfortable and easier-to-wear shades in the liquid lipstick formula.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,RUBY RUSH (07),Lipstick,"a slightly muted, medium-dark red with subtle, cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. The pigmentation was excellent and yielded full coverage. It had a comfortable, lightweight texture that felt velvety and smooth so the color distributed evenly on the lips. On me, this shade lasted for over six hours and left a stain behind, though it was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
COLOUR POP,CREEPER,Lipstick,"a true classic blue red. It’s a brightened, medium-dark red with cool, blue undertones and a smooth, matte finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage with a soft feel to the touch once dried down. It didn’t budge at all for eight hours, and it faded evenly overall. I found the formula a little drying after five hours of wear.",A-
FENTY BEAUTY,FRECKLE FIESTA,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, coppery orange with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had opaque pigmentation in a single layer that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips and never dragged. The consistency was lightweight, creamy without being heavy or thick on the lips, and had enough slip to be comfortable. There was a slight amount of product that pulled into my deeper lip lines, though I didn’t notice it from a normal viewing distance. This shade wore well for six hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,ORANGE (300),Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange with strong, warm yellow undertones and a creamy, lightly glossy sheen. The product had opaque color coverage that applied evenly on the lis. The texture was smooth, lightweight, not too slippery, and sat fairly well on the lips, but I did notice a little bit of color in my bottom lip lines (the deepest ones). It lasted for five hours on me and was just a touch hydrating.",A-
BITE BEAUTY,WARMED MAPLE,Lipstick,"a brightened, tangerine orange with warm, yellow undertones and a satiny sheen. It was one of the more “matte” shades in the collection of five, though it isn’t truly matte. It had rich, opaque color payoff in a single stroke, while the texture was creamy, light-medium in weight and thickness, and very comfortable to wear. The formula was hydrating over the five and a half hours this shade lasted.",A
BITE BEAUTY,TOURNE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange with warm, yellow undertones and a creamy finish. It was intensely pigmented with smooth, even coverage that applied easily across the lips. The consistency was lightweight, creamy without being too thick or too thin, and was a cinch to maneuver along the edges of the lips for crisp lines. It wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating over time.
",A+
LIPSTICK QUEEN,JUNGLE QUEEN,Lipstick,"a papaya coral. It’s a brightened, medium orange-red with warm undertones and a soft shine. The formula is supposed to be “semi-sheer” and moisturizing with a “hint of luminescence.” It had mostly opaque color coverage, and the only way I could achieve “semi-sheer” color is if I only applied color to the bottom lip, then pressed my lips together, and used a lip brush to even it out–which is really how one might get sheerer coverage out of any fuller coverage formula. For some, this might be a happy accident, for others, it may make this shade to bold or rich. The consistency is lightly creamy, a bit emollient, so it glides on easily and applies the color evenly, but it’s not thick or heavy on. It lasted for five hours on me, and it left behind a soft stain, though it was just lightly hydrating for me.",B+
MAC,FUTURE EMOTIONS,Lipstick,"nine shades of lipstick with a few being from the brand’s permanent range. The biggest thing to note is that where I’ve tried a color in the past (as a traditional, twist-up lipstick), it was always inferior in the palette–thinner, drier, or clingier in the pan version. The second characteristic that seems important to note is that there’s really not much product in the palette; just a little more than a single lipstick (0.10 oz.), which retails for $17.50.",B-
MILANI,SWEET NECTAR,Lipstick,"an orange cream. It’s a medium-dark orange with subtle red tones and a satiny finish. It had rich, full color coverage when applied. The consistency is lightly creamy and glided evenly across lips without pulling or dragging. It’s touted as an opaque, hydrating formula. I found it to be lightly hydrating, but only for the first two to three hours. Sweet Nectar lasted five and a half hours when I wore it. There’s a sweet, somewhat synthetic, fruity scent that felt a bit cloying.",A
ILLAMASQUA,SOAKED,Lipstick,"a vibrant orange. It’s a bright, medium-dark orange with strong, red undertones and a luminous shine. It had intense, opaque color payoff, and the color went on very smoothly. This shade lasted for almost seven hours on me.",A
BOBBI BROWN,ATOMIC ORANGE,Lipstick,"a bright yellow orange. It’s a vibrant, medium orange with warm, red undertones and a natural finish. It was intensely pigmented and had full color coverage. The consistency is creamy, light-to-medium in weight, comfortable wear with a hydrating formula that lasted for five and a half hours on me.",A+
NARS,TIMANFAYA,Lipstick," a mandarin red. It’s a brightened, medium-dark orange with warm, red undertones and a satin finish–just a soft sheen that will gradually turn matte as it wears on. The pencil had a soft, creamy consistency when applied to the lips, where it actually felt almost slippery when I was applying it, but the lip color dried down slightly so it didn’t slip or slide on the lips. It was really pigmented and yielded full, opaque color coverage. The color wore well for almost six hours, and it was neither drying nor hydrating during that time. I only wish NARS would upgrade their packaging by putting the formula into a twist-up pencil, rather than one you have to sharpen, as sharpening always leads to some waste. You can minimize the waste by putting the pencil into the freezer prior to sharpening, though, but I would appreciate the convenience of a twist-up pencil.",A
BITE BEAUTY,CLEMENTINE,Lipstick," a citrus orange. It’s a brightened, medium orange-red with warm undertones and a satin-matte finish. It had full color coverage, which applied evenly and smoothly. The consistency was creamy, lightweight, and didn’t feel clingy. This shade wore well for six hours and was lightly hydrating.",A+
MAC,TART & TRENDY,Lipstick,"a bright neutral orange cream with a Lustre finish. It’s a brightened, medium orange with a luminous finish and warm, slightly yellow undertones. It had mostly opaque color payoff with just a bit of sheerness–but it was definitely more pigmented than the average Lustre (which may be a happy accident for some!). I started my morning off wearing this, and it lasted three and a half hours on me. It felt somewhat drying (which is my typical experience with Lustres, so if you usually find them moisturizing, then we have opposite experiences, on average).",B
GIVENCHY,CORAIL SIGNATURE (317),Lipstick,"a coral orange. It’s a medium orange with warm, reddish undertones and a luminous finish. It had rich, opaque color coverage, and the consistency was creamy and helped it apply smoothly to the lips. This shade wore well for almost five hours on me. It’s a more muted shade of orange with less red in it than the average orange lipstick.",A
MAC,NEON ORANGE,Lipstick,"a bright clean orange with an Amplified finish. It’s a bold, medium orange with strong, warm red undertones and a natural sheen. It had full, opaque color coverage, and it was lightly creamy. This shade is permanent at PRO stores (and regular customers now have access to the majority of the PRO range online). I’ve had this on for nearly four hours, and it’s still going strong. ",A
BITE BEAUTY,PARE,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, coppery orange with warm undertones and a glossy sheen. It had nearly opaque color coverage in a single layer, which applied evenly across the lips. The texture was comfortable to wear and easy to work with on the lips, but it had moderate slip and had a tendency to pull into some of my deeper lip lines. The glossier finish helped distract from that, though, from a normal viewing distance. It lasted for just over five hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",A-
NARS,LANA,Lipstick,"a vivid orange red. It’s a bright, orange-red with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had rich, intense color payoff that applied evenly and smoothly. The color wore well for five and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating over time. While a lovely shade, there are a lot of very similar shades on the market.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,FIRECRACKER (06),Lipstick,"a vibrant, rich, orange-red with warm undertones and a luminous shine. It had really rich, opaque color coverage. It wore well for six hours. ",A-
DIOR,TRAFALGAR (844),Lipstick,"a vibrant, red-orange with a shiny, luminous finish. There’s really no shortage in high-voltage oranges on the market, so you can really pick the formula and price point that best suits you. Dior recently released the latest Rouge Dior Lipstick range, which is supposed to have “luxurious, full-coverage lip color” with a “satiny finish.” It’s a lightweight, lightly creamy, moderately hydrating, and easy to apply formula. Trafalgar was richly pigmented and almost had full coverage in a single stroke. It applied smoothly, evenly, and didn’t bleed or feather outside my natural lip lines. It lasted well for six hours, and it left behind a warm, reddish stain that lingered for another hour or so.",A
MAC,SOPHISTICATE,Palette,"six eyeshadows, two blushes, and two lipsticks. Worth pointing out right away is that the back of my palette says the second blush on the left is Simply Bliss, whereas Nordstrom’s product listing had Cream Soda in its place; I checked both of them, and the blush in this palette is slightly more pink-tinted and a little lighter but not by much.",B-
BITE BEAUTY,GRANDIFOLIA,Lipstick,"a fiery red. It’s a vibrant, orange-red with warm undertones and a luminous shine. The color payoff is intense–extremely rich and full coverage in a single pass. The color lasted for six hours and left behind a warm, reddish stain.",A+
BITE BEAUTY,GTA,Lipstick,"a bright, coral-red with warm undertones and a satin finish. This is an exclusive shade for Canada, which is inspired by Toronto. The consistency was creamy, light-medium in weight, and clings to the lips without feeling dry/uncomfortable, but the wear was fantastic–over six hours and was still going strong. What I like about the formula is how smooth it looks on the lips; it doesn’t emphasize my lip lines or gather in them, so the end result is very smooth, voluminous, and even. The only area of improvement is that it’s only slightly hydrating, but it’s comfortable to wear overall. If you like other shades from the Amuse Bouche formula, this is definitely consistent with the range.",A+
GUERLAIN,GILDA,Lipstick,"a warm red. It’s a slightly muted, medium-dark orange-toned red with warm undertones and a luminous finish. It was intensely pigmented and applied evenly with rich, smooth color. This shade wore well for six and a half hours on me and left behind a light stain. The formula was lightweight, moisturizing, and comfortable to wear.",A+
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,LOVE BITE,Lipstick,"a brightened, medium red with subtle, neutral-to-warm undertones and a luminous finish. I think this may look bluer-based on those with strong, cool undertones, but it seems more neutral to lightly warm-toned when I swatch it next to more distinctively blue-based lipsticks. It had rich, full color coverage that went on evenly and smoothly. This shade wore well for over six hours and left a stain behind. It was lightly hydrating over time and comfortable to wear. There are definitely a lot of similar shades within this type of finish (there are so many that I’ve omitted mattes, but I don’t doubt that there would be matte shades with a similar coloring).",A
ESTEE LAUDER,CARNAL,Lipstick,"a bright, orange-red with a luminous finish and warm undertones. It was intensely pigmented and applied evenly and smoothly. The color lasted for over six hours, and it left behind a reddish stain. The formula was creamy, hydrating, and comfortable to wear without feathering around the edges.",A+
GIVENCHY,CARMIN ESCARPIN (306),Lipstick,"a warm poppy red. It’s a orange-red with warm undertones and a soft, luminous shine. The consistency was lightly creamy, easy to apply, and applied evenly. The color coverage was very nearly opaque, and the lipstick lasted six hours and left behind a soft stain and was nicely hydrating. ",A+
URBAN DECAY,EZ,Lipstick,"a bright red-orange with a Cream finish. It’s a bold, bright, medium-dark coral-red with warm, orange undertones and a natural sheen. It was richly pigmented with opaque color that applied evenly and smoothly. The texture was soft, moderately creamy, but not too thick or too dense, so it didn’t slide around too much when applied (but it isn’t clingy, and it will transfer, as you might expect). The color wore well for six hours and left a stain behind, while the formula was moderately moisturizing. ",A
LAURA MERCIER,CHERRY ON TOP,Lipstick,"a bright, medium orange-red with strong, warm undertones and a creamy, shiny finish. It had rich color payoff with a creamy, lightweight, and emollient texture that applied well with even, crisp lines. The color lasted for four and a half hours and was hydrating while worn.",A
BITE BEAUTY,#003,Lipstick,"a fire red/coral. It’s a bold, bright coral-red with warm undertones and a luminous sheen. I didn’t see any name on the exterior packaging or on the label on the bottom of the lipstick itself, so I’m not sure if “Chilly Pepper” is a brand-given name or if it was created by Sephora. It was intensely pigmented with fully opaque color in a single stroke. The consistency was lightly creamy but not too emollient, so it glided on without tugging on the lips but deposited even, smooth color without streaking. It lasted for six hours on me and left a slight stain behind. I found the formula of this shade to be slightly hydrating over time. As you might have noticed from above, there are numerous shades like it, so if you missed it, don’t fear–there are so many possibilities to satiate the need for a bold coral-red. The good news is that March’s shade delivers a high quality, richly pigmented product, though it doesn’t feel largely different (other than it being a bit thinner and less slippery) from their Luminous Creme formula (to me).
",A
MAC,VERMILLION VEE,Lipstick,"a clean, true red with a Matte finish. It’s a bright, medium coral-red with warm undertones and a satin finish. It had very good pigmentation with a smooth, creamy consistency that applied with even coverage. The color lasted for six hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
MAKEUP GEEK,BEAUTY QUEEN,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a satin finish. The texture was light-medium in thickness and felt velvety going on, so it spread well and yielded even, semi-opaque coverage. The color didn’t seem to gather in my lip lines or appeart “cracked” like it has with other shades in the range. On me, it wore well for six hours, left a stain behind, and was drying.
",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,DYLAN,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark red with neutral undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was incredibly intense and covered the lips with bold, smooth, and even color. The texture was lightweight, creamy without being wet or too slippery, and comfortable to wear. This shade was still going strong after six hours of wear (and left a stain behind) and was hydrating over time.",A+
MAC,SO GOOD FOR YOU,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark red with strong, cool, pink undertones and a matte finish. It had good color payoff, though it wasn’t fully opaque; it had an even translucency to it so that it looked rich and bold, but a hint of the natural lip color still came through. The texture was firmer, a little velvety in the tube, but it took more pressure to apply and tugged on the lips as I worked it across my lips. It felt thinner, somewhat clingy, and overall, moderately drying over time, but it lasted for over six hours and left a strong stain behind. ",A-
MAC,ANYTHING GOES,Lipstick,"a rosey fuchsia. It’s a bright, medium red with cool, blue undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation, but the natural lip color is definitely going to influence the shade. This shade was on the drying side after three hours of wear, while it lasted for closer to five in total. ",B+
MAC, LEADING LADY RED,Lipstick,"a deep red. It’s a muted, medium-dark red with subtle, cooler pink undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had a velvety, smooth, light-medium thick texture that applied well without dragging or skipping. It had opaque color coverage that sat well on the lips. The color wore well for six hours and left a stain behind. It was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
MAC,JUST ADD ROMANCE,Lipstick,"a deep red. It’s a medium-dark red with subtle, cool undertones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage, though you can still see a hint of lip freckle peeking through, so it is not quite full coverage. The texture was a little creamier than some shades, which made it more comfortable to wear, and it may have helped prolong the wear, too, as this one lasted for six hours. It was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
MAC,KINKY ,Lipstick,"a vivid neutral-red matte. It’s a medium-dark, subtly cool-toned red with a matte finish. MAC has released a lot of matte reds in the past couple of years (and they have some classics in their permanent range), so this just doesn’t seem particularly different from those past releases. It is lightly creamy, applies without dragging, and is intensely pigmented. The wear tops in at six and a half hours with plenty of color still going. It works well with the coordinating gloss in the small release, and if you’re in the market for a long-wearing, non-drying (though not hydrating!) red, it might do the trick.",A
BESAME,BESAME RED 1920,Lipstick,"a true red with a cooler, blue-toned base. It’s a brightened, medium red with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. It had full color coverage that applied with smooth, even color without dragging or tugging on the lips. The texture was lightly creamy but didn’t slide around (but it isn’t transfer-proof). It was comfortable to wear during the six hour period it lasted.",A
MILANI,ROMANCE,Lipstick,"a bright red. It’s a brightened, medium red with neutral-to-warm undertones and a smooth, matte finish. It was intensely pigmented and applied with even coverage, though the more liquid-y consistency does make it a little harder to maneuver around the edges. As always, I recommend trying to remove excess product from the applicator or using a lip brush to make it easier to apply. It wore well for eight hours with minimal fading and was a little drying after seven hours. ",A-
BITE BEAUTY,#078,Lipstick,"a medium-dark red with cool, blue undertones and a matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single stroke, and I was able to get the same level of coverage when I filled in my lips with the pencil. The texture was lightweight and creamy enough to maneuver easily along the curves of the lip line. I blended the color by pressing my lips together gently. This shade stayed on well for almost eight hours and was non-drying. I think it would work best with Amuse Bouche shades: Sour Cherry (cooler), Tannin (warmer) see comparison swatches.",A
NARS,DRAGON GIRL,Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink-red with strong, cool undertones and a soft, matte finish. It had medium color coverage, which applied evenly, and I found it somewhat buildable and was able to achieve semi-opaque coverage with two to three layers of product. The pencil felt smooth going on and never tugged on the lips, and the drier (but not stiff) texture made it easy to get crisper lines. It wore well for over six hours and was just a touch drying.
",A-
CHANEL,SCRIPT (218),Lipstick,"a slightly muted, medium-dark brown with hints of mauve and fine pink micro-shimmer. It had semi-opaque color payoff with a very creamy consistency that had a lot of slip and melted against the lips as it applied. The color seemed to emphasize lip lines a bit, as the color gathered there, but it didn’t worsen over time, so it wasn’t too noticeable from a normal viewing distance. This shade lasted for three and a half hours on me, but it was moisturizing.",B+
TOM FORD BEAUTY,PUBLIC DISPLAY (01),Palette,"a slim lip color with a twist-up “Lip Shaper,” where the lip color hides in the base of the component. This duo features a soft, medium peachy brown Lip Color with a slightly lighter, gold-sparkled Lip Shaper. The Lip Shaper is designed for enhancing and defining the lips, and it can be used to shape or “create an ombre effect” to the lips, while the lip color is supposed to be full coverage. Sadly, I really like the lip color formula in the duo; it’s very creamy, hydrating, and comfortable to wear with four to six-hour wear time, but the Lip Shaper formulation left a lot to be desired. I struggled with using the Lip Shapers as they often broke on me, as they were quite brittle, and the majority were very dry, so they tugged and dragged on the lips. They also had bits of sparkle, which did not work well for defining the edge of the lips nor did it work out for filling in the lips.",C+
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,HOT COCOA,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, orange-brown with warm undertones and a creamy, lightly glossy finish. It had a smooth, light-medium-weight texture that glided on the lips and didn’t skip or drag, which made it comfortable to wear. The color payoff was fully opaque and went on evenly. The color wore for almost six hours, and it was lightly moisturizing when worn.",A
TOM FORD BEAUTY,AUTOMATIC,Palette,"a light, pinky beige and a warmer, medium brown. Both shades had a more satin-to-cream finish rather than “velvet matte.” They were pigmented, average wearing (three to four hours), and hydrating. Shade & Illuminate Lips is a lipstick duo that features a formula that is supposed to have “rich color” and “adherence” with a “velvet matte finish.” The duos are designed to have a lighter shade and a darker shade, and they can be worn alone, mixed, or as an ombre lip look. There was also a dual-ended applicator–a sponge on one end and a brush on the other–but the sponge really did not work well to apply the color, as it yielded sheer coverage and seemed to suck all the emollient qualities out of the formula and left behind a drier, almost powdery texture on the lips. The lip brush worked, but for me, the tiny applicator was harder to control and took me three to four times as long to apply compared to a traditional lip brush (which has a longer handle). The actual formula felt like there was a powderiness to it that is not present in any of Tom Ford’s other lipstick ranges, though the formula felt lightly creamy, thin but not too thin, and smooth. Once I applied the color and actually wore it for a few minutes, I did not notice the powderiness that was there when I was initially applying the lipstick.",B+
BITE BEAUTY,MOLASSES,Lipstick,"a rich toffee. It’s a muted, medium-dark peachy-brown with warm undertones and a satin sheen. It had rich, opaque pigmentation with a creamy, smooth texture that glided on without pulling and delivered even coverage in one stroke. This shade lasted for five hours on me, and it was lightly hydrating while worn. ",A
ESTEE LAUDER,DISCREET,Lipstick,"a muted, medium rosy brown with warm undertones and a soft shine. It had rich, opaque color coverage that went on smoothly and sat well on the lips. The texture was lightweight, comfortable to wear, while the formula was hydrating and lasted for five hours on me.",A
MAC,FRESH AND FRISKY,Lipstick,"a soft neutral peach. It’s a light-medium, orange-peach wih a luminous shine. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque color payoff. It applied mostly evenly and wore well for three hours on me.",B
REVLON,INGENUE (145),Lipstick,"a peachy-brown with warm undertones and a soft, frosted sheen. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque pigmentation when applied to lips. It was a smidgen hydrating, and it lasted for two and a half hours on me.",B-
TOO FACED,SWEET MAPLE,Lipstick,"a plum brown. It’s a plum-tinged, medium brown with a natural shine. It had semi-opaque color coverage with some translucency all-over, so if you have naturally pigmented lips, this may look quite different on you as it is not fully opaque. The texture was lightly creamy though it had less slip compared to other shades of the La Creme formula, which was reflected in the finish–a soft sheen but not quite glossy. It wore well for three hours and was just a smidgen moisturizing while worn.",B+
COLOUR POP,CALYPSO,Lipstick,"a medium, rosy plum with warm undertones and a satin finish. The product was extremely pigmented with opaque coverage in one pass. It had a smooth, lightweight consistency that was thin and almost runny, but it had some body to it and spread well across the lips. It took about an hour for it to “dry” down to a true satin finish, and while it was not transfer-proof, it barely transferred after one or two presses on the back of my hand. This shade wore well for almost eight hours on me and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
TARTE,TBT,Lipstick,"a medium, rosy plum with a luminous shine. It almost looked shimmery to me, as it reflected light back. It had good color payoff, but it had one of the most watery consistencies within the range. It applied well but pulled into lip lines within a half hour of wear. The color wore for three and a half hours on me but wasn’t drying.",B-
TARTE,LIPS FOR DAZE,Palette,"five, full-sized of Tarte’s LipSurgence Lip Tints–three are matte and two are satins. According to Tarte, the LipSurgence Lip Tint is supposed to be hydrating, stain-like, and “silky, full coverage.” The major drawback to the formula is that it is rare they’re actually full coverage, and they’re somewhat hydrating to not hydrating at all (the regular Lip Tints are hydrating but the matte variations don’t add moisture for me). The value in the set is great, though, as all five are full-sized, and a full-sized one normally retails for $24 each — that makes this set worth $120! If you’re a fan of the formula or you’ve wanted to try one, it could be worth checking out.
",B
URBAN DECAY,STRIP,Lipstick,"a sheer medium mauve-nude. It’s a subdued, plummy brown with a luminous sheen. It had full color coverage (not in the least bit sheer!) and applied evenly. This shade wore well for four and a half hours when I tried it.",A-
GUERLAIN,AVARICE,Lipstick,"a beige. It’s a warm rose with a hint of beige-brown in it. It’s neutral, but there’s a healthy dose of pink in the color. Again my complexion, it almost reads as a subdued coral. ",A
URBAN DECAY,LIAR,Lipstick,"a pink-nude with a Cream finish. It’s a muted, medium-dark pinky-plum with strong, warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had very nearly opaque color coverage that went on evenly and smoothly. The texture was light-medium in weight, comfortable to wear, and dense enough to smooth out the appearance of the lips. This shade lasted for five hours on me and was nicely hydrating. The Vice version is slightly darker than the Revolution version. ",A
MAC,CALL THE HAIRDRESSER!,Lipstick,"a rosy mauve with a Lustre finish. It’s a muted, rosy coral with warm undertones and a soft sheen. It had semi-sheer color coverage that went on fairly evenly. This shade wore well for almost three hours but was drying.",B
URBAN DECAY,PROTEST,Lipstick,"a sheer peachy nude. It’s a medium-dark, subdued coral with a soft sheen. It wasn’t sheer, peachy, or nude (beige); it was fully pigmented at the very least. It lasted four and a half hours on me.",B+
COLOUR POP,TOPANGA,Lipstick,a mid-tone dusty coral in a satin finish. It’s a medium-dark pink-coral with a satin finish. It had rich color coverage that went on smoothly and evenly. The consistency was lightly creamy and glided on without tugging on the lips. This shade wore well for five hours and was lightly drying after three and a half hours of wear.,A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,ANNE,Lipstick,"a medium, orange-coral with warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied unevenly with visible streaking and was particularly prone to gathering in my lip lines. The texture was smooth, creamy, and had a lot of slip, which contributed to the application issues I encountered. The color wore well for three hours and was lightly hydrating.",B-
GIVENCHY,CROISIERE CORAL (310),Lipstick,"a warm, coral-orange with a satiny finish. It had mostly opaque color, and it had a satiny finish–not glossy but not matte–that gave lips a very smooth, even appearance. I noticed that the consistency of this shade was slightly looser compared to the others; thicker but not really thick, but it didn’t apply with as much coverage in a single stroke and tended to move around a bit more. If I pressed my lips together, slight lines would become visible where the color bunched up. Croisiere Coral wore well, though, and lasted five and a half hours when I wore it and was nicely hydrating during that time. I had planned to pick this shade up off of Sephora next time I placed a Sephora order, but by the time that happened, it had sold out. The only place that I know of that you can purchase online is from Givenchy’s website directly (and they still have it at the time I wrote this review). You may still be able to find it at local Sephoras, though. Because it’s a limited edition shade for summer, it is actually packaged with a thin, white leather covering instead of black for the permanent Le Rouge shades. I’m even less keen about white leather than I was about the black leather, because it’s still thin and seems like it will be scratched easily, but now it’s likely to get dirt and dust and stains on it.
",A-
MAC,STYLE SURGE,Lipstick,"a neutral coral cream. It’s an orange-coral with a hint of pink and a creamy, slightly glossy sheen. MAC Lady at Play is quite a bit darker and more red/pink in comparison. This shade was fully opaque, and it has a creamier consistency than the other shades–there was a wetness to it that gave it that glossy finish. It applied evenly and easily, and though it was creamier, it didn’t feel any thicker/thinner than the majority of the range. It was the most hydrating shade of the twelve colors released. Style Surge lasted four hours on me when I wore it, and it was incredibly comfortable to wear.",A
SMASHBOX,PINCH ME,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark orange-coral with warm undertones and a semi-matte finish. The texture was thicker, denser, and emphasized lip lines as the color settled there over time, so it wasn’t the most flattering shade to wear. I would recommend a lip primer or lip liner underneath to minimize settling. It had opaque coverage, though, and it was neither drying nor hydrating over the five hours it lasted.",A-
MAC,ETHEREAL ORCHID,Lipstick,"a mid-tone dirty coral with a Lustre finish. It’s a muted, medium coral-orange with warm undertones and a soft sheen. It had semi-sheer coverage, so there was translucency to the color that allowed the natural lip color to come through. The consistency was thin and a little clingy, and it only lasted two hours. It was a little drying on me, which is my typical experience with this type of finish.",B-
MAC,FASHION FORCE,Lipstick," a soft tangerine orange. It’s a muted, medium coral-orange with warm undertones and a light shine. It had semi-sheer to semi-opaque pigmentation that sat well on the lips and looked even. This shade wore well for three and a half hours and was lightly hydrating. ",B+
MARC JACOBS BEAUTY,HAVE WE MET? (108),Lipstick,"a shimmering warm pink. It’s a medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and fine gold shimmer with a luminous sheen. The Lovemarc Lip Gel formula is supposed to be “color-saturated, long-wearing, gellified lipstick with a sleek shine finish.” Have We Met? is mostly opaque, but there’s a little translucency as you can see my lip freckle peeking through. I would expect if you had naturally redder lips, you’d also see that come through and darkening and reddening this color. The consistency is very emollient, definitely gel-like, and the color applies easily without tugging or dragging. This shade wears four hours on me, which is average for lipstick in general (on me) but short of what long-wearing formulas usually is (more like six hours). It doesn’t come as a big surprise, given the high amount of slip this shade had. It was very comfortable to wear, and it was nicely hydrating from start to finish. Marc Jacobs’ lipsticks are vanilla-scented but have no taste.",B+
SHISEIDO,MURREY (RD305),Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark pink with subtle, warm undertones and a soft sheen. This shade had very, very subtle streakiness due the more emollient consistency. I didn’t notice it from a normal viewing distance, but it is visible in the close-up. The texture was smooth, lightly creamy, and easy to apply as it didn’t tug or drag on the lips. It had mostly opaque color coverage that went on evenly. I was able to get four and a half hours of wear out of the lipstick, and it was moisturizing.",A-
CLE DE PEAU,SILK THREAD,Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with subtle, warm undertones and a natural sheen. It had good color coverage that applied evenly across the lips. The texture was lightweight, had moderate slip but did not feel slippery or wet on the lips, so it stayed in place better. On me, it lasted for just over four and a half hours but was hydrating.",B-
COLOUR POP,MONEY SIDE UP,Lipstick,"a medium pink with warm, yellow undertones and a satin finish. The lipstick was richly pigmented with full coverage in a single swipe of the lipstick against the lips. It was lightweight, creamy without being too slippery, and esay to apply across the lips, though I had a bit of product pull into my lip lines. It wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",A-
SEPHORA,ROSE WOOD (85),Lipstick,"a medium-dark pink with subtle, warm undertones and a matte finish. The color payoff was fantastic with opaque coverage in a single layer. The texture was slightly thinner compared to most shades I’ve tried in this formula, and I had very, very slight streaking in places even after it dried down, though it wasn’t noticeable in person, just if I zoom in on the close-up photo. It dried down within 20 seconds on me but didn’t feel clingy, despite being thin. This shade stayed on nicely for seven hours and felt a bit drying after six hours of wear.",A-
MAYBELLINE,ALMOND ROSE,Lipstick,"a slightly brighter, medium-dark pink with subtle, warm undertones and a satin sheen. It had excellent coverage with a smooth, lightly creamy consistency that glided across the lips comfortably. It wore well for four and a half hours with a bit of color that had settled into my deeper lip lines, but overall, it was lightly hydrating and didn’t emphasize the texture of my lips like some of the other shades in the Inti-Matte range did. Maybelline’s Color Sensational line does have a sweet, perfume-y scent to them, though it did not seem quite as overwhelming in the Inti-Matte range compared to past launches to my nose.",A-
TARTE,FOMO,Lipstick,"a muted, rosy plum with neutral-to-cool undertones and a satin finish. It had rich color coverage that went on smoothly with a thin texture that wasn’t too runny or too dry. The color wore for four hours and did pull into lip lines slightly, though pressing my lips together would smooth it back out as the consistency just never dries. On me, it was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
COLOUR POP,HUMBLE PIE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium pink with subtle, neutral-to-warm undertones and a cream finish. It was nearly opaque in a single stroke, which covered the lips evenly with just a touch of visible streaking along the edges (but I didn’t notice from a normal viewing distance). The texture was lightweight, creamy without being too slippery or heavy, and comfortable to wear over the four and a half hours it lasted for. The formula felt non-drying while I wore it.",B+
MAC,POP BABE,Lipstick,"a bright, medium-dark fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. The color payoff was opaque in a single stroke, and it had a smooth, velvety texture that glided across my lips without being too thick or too thin and had just enough slip not to tug. It applied evenly and stayed on well for six hours. This shade left a stain behind and was non-drying.",A
MAC,ALL ABOUT PINK,Palette,"a full-sized lipstick, full-sized lipgloss, full-sized eyeliner, and a Veluxe Pearlfusion Eyeshadow trio (0.07 oz.). The lipstick and gloss are worth $31, eyeshadows are worth $20 (based on price per ounce of the full-sized Veluxe Pearlfusion Eyeshadow Palettes), and the eyeliner is worth $16 for a total value of $67 (not sure where they get $72 MAC and Nordstrom confirm it is $72 value as they are stating the value of the Veluxe Pearlfusion Trio at $25).  I will review the other kits as well — please give me time as there is a lot to test!",B+
MAC,DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL,Lipstick,"a mid-tone pink violet with a satin finish. It’s a rich magenta fuchsia with strong, blue undertones, and a creamy finish with a natural sheen. MAC Candy Yum Yum is more neon and just slightly bluer-based. It’s incredibly opaque–completely covers my lip freckle with not even a shadow coming through. The texture is creamy enough to glide on without skipping or dragging on the lips, but it doesn’t slip-slide around during the day, so it also didn’t feather or bleed on me. It wore exceptionally well, coming in at six hours, and it also left behind a stain.  It was just a tiny bit drying over time. MAC is no stranger to shades like these, though, and while absolutely lovely in so many ways, you may already have something like it in your stash. If it’s the kind of shade you wear often, then you’ll probably note the slight differences between all of them. If you rarely do, you could skip.",A
MAC,AMBROSIAL,Lipstick,"a bold, medium-dark fuchsia magenta with pink undertones and a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that applied evenly and smoothly. The consistency was lightly tacky but wasn’t uncomfortable to wear. It wore well for six and a half hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
MAYBELLINE,HOT PLUM,Lipstick,"a brightened, magenta pink with a satiny finish. This is one of the more “subdued” shades from the range that I’ve tried, though it is still a bright, vivid shade. It’s not quite as neon in color, so for some, it may be more wearable as a result. Hot Plum had very nearly opaque color payoff–there’s a hint of translucency (but the trade off is that it doesn’t look heavy on the lips) but it looks rather opaque.  The consistency is lightweight, slightly creamy, and is comfortable to wear.  It had less slip compared to the last few shades I’ve reviewed, but it didn’t pull or tug on the lips when I applied it.  Hot Plum wore for six hours and left a lingering stain behind.  I found this shade neither hydrating nor drying.",A
MAKE UP FOR EVER,C207,Lipstick,"a medium-dark fuchsia pink with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. This was less glossy compared to the other two shades in this review, which may have been the result of a slightly thinner, less emollient consistency overall. It applied without tugging on the lips, and it was still comfortable on the lips, as it did not cling or dry them out. This shade had good pigmentation, though it wasn’t fully opaque. On me, this shade wore well for over six hours and left a deep fuchsia stain behind.",A-
NARS,SILVIA,Lipstick,"a radiant orchid. It’s a brightened, medium-dark fuchsia magenta with cool undertones and a satin sheen. It had intense color payoff that glided on easily and evenly. The color wore well for six and a half hours and left a stain behind. It was a smidgen on the drying side for me.",A
BURBERRY,LILAC (424),Lipstick,"medium, fuchsia magenta with subtle, cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. The color was good, though it wasn’t full coverage in a single stroke. The lipstick had a very smooth, velvety consistency that glided on with ease and applied even color across the lips. The richness of the hue itself helped to minimize the appearance of the color in my deeper lip lines. This shade wore well for six hours and left a subtle stain behind, while the formula seemed non-drying to me. The formula is described as a “bold, full coverage” lipstick with a “creamy, soft-matte finish” that is “non-drying” and “comfortable.” The lipstick formula has a very velvety consistency–waxier than like a traditional cream, as it was thinner but never dragged on the lips–with good pigmentation that typically applied evenly. The one issue I experienced with most of the shades I tried (only six) was there was some color that had settled into my lip lines noticeably, whether shortly after applying or as the color wore. Most shades lasted four hours with some that lasted for six hours, and the formula was comfortable and non-drying.",A-
URBAN DECAY,CRANK,Lipstick,"a bright berry fuchsia with a Mega Matte finish. It’s a bright, medium-dark magenta purple with warm, pink undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation that went on fairly evenly. The texture was firmer but didn’t tug much on the lips when I applied it directly from the tube. It wore well for seven hours, left behind a strong stain, and was moderately drying. I also have no idea what happened during production, but the exterior of my tube has almost a copper sheen/overspray that disappears as soon as I used it and revealed a more magenta core.",B
TARTE,SURFER GIRL,Lipstick,"a bright, medium magenta with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. It had good color payoff with a creamy, glide-on consistency that didn’t drag and applied evenly. This particular shade seemed to emphasize lip lines slightly, while the color itself started to gather in lip lines after three hours of wear–it lasted for closer to six hours and left behind a stain. It actually was a shade that seemed to wear better if blotted down initially, as it reduced some of the thickness and slip but didn’t impact the intensity of the shade. It was neither drying nor hydrating on me. ",B+
BITE BEAUTY,STIR,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, magenta purple with warm, pink undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff in a single layer, which was somewhat buildable, though the texture felt a little slippery with a second layer so it was harder to maintain. The more emollient quality of this particular shade made it more prone to pulling into my lip lines. It wore well for five hours, left a faint stain behind, and was lightly hydrating over time.",B
YVES SAINT LAURENT,POURPRE PREVIEW (16),Lipgloss,"a vibrant, fuchsia-purple with a glossy, creamy finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage, and the texture I’ve come to expect from YSL’s Glossy Stains: light-medium in thickness, gel-like, mostly non-sticky, and very glossy. This color wore virtually as long as I wanted to, but it wears well for six to eight hours and then loses its glossiness and doesn’t look as even as it did initially after that. I still had noticeable, decent color twelve hours later, and the best part was that my lips never felt dehydrated. It does stain over time, which helps improve the longevity. The only downside is that the color is less forgiving than other Glossy Stains for evenness, and there is a little settling into lip lines that you’ll see in the close-up lip swatch. Luckily, it’s hard to see from a normal viewing distance, and it did not worsen over time. Glossy Stains have a grape-like scent, which I don’t notice once the product “dries” down (the formula begins as a very thin, liquid-like consistency but “dries” down to a gel-like one).
",A
BITE BEAUTY,VIOLET,Lipstick," a magenta violet. It’s a bright, neon magenta fuchsia with cool, blue undertones and a luminous sheen. It had rich, fully opaque color coverage in a single pass. The consistency was creamy, comfortable to wear, and glided on without ever tugging on the lips. The formula was hydrating while worn, had a faint lemony/herbal scent, and lasted for six hours. It left behind a pinkish stain that lingered for another two hours or so. This is a shade that was unique years ago, but this year, we have seen many iterations.",A+
BITE BEAUTY,SATSUMA,Lipstick,"a fuchsia pink. It’s a brightened, medium fuchsia pink with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. It was extremely well-pigmented, and the color applied very evenly. This shade lasted for five and a half hours on me, and it was lightly hydrating. ",A
SEPHORA,RADIANT RUSH,Lipstick,"a radiant orchid. It’s a bright, vibrant magenta with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. The description is confusing: “[t]his satin finish moisturizing lipstick offers rich, matte color,” and the formula is also supposed to be hydrating, long-wearing, and comfortable to wear. It’s a satin finish–which is not matte–but it’s also matte. The finish is truer to satin than it is to matte, and it takes two and a half hours before that shine wears down enough that it looks more matte. It did have good color coverage, and the consistency was lightly creamy without slipping too easily. The formula was lightly hydrating, and the color lasted for six and a half hours and left a stain behind. I didn’t notice any scent or taste.",A
BITE BEAUTY,GRAPE,Lipstick,"a muted violet. It’s a medium-dark, magenta purple with cool undertones and a satin-matte finish. It had intense pigmentation that fully covered the lips in smooth, even color. The shade wore on for almost six hours, and it was lightly hydrating while worn.",A+
MAC,INVITE INTRIGUE,Lipstick,"a cool, bright fuchsia with a Matte finish. It’s a bright, medium magenta purple with warm, red undertones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff with a very lightly creamy consistency that didn’t skip or drag, but it clung to lips noticeably. This shade lasted for over six hours like a lot of the deeper shades have in this launch, but it was drying. ",A-
KAT VON D,HOLIDAY 2016,Palette,"eight miniature sized shades of liquid lipstick. The Everlasting Liquid Lipstick formula is supposed to be long-wearing, have full coverage, and be ultra-matte. In my experience, most shades are pigmented, apply well, and wear all day long. Some shades are slightly drying to moderately drying, but they tend to fade evenly and are one of the most comfortable liquid lipstick formulas I’ve come across. Six of the shades are from the existing, permanent shade line-up, while two (Plath and Roxy) are new. I had trouble applying two shades–Roxy and Echo–as they were sheerer, more watery, and ended up patchy and uneven on the lips. L.U.V. seemed a bit drier, almost powder-like, in its finish compared to the permanent version. I’m not sold on the set overall, but if you tend to like liquid lipsticks (or in particular, Everlasting Liquid Lipsticks) and take awhile to finish shades, I think these are sized right that you get enough product for many uses but will be able to finish them, too.",B+
TARTE,UNICORN,Lipstick,"a matte bright orchid. It had semi-opaque color coverage (the natural lip color still comes through a bit) with a mostly matte finish, though it wasn’t as flat as the other shades in the range. It applied slightly unevenly. The texture was thin, smooth, and lightweight, but the formula was still drying over the five hours it lasted.",B-
SMASHBOX,VINYL,Lipstick,"a deep purple with warmer undertones and a smattering of violet and red pearl. It had semi-opaque color coverage, which went on unevenly and looked patchy in places. I wish the quality was higher so that it could be worn alone more easily, but it, unfortunately, had too much slip and not enough pigmentation, so it is a shade that would be better over a lip liner for truer, more even coverage. It wore for four and a half hours, stained just a touch, and was moisturizing.
",C+
ESTEE LAUDER,EXTROVERT,Lipstick,"a muted, purpled-berry with neutral-to-cool undertones with a natural sheen. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with moderate slip and a thinner consistency, so it did slide around a bit and looked uneven initially as well as when I just wore it–a very high-maintenance color to wear. It wore well for four and a half hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",C+
COLOUR POP,ZIPPER,Lipstick,"a deep blackened purple. It’s a dark, eggplant purple with slightly warmer, pink tones and a matte finish. This shade was difficult to apply, as it wasn’t opaque and looked uneven on the lips. When I tried to smooth out the color more, it was already drying down, so some places were thicker than others (notably, on the middle of my lower lip, it looked bumpy). The finish is mostly transfer-resistant. The color lasted for seven hours on me with a stronger fade through the center of the lips than with some of the other shades. It was somewhat drying after five hours of wear.",C+
NARS,KATE,Lipstick,"a slightly muted, medium purple with warm, pink undertones and a creamy, lightly glossy finish. The color payoff was intense–totally opaque in one pass–and went on evenly. The consistency was smooth, creamy, and never tugged on the lips as I applied it. This shade lasted for over six hours, left a fuchsia-tinted stain behind, and was neither drying nor hydrating. ",A
KAT VON D,LUV,Lipstick,"a medium-dakr purple with warm, pink undertones and a cream finish. It had good color coverage, though it wasn’t opaque, and it took two to three layers to get full coverage. The lipstick yielded a light sheen on the lips, but the texture was rather dense and firmer in the tube, so it applied best with short strokes to avoid pulling on my lips unnecessarily. It applied evenly and lasted for seven hours on me with a neither drying nor hydrating feel.",A-
MAYBELLINE,VIBRANT VIOLET,Lipstick,"a brightened, purple with strong, pink undertones giving it a warmer undertone overall paired with a satin finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage with a lightly creamy consistency so the color applied evenly. The color lasted for five and a half hours, while the formula was neither drying nor hydrating but fairly comfortable to wear.",A-
ANASTASIA,VINTAGE,Lipstick,"a royal purple. It’s a medium-dark, eggplant purple with warm pink undertones and a matte finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage, though it isn’t fully pigmented and there’s a sheerness to it, so if you have naturally redder lips, I’d expect this to look less purple on. It had an almost two-tone aspect to it, as parts of it looked pinker and other parts looked purpler, and this was especially noticeable along the edges. The texture is thin, watery initially but dries down and adheres to the lips. You’ll want to be careful while waiting for it to dry down, as it gets tackier and tackier while it sets, so if you touch your lips together while it is drying, you’ll lift the color off in sections. Once dry, it’s nearly transfer-proof for me, and I don’t have any issues drinking coffee with this on. It will make it through most of a meal, but it will depend on how much oil is in your meal. On me, the color wears for six hours, but it is moderately drying and gets uncomfortable to wear after three hours of wear for me.",B-
ANASTASIA,RAGE,Lipstick,"a rich, medium-dark purple with warmer, pink undertones and a matte finish. It had good pigmentation, though it was not quite opaque, and the coverage did not appear streaky but it did seem deeper and lighter in places. This would be a shade I’d recommend wearing with a lip liner for absolute coverage and precision. The consistency was lightweight in feel, but the lipstick was dense and firm in the tube, so it tugged quite a bit when I applied it to my lips. It lasted well for over six hours and was neither drying nor hydrating.",B+
SMASHBOX,VIOLET RIOT,Lipstick,"a medium-dark purple with subtle, warm undertones and a satin finish. It had good pigmentation, but some of the natural lip color was still visible. The texture was lightweight, lightly creamy without being too slippery, and comfortable to wear. On me, this lipstick wore nicely for five and a half hours and was lightly hydrating.",A-
URBAN DECAY,PANDEMONIUM,Lipstick,"a bright purple with a Mega Matte finish. It’s a dark, red-toned purple with a satin finish and very, very fine micro-shimmer. You might notice my description is very similar to that of Jawbreaker, and to me, they are very similar–this shade is very slightly cooler-toned. Unfortunately, it is also drier, stiffer, and hard to apply evenly. It had slightly better coverage, though still semi-opaque. It lasted for six hours and was lightly drying. ",C+
MAC,EPIC,Lipstick,"a muted, medium-dark purple with neutral-to-warm undertones and a cream finish. It had rich color payoff with a smooth, lightly creamy texture that applied evenly and smoothly across my lips without dragging. This shade stayed on well for five and a half hours and was lightly hydrating over time.",A
KAT VON D,OZZY,Lipstick,"a medium purple with warm, pink undertones and a cream finish. It was richly pigmented with a smooth, lightly creamy texture that glided across the lips without tugging. The texture was more forgiving and easier to work with than several others in the range; if only they were all in this realm! The color applied evenly and stayed on well for five and a half hours with a non-drying feel over time.",A
URBAN DECAY,TWITCH,Lipstick,"a slightly bright, medium-dark purple with cooler undertones and very, very fine pearl. I wouldn’t describe the finish as metallic or even pearly, but there was a subtle sheen. The consistency was thinner, not really watery but could have more substance to it, and it applied fairly evenly. It had semi-opaque pigmentation but a second layer would be needed for full coverage. This shade did seem to pull into my lip lines and appear “cracked” as I smiled. It lasted for five hours before flaking off and fading strongly from the center of the mouth, though it was non-drying.",B-
MELT COSMETICS,BY STARLIGHT,Lipstick,"a medium-dark, pink-toned purple with a matte finish. It had mostly opaque color payoff, and this shade was a little creamier than the other two, but there is still some tugging/pulling during application. This shade wore well for eight hours but some color had pulled into the lines of the lips. It was somewhat drying when I wore it. ",B
ILLAMASQUA,ESP,Lipstick,"a vivid violet. It’s a rich, violet purple with pink undertones and a matte finish. Nothing that I could think of seemed to come very close–this is very purple; not pink, not fuchsia, and then not ultra dark/vampy. Though it’s a more unique color, and anyone who’s been on the hunt for a brightened purple will be tempted by ESP, the texture is very, very unforgiving. It’s incredibly dry, which made application problematic, wear uncomfortable, and the color looked dry and patchy applied. I would highly recommend laying down a smidgen of balm first–just enough to make everything smooth over better–and applying the color with a lip brush.It’s very easy to break the bullet because of how much pressure you exert just to swipe the lipstick across the lips (it tugs, drags, and pulls). It will come as no surprise but this is uncomfortable to wear, because it feels like it is clinging to the lips and is somewhat drying (but not as drying as it looks). The upside, I guess, is because it is clingy, whatever you do apply will last quite awhile (six hours for me).",D+
NARS,BADEN BADEN,Lipgloss,"a deep burgundy with subtle, cool undertones and a cream finish. It had good pigmentation, though it wasn’t opaque and with the thickness of the texture, I wouldn’t recommend a second layer as it would feel quite heavy and have a lot of movement. The gloss pulled into my lip lines and did not appear as even as other shades (made more apparent by the lack of opacity). It was moderately tacky but comfortable to wear over the five hours it lasted for as it was hydrating.",B-
NARS,MIND GAME,Palette,"a new, limited edition set that features six miniature sized Velvet Lip Glides with three exclusive shades and three from the permanent range. The set will be exclusive to Sephora and available November 1st (but it might go up earlier based on my experience). Since the Velvet Lip Glide formula just released, I only tested the wear of the new shades (and I did not re-swatch the existing shades, but I did check them against the permanent line and did not notice any differences in color or texture), so the ratings for the three shades from the permanent range are based on my previous testing of them. Overall, the set is nice; I think it’s well-worth checking out if this is the type of formula that tickles your fancy. The only downside is that they’re all darker shades, which seems to suit the feel of the collection but may not be enough variety for a set.",A
ANASTASIA,FALL 2016,Palette,"six, miniature-sized glosses in six, new and exclusive shades. I’m a big fan of Anastasia’s gloss formula for something more pigmented, longer wearing, and hydrating over time. On the whole, the set is nice–the colors are very autumnal, and for the most part, they applied well, had good color coverage, and were moisturizing and comfortable to wear.
",A-
NARS,MISSISSIPPI,Lipgloss,"a rich plum with cool, pink undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff in a single layer, but the slightly heavier, thicker texture did not make a second layer comfortable or that manageable (too much movement and product on the lips). The gloss was moderately tacky, especially after an hour or two of wear, but I felt like it was comfortable to wear overall. This shade wore well for five and a half hours and felt moisturizing while worn.
",A-
CHANEL,DIMITRI (442),Lipstick," a pink red. It’s a brightened, medium red with subtly cool, pink tones and a luminous finish. On me, it tends to read warmer, though it is cool-toned to neutral-toned (it’s particularly apparent when swatched or viewed next to warmer reds). It had mostly opaque pigmentation that went on evenly and looked smooth on the lips. It wore well for four and a half hours and was lightly hydrating over time. ",A-
TOM FORD BEAUTY,SECRET ESCORT (07),Palette,"a slim lip color with a twist-up “Lip Shaper,” where the lip color hides in the base of the component. It’s a cooler, pinky-red set of shades with the Lip Color being brighter and glossier, and the Lip Shaper being more subdued and darker. The Lip Shaper is designed for enhancing and defining the lips, and it can be used to shape or “create an ombre effect” to the lips, while the lip color is supposed to be full coverage. Sadly, I really like the lip color formula in the duo; it’s very creamy, hydrating, and comfortable to wear with four to six-hour wear time, but the Lip Shaper formulation left a lot to be desired. I struggled with using the Lip Shapers as they often broke on me, as they were quite brittle, and the majority were very dry, so they tugged and dragged on the lips. They also had bits of sparkle, which did not work well for defining the edge of the lips nor did it work out for filling in the lips.",B-
REVLON,FLIRTATIOUS (125),Lipstick,"a cool-toned, pinky-red with subtle ruby red shimmer. Applied, it’s a luscious, deeper pinky-red with a glossy, luminous shine. It had semi-opaque color coverage where the natural lip color peeked through only slightly. The color wore well for four and a half hours, and it did leave a slight stain as it wore away, and it was moderately hydrating.",A
BUXOM,SCOUNDREL,Lipstick,"a blue red. It’s a medium-dark, blue-based red with cool undertones and a glossy finish. One of the ways Scoundrel stands out from a sea of red lipsticks is the glossy sheen–it’s not a gloss, but it’s a very creamy, intensely pigmented red with a natural shine. It looks juicy and almost wet once applied, and the finish is just very flattering on the lips as it doesn’t look heavy, settle into lip lines, or emphasize any imperfections you may find on the lip. The formula is also nicely hydrating both during wear and after the colors wears off, and this shade lasted six and a half hours, plus a residual stain. Full-Bodied Lipsticks are quickly becoming one of my favorite lipstick formulas for creamy color.
",A+
ESTEE LAUDER,VENGEFUL RED,Lipstick,"a deep cool red. It’s a vibrant, medium-dark red with cool, blue undertones and a luminous sheen. It had fully opaque color coverage applied to the lips, and it went on evenly and smoothly. This color wore well for six and a half hours and left a stain behind, and the formula was somewhat hydrating.",A+
TOO FACED,MELTED RUBY,Lipstick,"a blood red. It’s a vibrant, medium-dark cherry red with cool, pinky undertones and a satin finish. This shade was slightly glossier than the other two, but it still had the same rich, intense pigmentation. The consistency was a little thinner, so I felt like it wasn’t quite as easy to apply as the other two. It wore well for eight hours and again, a stain lingered for a few hours after. ",A
MAC,RONNIE RED,Lipstick,"a bright red with a matte finish. It’s a brightened pink-red with blue undertones and a modern matte finish. This is an incredibly long-wearing red; even by red lipstick standards. It wore six hours and was still going strong, and that was after a cup of (bedtime) tea and dinner. Ronnie Red had no plans on going anywhere any time soon! When I removed it, there was quite a bit of staining left behind and some of it persisted even into early morning. Long, long-wearing. It was very comfortable to wear, too; not at all drying, and I didn’t feel like my lips were dehydrated after the six hours I wore it for. It is fully pigmented with opaque color coverage. I didn’t experience any bleeding or feathering while I wore it. The texture is creamy enough to enable one-stroke color payoff and maneuver across the lips without pulling or dragging, but it doesn’t have a lot of slip, so it won’t move around once you’ve applied it.  The only “downside” is that it’s a red that we’ve seen before and by MAC, to boot, in the past few months.",A+
CHARLOTTE TILBURY,RED CARPET RED,Lipstick,"an intense, medium-dark red with strong, cool blue undertones and a matte finish. It had semi-opaque color payoff that applied evenly and smoothly, but you can see that there is a noticeable veil of translucency that lets the natural lip color come through. The color wore well for seven hours and left behind a stain, but it was a bit drying after five hours of wear.",A-
MAC,ROUGE EN SNOW,Lipstick,"a medium-dark red with strong, cool undertones and a semi-matte finish. It had nearly opaque pigmentation in a single layer, while the texture was smooth, dense without being stiff, and comfortable to apply without feeling slippery on the lips after application. The color was still going strong after six hours of wear and was neither drying nor hydrating.
",A
KAT VON D,HEXAGRAM,Lipstick,"a deep red with subtle, cool undertones and a satin finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage in a single layer, which gave it a sense of translucency and made it appear more natural/lightweight on. The lipstick was rather dense and somewhat stiff, and it yielded a thin layer of product that was very lightweight to wear but did tug on my lips as I applied it. It was not painful to use, but it wasn’t anywhere near “the creamiest” of lipstick formulas (where the brand got that notion is beyond my comprehension!). The color stayed on well for almost seven hours and was a bit drying after five hours of wear.",B
COLOUR POP,HI STRIKER,Lipstick,"a deep red with cool, blue undertones and a satin finish. The pigmentation was good–not quite opaque–but applied evenly and smoothly across my lips. It had a lightweight, velvety texture that had enough creaminess to glide nicely along my lips but smoothed out my lip lines, too, without getting into them. The color stayed on well for six hours, left a faint stain behind, and was neither drying nor hydrating.",A
MAC,FASHION PUNCH,Lipgloss,"a medium peachy-brown with warm undertones and gold pearl. The coverage was semi-opaque, but the creamier finish made this one noticeably settle into lip lines, though it went on evenly (which doesn’t always happen with this type of color or product!). I felt like the shininess of the gloss helped to disguise some of the settling from a normal viewing distance. This shade wore well for five hours and was lightly hydrating.",B+
MAC,SPANKING HAUTE,Lipgloss," a pinky nude. It’s a light-medium, pink-tinged peach with a creamy, glossy finish. It had semi-opaque pigmentation with a comfortable-to-wear formula but uneven coverage that was prone to appearing streaky on. It’s not the worst offender I’ve come across, but it has a messy to look to it without a lipstick or liner underneath it. On me, this shade wore for four hours and was lightly hydrating.",B-
MAC,OVERSPICED,Lipgloss,"a dirty muted coral. It’s a warm-toned, light-medium peach with a hint of beige and a cream finish. It had mostly opaque color coverage, but it was a thicker, slightly goopy, gloss that settled into lip lines and was troublesome during application. The color just didn’t want to apply or blend or move and look even. It wore well for three and a half hours on me. ",C+
MAYBELLINE,NUDE ILLUSION (060),Lipgloss,"light-medium peachy beige with soft, warm undertones and a cream finish. It had semi-opaque color coverage, but the consistency did enable the gloss to settle into lip lines a bit. It’s not as even applied as I’d like. It wore well for three and a half hours. MAC Fashion Punch (LE, $15.00) is darker. MAC Calypso Beat (LE, $20.00) has shimmer.",B
SURRATT BEAUTY,AU NATURELLE,Lipgloss,"a universal neutral with a kiss of gold. It’s a peachy-orange brown with faint gold shimmer over a mostly creamy finish. It had semi-opaque coverage (not quite the sheer as described), but the milky quality of the gloss really came through with noticeable settling into lip lines. The texture is thick and tacky, and the cream finish gives it a slightly goopier feel and look. It wore well for four and a half hours on me and was lightly hydrating.",C+
CHANEL,SENSUEL (11),Lipgloss,"a peachy brown with a very fine gold shimmer. It had semi-opaque color coverage and applied evenly overall, but there was slight settling into lip lines. I don’t think it’s noticeable except magnified/up-close. This shade lasted for four hours on me. ",B
NARS,BELLE DE JOUR,Lipstick,"a light-medium, yellowed peach with warm undertones and a matte finish. It looked a lot chalkier applied to my lips than it did on my arm (which isn’t uncommon with this type of color, in my experience). Though the actual texture did not feel dry and did not tug on my lips, it looked painfully dry–the color “split” at my lip lines and emphasized the natural texture of my lips. It had semi-sheer, somewhat buildable coverage that lasted for four hours. It was moderately drying on me.",D
